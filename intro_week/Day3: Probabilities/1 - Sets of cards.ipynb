    "# Sample spaces and events\n",

    "An event is a subset of outcomes in the sample space. Probabilities are numbers (between 0 and 1) assigned to events in the sample space.\n",
    "For example, when tossing a single coin, the possible outcomes are {$1,2,3,4,5,6$}. \n",

    "\n",
    "We can use the following set operations on on events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Union: $P(A \\cup B)$ (A and B)\n",
    "- Intersection: $P(A \\cap B)$ (A or B)\n",
    "- Complement: $P(A_c) = 1.0 - P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The complement of an even $A$, denoted $A_c$, is every outcome in the sample space $S$ that is not in A. \n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, if you take the union of an event $A$ and its complement $A_c$, you get the probability for the sample space $S$, i.e., 1.0.\n",
