    "\n",
    "While programming languages differ in **purpose** from natural languages, clear analogies can be drawn between the two kinds of language with respect to **grammar** (what is the structure of the sentence), **semantics** (what does it mean?), and **pragmatics** (what assumptions do I need to invoke to interpret the sentence?). We'll go over each of these aspects in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A language with a purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us use our native languages to talk about everything under the sun and to accomplish all sorts of things. Nevertheless, there is a widely spread notion that some languages are more suitable for certain purposes than others. According to Google autocomplete, \n",

    "- Greek is the language of mathematics\n",
