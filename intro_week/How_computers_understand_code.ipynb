    "Some programming languages know how to check for semantic errors like the ones above where incompatible types are combined. These are referred as *strongly-typed* languages, because the type of any variable like `a_letter` is known even before running the program. (Recall the name of the variable, despite being meaningful to humans, is nothing but an uninterpretable symbol to the computer). Java, C and C++ are examples of such languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, on the other hand, is *weakly typed*. In practical terms that means you have to deal with semantic errors due to type incompatibility while the program is running (they could happen when your program has been running for an hour). Strongly-typed languages rejects such programs without even attempting to run them, potentially saving you time. \n",

English sentences, in contrast, are often ambigious and can mean a number of things, depending on the context.
