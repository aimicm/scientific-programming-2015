    "\n",
    "One problem with CPR numbers is that the year is represented by a two digit number, because that leaves some ambiguity with respect to the year of birth. For instance, does *05* indicate a birth year of 1905 or 2005? Actually the CPR system has a rather complicated system in place to deal with this, where the century of birth is determined by whether the last four digit number falls into certain ranges. If you are interested, you can read more [here](https://cpr.dk/media/167692/personnummeret%20i%20cpr.pdf) (Link in Danish).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Exercise ** You'll be implementing an approximation, which expands the two-digit birth year into a full four-digit year based on what year we have now. The rule is simple: if we see a birth year that is less than or equal to 14 (the current year), we decide it belongs to this century, otherwise it's the last century. This heuristic encodes the assumption that we are more likely to encounter a birthday of a newly born than of a person who is 100 years old, and that a five year old is more likely than a 95 year old. While this is true in general, it might fail in specific circumstances.\n",
