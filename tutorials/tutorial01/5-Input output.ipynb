    "In scientific programming we usually write programs to process data. Such a program accepts some input, does a series of computations on that input, and outputs something. One example is the (fictional --- but you could write it) program `outlier.py` which takes as input a file with numbers and writes to a new file only those that are more than one standard deviation away from the mean. \n",

    "It is quite clear that the program (the thing that does the computations) is distinct from the input and output. The input is what we feed to the program, and the output is what we get out. \n",
