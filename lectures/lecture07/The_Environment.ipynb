Say, run a python script on a file, write the output to another file, and pass that one on to an external classification tool (for example **Vowpal Wabbit**). These pipelines can be stored as scripts, and then executed as often as you want. They can take parameters and are a useful tool if you work on a larger project, because you can run the same pipeline with different settings without having to write all commands by hand each time.\n"
