order
was
filled
quickly
and
correctly.
No
problems
at
all,
highly
recommended.
I
found
the
parts
I
was
looking
for
much
cheaper
than
at
major
part
dealer
sites.
The
delivery
was
fast
and
the
part
fit
perfectly.
Great
service.
No
complaints.
You
will
definitely
get
more
of
my
business
and
I
will
gladly
recommend
you
to
friends!

Honesty

are
very

to
have
and
I
think
that
they
have
both.
I
would
definitely
recommend
them.

which
was

very

Came
the

I
found

really
easy
to
setup
and
get
going
with.
Even
after
I'd
done
an
initial

myself,
I
was
really
pleased
to
have
a

from

asking
how
I
was
getting
on
and
offering
pointers
on
how
to
make
the

This
was
really

Used

for

for

Used

never

I've
made
two

on
CJ's
for
Fallout:

and
The
Elder

I
have
been
satisfied
by
both,
being
extremely
cheaper
than
the
Steam
versions.
The
Autokey
system
that
CJ's
uses
is
genius.
I
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
who
is

First
time
I
have
done
business
with
this
company
but
will
not
be
the
last.
Great
stuff
and
great
prices
each
time
we
have
booked
airport
parking.
nothing
is
to
much
trouble,
amending
mistakes
,trouble
with
my
computer,
telephone
call,
always
a
polite
and
positive
response
to
whatever
the
problem.
They
have
great
pricing
and
fast
turn
around
will
always
check
with
them
first.
These
cloths
look
great,
feels
great,
has
a
great
sense,
but
also
kinda
expensive.

I
tried
to
look
for
coupons
but
they
were
always
either
expired
or
not
available
to
be
used,
or
only
for
first
timers.

I
would
buy
more
cloths
from
them
if
the
prices
were
decently
cheaper
and
had
greater
coupon
deals.
My
online
order
was
promptly
processed
and
items
were
received
in
a
timely
way.
Very
quick
response
time,
reasonably
priced.
I
will
be
doing
more
business
with
West
Coast
Shaving.
Don't
know
why
I
wasted
so
many
years
with
disposable
razors,
DUH!
Fast
delivery
of
part,
easy
installation.
I
had
a
little
trouble
figuring
out
how
to
pay
with
pay
pal.
I
knew
the
camera
I
wanted
so
that
was
no
trouble.
But
changing
address
and
shipping
address
did
not
just
appear
had
to
do
some
moving
back
and
fourth
through
some
windows
to
get
everything
all
set.
The
lady
at
Expedia
was
DISHONEST.She
waited
till
I
gave
her
my
credit
info
before
she
told
me
that
the
reservation
could
not
be
cancelled..
In
contrast
Christine
at
the
Hampton
Inn
was
very
courteous.
Just
recieved
my
used
global
history
study
guide
from
Bookbye
and
it
was
in
great
conditions.

The
price
was
much
lesst
than
it
would
have
cost
me
new.

Only
a
couple
of
dollars
plus
shipping.

This
is
true
value
for
I
only
need
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks
before
exam.
I
receive
it
very
fast
and
it
was
perfect!!!
Quick
delivery,
top
class
product,
would
highly
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
Many
thanks
for
great
service.
We
worked
with
this
company
get
quotes
and
comparing
them
to
others,
and
even
though
they
weren't
the
cheapest,
they
were
the
best
value
for
our
dollar.
Wit

laser
printing,

and
small

usb-flashdrive.com
put
an
offer
we
couldn't
say
no
to.
When
we
got
our
product,
all
was
well
except
the
lanyards
were
a
different
color
than
we
asked,
but
when
I
mentioned
it
to
the
person
in
charge
of
our
order,
they
sent
us
the
right
color
free
of
charge.
The
quality
of
the
drives
look
great
and
we
can't
wait
to
distribute
them.
I
know
that
our
office
will
definitely
use
this
company
in
the
future.
This
is
my
second
time
ordering
from
PartsGeek.com
and
I
am
actually
taking
the
time
to
type
this
because
it
is
a
reliable
site.
Both
times
the
parts
were
correct
and
completely
functional,
cheapest
I
was
able
to
find
online
and
it
arrived
fast.
Definitely
a
trustworthy
site.
The
quality
of
this
company
is
reflected
in
their
awesome
products
from
clothing
to
vitamins.
Ordered
window
visors
and
door
handle
for
my
2000
Ford
Explorer.
The
price
of
the

parts
was
cheaper
than
an
auto
parts
store
and
shipped
in
just
a
few
days.
I
emailed
to
inquire
as
to
exactly
what
parts
I
needed,
I
received
an
email
back
within
an
hour
that
lead
me
right
to
a
shopping
cart
with
my
items.
I
purchased
the
items
and
they
were
shipped
the
same
day.
I
had
the
parts
in
my
hands
the
next
day.
Fantastic
customer
service
experience.
Next
time
I
need
parts
I
will
be
back.
Spoke
to
the
staff
2
times
over
the
phone
was
told
when
the
goods
would
turn
up
and
they
did
i
have
been
asked
where
i
got
the
goods
and
after
the
treatment
i
got
from
sports
and
leisure
staff
i
have
told
all
who
would
like
to
know
thank
you
very
pleased
with
the
goods
I
could
not
find
the
part
locally
so
I
thought
I
would
give
PartsGeek
a
try.
Hassel
free!
this
co.
is
great
and
the
web
site
is
easy
to
use,
as
they
say
DIY
This
is
a
hassle
free
way
to
get
your

the

I
placed
an
order
on
the
monday
and
received
it
on
tuesday,
unfortunately
i
had
someone
elses
order
:(


.

The
company
were
more
than
helpful
to
resolve
the
issue
straight
away
and
i
had
my
order
the
very
next
day.
I
would
defiantly
use
them
again
and
recommend

them
to
others
.
If
not
for
the
wrong
order
they
would
be
getting
five
stars.
Every
person
involved
in
our
sale
was
very
pleasant
to
speak
to.
Very
helpful
and
knowledgable.
I
got
my
order
on
time
and
I
believe
Express
Medical
supply
was
the
cheapest
so
far.."That
is
from
what
I
was
buying".
I'llsure
come
back!!
The
product
was
pictured
correctly.
I
got
what
I
saw.
It
was
easy
to
set
up
the
order
and
complete.
It
arrived
a
day
or
two
early
in
a
well
packed
clearly
marked
box.
Honestly
I
couldn't
have
asked
for
more.
You
can
easily
search
thousands
of
items
and
purchase
in
a
flash.

!
The
ink
came
in
a
timely
manner.
I
put
the
cart
ledges
in
my
printer
and
one
leaked.

I
will
never
order
placebo
ink
again.
I
have
twice
purchased
ink
cartridges
from
HotToner
for
my
C7180
HP
printer
and
they
have
delivered
within
48
hours.
It
is
worth
pointing
out
however
that
a
Cyan
cartrdge
that
I
purchased
last
week
resulted
in
a
message
on
my
printer
saying
"ink
cartridge
is
out
of
date".
I
pressed
the
OK
button
and
the
printer
has
been
working
normally.
Fingers
crossed.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
come
across
Shima
Uma
and
the
price
for
the
ink
cartridges
was
one
of
the
lowest.

I
ordered
over
a
weekend
but
the
order
was
processed
and
despatched
on
the
Sunday
and
arrived
Tuesday
-
the
earliest
it
could
have
for
the
delivery
I
chose.

I
had
e-mails
to
keep
me
informed
and
the
delivery
was
in
the
time
window
I
was
told.

I
will
definitely
use
Shima
Uma
again.
I
would
highly
recommend
this
type
of
car
purchase.

Fast,
friendly,
professional,
no
pressure.

Selected
car
on-line,
approved
and
out
the
door
in
no
time.
Everyone
was
interested
in
helping
me
and
making
sure
that
I
was
satisfied
with
car
and
terms
of
purchase.
First
off
I
usually
never
get
extended
warranties
but
when
I
purchased
a
Hisense
TV
from
Tiger
Direct
something
told
me
to
get
the
warranty
and
would
you
believe
one
month
after
the
warranty
expired
the
TV
started
to
act
up
shuting
off
and
on,I
called
square
trade
and
spoke
to
a
fine
gentleman
who
seemed
to
know
the
problem
right
off,he
over
nighted
the
parts
and
set
up
a
TV
repair
man
in
my
area
to
come
to
my
house
to
fix
it,
which
he
did
in
about
an
hour
and
so
far
I'm
a
happy
man.Square

The

Great

from
John

Jeff,
very
professional

and
a
lovely

with
a
perfect

delivered
to

within
3
days-I
couldn't
rate
the

any
more
highly.
Quick

a
few
days
after
the
purchase.

I
was
informed
via
email
at
each
stage
from
purchase,
to
processing,
to
shipping.
The
part
was
an
exact
match
and
name
brand.

Buying
from
PartsGeek
saved
me
$50
purchasing
from
them
instead
of
the
local
parts
store.


I
would
definitely
buy
from
them
again
and
would
have
no
problem
recommending
them
to
a
friend.
Haveing

i

stick
for
my
Son
for
Christmas.
Well
structured

with
very
good
buying
guidance
notes.
Ordering
and
payment
very
smooth.
Product
delivered
on
expected
date.
Product
fine,
but
packaging
was
minimal
and
slightly
damaged,
so
potential
risk
that
Barrington
may
want
to
consider.
However,
overall
very
good
and
hoping
present
is
a
hit
at
Christmas!!
I
ordered
a
couple
of
items
within
a
week
of
each
other,
larger
item
was
sent
by
courier,
the
delivery
date
was
not
suitable
but
I
was
able
to
change
it
immediately
via
the
notification
e-mail
saving
a
failed
delivery.

After
delivery
I
phoned
about
a
breakage
on
one
of
the
items,
a
replacement
part
was
despatched
the
same
day,
no
argument.

Brilliant
service,
thanks.
The
part
ordered
arrived
on
time
and
I
installed
them
with
no
problem.

I
used
the
diagrams
and
ordered
the
parts
needed
by
the
view
in
the
catalog
and
had
no
problems
installing
the
part
fit
perfictly.
This
will
be
the
third
Nikon
DSLR
that
I
have
purchased
from
B&H.

Other
members
of
my
family
have
purchased
cameras
and
lenses
from
B&H.

Every
experience
we
have
had
has
been
very
satisfactory.

Last
summer
(2013),
we
had
the
pleasure
to
actually
visit
B&H
in
New
York.

I
can't
think
of
another
camera
dealer
that
I'd
rather
do
business
with.
Great,
swift
service.
Never
had
an
issue
with
Shopto.net
and
will
always
purchase
from
them
rather
than
retail
or
anywhere
else
via
online.

Though
they
don't
encourage
obtaining
games
before
release
they
do
send
pre-ordered
games
out
in
plenty
of
time
to
avoid
disappointment
on
release
date.

This
has
more
often
than
not
meant
I
have
a
new
release
a
couple
of
days
earlier
than
if
I
went
and
bought
it
from
a
shop.
Excellent
service.
Great
product.
Helpful
and
friendly,
explained

didn't

and

which
I
needed.

and
no

Won't
use
them
again.
Couldn't
look
for
a
better
service
than
discount
supplements
provide,

package
arrived
the
next
day
with
two
free
gifts
inside
and
I
even
got
a
text
from
the
courier
with
a
2
hour
window
in
which
they
would
be
delivering.
It
was
the
easiest
airport
drop
off
and
return
i
have
ever
experienced
with
my
car
-
no
queues
,
a
helping
hand
,
friendly
and
efficient
service
and
sparkling
car
handed
back
within
two
minutes
of
leaving
the
terminal.
And

ten
days
parking

cost
less
than
a
taxi
both
ways.
The
future
for
me
is
stress
free
parking.
We
have
found
that
our
dog
is
much
happier
and
healthier
when
eating
Blue
Buffalo
food.

There
is
not
a
store
within
a
30
minute
drive
that
stocks
Blue
Buffalo.

We
were
so
pleased
to
find
the
PetFlow
will
auto
ship
our
preferred
dog
food
and
has
flexibility
built
in
should
our
needs
change
as
to
amount
and
freqency.

The
price
is
competitive
and
the
service
is
unsurpassed.

Thank
you
PetFlow
Very
simple
and
easy
to
use...only
draw
back
is
shipping
is
little
bit
slow
but
other
wise
i
like
the

very
much.
Great

very

The
window
regulator
was
OEM
and
received
it
in
one
day,
easy
to
installed
and
is
working
great.
We
picked
out
the
car
we
wanted
and
they
provided
a
car
that
was
as
good
if
not
better.

Not
a
problem
all
of
the
way
through.

They
had
a
special
offer
for
a
GPS
and
that
was
a
God
Send
for
us.

We
found
all
of
the
special
places
we
want
to
go
with
out
the
problems
of
asking
directions
in
a
language
we
don't
understand.
The
options
where
clear
and
easy
to
use,
I
found
the
item
I
was
looking
for
straight
away
and
made
use
of
the
student
discount.
Clear
and
easy
to
use
online
store,
offering
discounted
sale
items
and
the
latest
clothing
available.
Postage
was
excellent,
quick
and
effortless.
Your
unwillingness
to
ship
to
the
US
Postal
systems
APO
and
FPO
addresses
shows
either
breathtaking
amount
of
ignorance
or
is
a
willful
slap
in
the
face
to
American
service
members
serving
overseas.

You
have
embittered
a
customer.
Items
ordered
were
shipped
promptly
and
all
items
ordered
were
received
well
packaged.
I
would
order
from
this
vendor
again.
I
ordered
a
thermostat
from
Ingram's.
It
arrived
quickly
and
undamaged.
I
would
not
hesitate
to
order
from
Ingram's
anytime
I
needed
a
product.
The
exchange
was
pleasant
and
a
good
one.

I
love
Assos
clothes.

I
wish
you
had
more
deals
on
all
your
clothes.

Too
many
items
out
of
stock.

Thanks.
This
was
a
re-order,
which
I
needed
urgently.
The
lenses
were
in
stock,
at
the
right
price
and
arrived
before
the
estimated
delivery
date
in
superb
packaging.
Fast
to
get
payment
to
me.
My
first
MCM
order
was
for
an
item
I
found
at
MCM
that
had
gone
out
of
stock
at
another
online
store.

The
price
was
as
good
or
better
at
MCM.

After
that,
I
started
receiving
catalogs
and
have
placed
many
orders.

They
have
never
let
me
down.
My
first
time
ordering
shaving
equipment
on
line.
Very
pleased
with
the
service.
Shipped
on
Saturday
and
my
package
arrived
on
Monday.
And
that
was
across
country.
I
will
do
business
with
these
folks
again.
Also
the
razor
I
ordered
is
what
I
expected.
Very
happy.
There
is
no
email
available
to
communicate
with
the
customer
service.
My
first
order
arrived
with
a
pack
of
chicken
split
open.
The
rest
of
the
order
(some
suppliments)
was
all
covered
in
blood!
I
emailed
to
let
them
know
and
was
offered
a
free
chicken,
but
I
still
had
to
place
a
minimum
order
of
£10
and
pay
£4.95
delivery!

Hope
they
stay

and
will
purchase

them
again.
Low
Price

travelocity
airline
reservations
was
very
easy
and
gave
me
lot's
of
choices...it
even
saved
my
1st
attempts
so
when
i
came
back
to
finish
they
were
there...all
said
the
easy
way
to

your

ordered
new

for

i

Ordered
at
the
Los
Altos
store
in
the
morning,
picked
up
at
the
San
Jose
store
after
work.
Great
service,
great
price,
great
product.
Was
looking
for
a
replacement
part
for
my
car
and
found
just
what
I
was
looking
for
here
at
partgeek......ordered
it
and
got
it
within
days......very
satisfied!
My
purchase
went
well
with
no
issues.
Well,
as
they
named
themselves,
they
ARE
some
geeks.
Let
me
tell
you,
they
are
some
good
geeks,
at
that!
I
had
ordered
a
headlight
for
an
'09
Ford
E150.
I'm
not
certain
it
was
OEM,
but
it
may
as
well
have
been.
The
thing
matches
wonderfully,
and
is
extremely
sturdy.
I
was
Grade-A
packed-and-shipped,
too.
Really,
I'll
be
looking
to
Parts
Geek
from
now
on
when
I
need
to
order
something
when
things
go
wrong
for
me
again.
Thanks!
Ordered
at
12.30pm
on
Thursday,
everything
was
processed
and
dispatched
within
a
couple
of
hours,
and
it
arrived
on
the
Friday.
The
very
best
to
deal
with
Very
simple
transaction
and
arrived
promptly
and
as
described.
Would
do
business
with
them
again.
I
am
very
satisfied
of
workmanship,
front
end
alignment
and
services.
Will
be
back
again
Great
booking
system
and
really
helpful.
Very
clear
showing
of
price
in
various
currency.
Vast
choice
and
very
easy
payment.
I
have
booked
flights
for
my
entire
family
which
was
a
total
of
15
passengers
only
2
days
ago
for
us
all
to
travel
from
Dublin
to
Orlando
and
initially
found
eBookers
the
only
company
who
were
happy
to
deal
with
a
group
without
having
to
wait
48
hours
whilst
they
checked
with
airlines
etc.
The
agent
I
spoke
to
was
very
pleasant
and
very
clear
when
recapping
everything,
although
he
did
state
that
the
system
they
use
was
having
problems
a
number
of
times
which
didnt
fill
me
with
confidence
when
spending
so
much
on
flights
for
so
many.

After
a
lengthy
call
to
get
all
the
details
and
another
shorter
1
to
book
the
flights
all
was
apparently
sorted
and
correct.
However
even
though
the
agent
had
read
out
all
full
names
phonetically
and
date
of
births
to
confirm
I
still
found
on
the
confirmation
email
that
he
had
got
the
middle
name
and
date
of
birth
of
my
brother
in
law
incorrect.
I
have
called
again
yesterday
to
have
this
corrected
by
eBookers
who
promised
to
action
this
but
after
a
few
hours
of
checking
online
I
could
see
no
change
so
I
contacted
them
again
via
Live
chat
on
their
website
and
this
Agent
had
no
record
of
my
previous
call.
They
have
confirmed
the
corrections
have
been
made
and
sent
to
airlines
and
TSA
but
I
cannot
see
this
as
will
take
their
systems
48
to
72
hours
to
update
(begs
the
question
how
old
is
their
comuter
system).
So
after
all
of
this
the
airline
has
sent
confirmation
now
still
showing
the
incorrect
info
and
I
can
see
this
turning
into
a
Monster.
Easy
website
to
navigate
and
find
the
best
parking.
I
purchased
rebuilt
brake
calipers
with
brake
pads,
a
rotor,
and
a
parking
brake
cable
in
two
different
transactions.
The
rebuilt
calipers
were
rebuilt
beautifully.
They
were
cheap,
and
just
like
brand
new.
I
received
my
parts
quickly,
and
they
were
exactly
as
advertised.
I
sent
back
my
old
calipers
and
received
my
core
credit
promptly,
with
no
hassle
whatsoever.
This
is
the
second
time
I
have
done
a
brake
job
on
a
vehicle
using
parts
geek
for
buying
remanufactured
brake
calipers.
Both
times,
the
calipers
were
the
right
ones,
they
were
remanufactured
very
nicely,
and
there
was
no
trouble
at
all
with
getting
my
core
charge
back
(follow
the
clear
instructions
on
getting
your
core
charge
back).
I
received
tracking
info
for
my
purchases,
and
everything
I
have
ordered
has
been
right.
I
have
been
satisfied
with
parts
geeks
service
every
time,
and
their
pricing
has
been
impossible
to
beat.
Everything
was
just
perfect!
It's
a
no
brainer
really.
The
easiest,
most
convenient
site
for
ordering
contact
lenses.
I
don't
even
think/worry
about
it
anymore.

Was
great,
All
I
did
was
go
online,
pick
my
phone
models,
and
then
choose
whether
it
was
working
or
not
working.
There
were
clear
guidelines
for
what
was
considered
working
or
not
working
and
I
actually
considered
my
phone
borderline
not
working
because
of
some
cosmetic
damage
but
they
honored
it
and
my
payment
arrived
2
days
later!!

These

knowledge
of

are
willing

spend

time
needed
to
answer
almost
all
reasonable
questions.
The

For
a
Kickstarter
video
for
recording
an
audiobook
for
one
of
my
novels,
I
was
looking
for
pirate-themed
music.
I
was
willing
to
pay
for
licensed
music,
but
was
having
trouble
finding
good
samples
just
from
titles
alone.
It
came
fast
well
packaged.

the
fact
that

made
it
a
great

round

experience
My
order
came
quickly.
The
only
glitch
was
that
it
came
in
two
parts
without
notice.
They
were
four
identical
parts
-
bearings.

Three
came
on
one
day,
and
one
came
three
days
later.

There
was
no
explanation
with
the
first
shipment
that
the
second
one
was
coming,
so
I
lodged
an
unnecessary
complaint
with
PartsGeek
thinking
that
the
order
was
screwed
up.
Cannot
fault
these
Braun

brushes
in
any
way,
nor
the
price
and
speed
of

from
Molarclean.
I
wish
I
had
found
out
about
this
company
years
ago
as
I
could
have
saved
a
fortune.
I
found
myself
in
a
position
where
I
had
to
scramble
to
replace
a
lost
passport
before
an
international
trip.
This
would
normally
be
a
very
stressful
situation,
but
Rush

delivered
as
promised
and
did
so
even
faster
than
they
said
they
would.

I
provided
my
documentation
and
they
took
care
of
the
rest.
They
were
also
very
friendly
and
answered
any
and
all
questions
I
had.
I
would
absolutely
recommend
their
services.
I
am
so
pleased
with
their
transcription.
I
submitted
3
interviews
of
70+
minutes,
and
had
received
complete,
near
flawless
transcriptions
in
less
than
36
hours.
It
would
have
taken
me
weeks
of
using
all
of
my
limited
free
time
to
do
work
that
only
approached
the
end
product
I
received.
I
plan
on
using
REV
for
all
my
future
interviews
that
require
transcription
in
the
future
of
my
research
career.
Large
selection,
speedy
service
The
original
order
for
glasses
was
back
ordered/out
of
stock
for
over
a
month.

When
I
changed
it
in
order
to
speed
up
the
process
for
needed
glasses
that
took
2
plus
weeks
and
the
glasses
were
too
big.

Reordered
again
and
had
to
keep
emailing
to
see
where
the
new
ones
were.

Lost
15%
due
to
restocking
lenses.

Just
an
awful
experience.

Shop
online
somewhere
else.
Fast
shipping
and
just
as
described.
Will
use
them
again.
Brilliant
quick
efficient
service
as
per
usual
when
i
buy
something
from
lightinthebox
i
always
get
them
in
time
and
always
satisfied.
i
really
recommend
this
site
thank
you

They
did
everything
you
would
ask
for
from
an
appliance
company
from
stocking
the
item
you
are
looking
for
at
a
reasonable
price
,
keeping
you
informed
the
whole
way
through
from
taking
the
order
to
an
hour
before
the
delivery
and
delivering
free
so
no
extra
costs
to
be
hit
with
after
placing
the
order.
My
wife
made
the
mistake
of
believing
that
the
Reservation
counter
website
was
actually
the
Holiday
Inn
website
that
she
usually
uses.

To
book
my
reservation
for
three
nights
direct
with
Holiday
Inn
would
have
cost
us
with
all
taxes,
blah,
blah,
blah
exactly
$409.20.

Booking
the
exact
same
room
with
Reservation
counter
cost
us
$480.19,
a
difference
of
$70.99
.
.
.
for
the
pleasure
of
using
a
spurious
website
cleverly
disguised
as
the
"real
Holiday
Inn"
website.

The
counter
person
at
the
Holiday
Inn
said
this
has
happened
before
to
other
Holiday
Inn
customers.
Recommend
to
anyone
over
the
other
optical
sites.
I
always

It
really
provide
me
great
help.
There
is
no
doubt
that
mSpy
is
a
good
monitoring
software.
Parents
can
use
this
application
to
watch
what
their
children
are
doing
and
where
they
are.
The
best
part
about
this
program,
for
me
personally,
is
that
I
can
monitor
calls,
emails
and
IM
application
usage.
This
means
that
I
do
not
have
to
worry
so
much
about
my
kids
since
I
can
intercept
their
activities
on
their
phone
without
being
noticed,
any
time
I
like.
Took
about
a
week
to
get
my
money
(I'm
on
the
east
coast).
Overall
an
easy
experience.
Will
do
business
again
Nothing
else
to
say
really.

They
do
what
they
say
they
will
do,
it's
that
simple.

Good
job
well
done.
the
service
worked
just
as
it
should
I
ordered
several
items
which
shipped
in
four
parts.

The
first,
an
expansion
tank,
was
the
only
thing
that
arrived,
inside
the
box
was
some
sort
of
"U"
shaped
bracket.

How
anybody
could
possibly
mistake
that
for
an
expansion
tank
is
amazing.
I
ordered,
and
received
what
I
wanted.
No
problems
and
quick
delivery.
Can't
ask
for
more
than
that.
Great
selection
and
pricing.
No
problems
or
other
issues,
went
off
without
a
hitch.
A
great
service
to
avoid
worrying
about
traveling
with
your
golf
equipment.

You
made

easy

accomadated
my
special

options

One
option
you
missed
was

Delivery.com
is
exactly
what
it
sounds
like-a
website
for
delivery
purposes.

I've
been
using
the
site
for
several
years
(exclusively
for
food
purchases)
and
love
it!
Even
though
I
was
deployed
on
the
other
side
of
the
world,
service
was
helpful
and
friendly.
I
am
very
comfortable
ordering
from

The
price
is
usually
the
lowest
or
equal
to
other
on

sellers.

Shipping
is
quick
as
their
warehouse
is
near.

I
can
speak
to
a
rep
quickly
who
knows
the
product
and
is
very
helpful.
In
my
opinion
the
shop
was
very
nice
and
clean.

The

helped
us
very
much
and
was
very
kind
and
peaceful.

I

i
will
shop

Best

Received
an

from

Tuesday
saying
the

was
out

they
were
cancelling

The
best
part,

it

Glad
I
didn't
need

As
a
home
mechanic
it's
so
helpful
to
have
a
great
selection
of
quality

that
arrive
in
a
couple
days.
They
offer
the
best

so
to
be
honest
I
wasn't
expecting
too
much,
but
the
ink
arrived
promptly,
and
are
very
good

I
will
definitely
be
buying
from
them
in
the
future.
Great
price
and
the
delivery
was
excellent.
We
needed
some
advice
before
bought
this,
and
they
were
really
helpful.we
are
really
impressed
with
our
Quooker.
I
bought
the
guard
dog
alarm
because
I
so
it
in
USA
but
it
only
had
110volt
system
I
live
in
Australia
which
is
240volts

I
so
that
the
guard
dog
alarm
was
sold
in
U.K
so
I
sent
an
email
and
got
an
almost
instant
reply
which
was
fantastic
and
the
rest
as
they
say
is
history
the
compay
that
sent
it
was
very
very
good
it
was
posted
same
day
and
arrived
6
days
later
it
works
really
well.



(a

large
dog
came
on
my
property
the
the
electronic
dog
gave
one
bark
and
the
large
dog
ran
off,
it
is
very
realistic
if
a
real
dog
is
frightened
off
by
it
I
highly
recomend
the
product)
once
you
find
the
best
position
it
works
very
well
even
through

so
I
am
delighted
with
it.
Very
pleased
with
the
new

I
ordered.
It

last
a
long

i
have
to
say
that
shopto.net
is
a
great
website
i
placed
an
order
and
got
the
goods
the
next
day
i
will
definatly
be
using
the
service
again
as
the
delivery
was
quick
and
i
didnt
have
any
problems
with
shopto.net
great
service
I
had
purchased
a
few
knives,
one
of
which
was
engraved,
as
well
as
a
couple
of
sheaths.

The
following
day,
I
had
an
add-on
order
for
a
couple
of
paracord
bracelets.

The
gentlemen
at
Swiss
Outpost
were
kind
enough
to
combine
the
orders,
thereby
saving
me
an
extra
shipping
cost.

But
more
importantly,
this
order
left
the
east
coast
for
the
west
coast
with
remarkable
speed
and
arrived
at
my
home
in
a
most
timely
manner.

I
applaud
this
fast
and
courteous
service.

This
is
why
I
am
a
repeat
customer.

My
heartfelt
thanks.
The
whole
process
took
less
than
15
minutes
and
without
any
complicated
sales
talk.
I'm
at
that
age
where
I
needed
to
try
some
varifocal
glasses.
Using
Selectspec.com
this
was
far
cheaper
than
any
high
street
optician
or
supermarket
optician.
Glad
I
found
out
about
Y'all.
Don't
know
much
about

computer
but
the
web
site
was
good,
I
found
out
what
I
needed
and
several
things
I
would
like
to
have.
I
was
surprised
at
the
arrival

was
very
good.Y'all
are
in

receive
one
part
that
was
incorrect
(label

at

Parts
Geek
was
very
helpful
and
quickly
refunded
my

I
was
then
able
to
reorder
the
correct
part.
All
the

were
perfect

and
most
complete.
Installation
was
easy
and
my

acts

it
did
when
it
was

Quick

received
my
order
in
what
was
expected.
I
received
one
item
with
great
delivery
time;
the
other
item
arrived
but
the
wrong
physical
product
was
in
the
packaging,
so
I
received
the
wrong
item.

My
problem
is
detailed
in
the
email
string
below....I
would
like
to
receive
the
correct
item,
then
provide
a
proper
review.

Thank
you,
Once
again
the
process
has
been
easy,
reliable
and
cost
effective.
The

Will
definite
order
again
when
I
need

Beautiful

Perfect

Used
the

twice
and
received
exactly
what
was
promised.

Flash-frozen
wild
fish
arrived
perfectly
frozen
to
my
door!
I
was
dubious
that
it
would
make
good
sushi
since
it
has
been
frozen
for
so
long,
but
the
salmon
sushi
was
actually
the
best
one
I've
ever
had.
The
salmon
has
a
distinct
intense
red
color
that
lets
you
know
it's
far
superior
to
the
supermarket
farmed
ones.
I
eat
fish
much
more
often
now.
Thank
you
for
providing
such
an
excellent
service.
I
will
definitely
order
again!
I
did
not
receive
confirmation
of
my
order
and
i
received
some
of
the
items
in
3
different
shipments.

I
emailed
customer
service
3
days
ago
and
have
not
heard
from
anyone.

I
don't
have
a
copy
of
my
order
and
that
is
what
I
asked
for.
Fast,
efficient
delivery.
Excellent
priced
products
and
great
customer
service.
All
great
products
at
a
good
price
&
were
delivered
in

Would
highly
recomment
purchasing
from
this
site.
However
i
would
not
recommend
allowing
any
of
your
friends/
family
to

I
have
been
very
pleased
with
this
company
and
would
definately
recommend
them.
Now
my
husband
has
no
excuse
to
cook
me
a
nice
stir
fry
as
he
has
the
wok

i
bought
for
him.
We
are
very
very
pleased
with
it,my
husband
is
a
chef
so
he
knows
what
is
good
and
what
is
not,
would
definately
recommend
these
people
to
others.
Many
Thanks.
Satisfied

I
have
changed
from
another
company
for
printerinks
has
I
think
they
are
far
better.
Fast
and
easy,
had
my
contacts
the
very
next
day.
I
like
the
prices
on
your
parts
and
it
only
took
2
days
to
get
them
I
am
very

I
bought
a
barbour
gilet
online.
The
webiste
worked
well,
good
pictures
etc
and
the
price
was
betetr
than
anywhere
else
I
could
find
on
the
net.
I
ordered
it
and
received
it
within
3
days
so
all
in
all
a
good
buy
and
super
service.
Good
prices,
quick
delivery
would
use
again
Luckily,
I
happened
to
be
in
when
the
delivery
took
place
which
was
an
added
bonus.
I
saw
one
of
their
delivery
lorries
on
the
motorway
and
have
to
admit
I'd
never
heard
of
them
before.
I
visited
their
website
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
they
included
negative
comments
as
well
as
the
positive
ones
as
a
lot
of
companies
wouldn't
do
this.
This
was
obviously
a
company
that
were
confident
in
the
products
they
sold
and
the
level
of
service
they
delivered.
The
product
range
was
excellent
as
well
as
the
descriptions
and
the
short
videos
were
a
fantastic
idea.
I
am
just
about
to
order
a
second
item
from
them
as
I
am
sure
the
service
will
again
be
excellent.
After
dealing
with
a

of
a

Speedy

(Y)
Sent

as
promised,
fair

no
complaints.
Ordered
an
amplifier
online
and
it
was
duly
delivered
as
promised.
However,
the
amp
wasn't
quite
up
to
par
(I
understand
it's
gone
back
to
Marshall
to
see
if
it's
faulty
or
just
poor
quality).
Anyway.
long
story
short,
amp
was
collected
and
a
different
one
delivered
with
the
minimum
of
fuss.
Received
updates
regularly
regarding
progress
of
the
exchange,
so
I
wasn't
left
hanging
in
limbo
wondering
what
was
going
on.
I
must
give
special
thanks
to
Elaine
for
her
help
in
the
first
instance
and
also
a
huge
thank
you
to
Dawn
who
dealt
with
the
exchange.
Helpful
and
courteous
all
the
way
through,
the
sort
of
staff
member
who
you
should
be
able
to
get
a
transfer
fee
for
if
she
was
to
leave.
Great
stuff,
wouldn't
hesitate
to
recommend.
Great
deal
&
speedy
delivery.
What
more
could
you
ask?
Have
used
HostelWorld
for
travels
all
around
the
world
(~15
countries).
Have
generally
had
very
good
experiences.
As
with
any
site,
you
need
to
know
what
you
are
looking
for
and
how
to
navigate.
And
you
always
need
to
read
hostel
reviews
with
a
grain
of
salt,
and
think
about
who
wrote
it
and
who
might
stay
at
that
hostel
(a
partier
might
give
a
party
hostel
100%,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you'd
give
the
same
rating
if
you're
not
a
partier).
Once
you
know
how
to
navigate
the
site,
it
does
quite
well
and
in
my
opinion
is
superior
to
the
other
hostel
sites
out
there.
A
better
map/compare
feature
would
be
helpful.
Overall,
however,
I've
had
good
experiences.
The
price
ypu
see,
it's
the
price
ypu
pay,
there
is
no
taxes
after
ypu
click
buy,
there
is
no
change
oc
prices
after
the
click
because
of

Great
and
fair
company!

Not

Finding

4th

Very

Ordered
two
side
mirrors
and
they
came
within
4
days
and
were
exactly
what
I
wanted.
The
only
complaint
I
have
is
that
I
never
received
a
confirmation
email
when
my
order
shipped,
and
I
had
to
confirm
the
shipment
by
looking
up
the
order
number.
I
purchased
my
fan
on
ebay
(auction
number
170619352551),
February
12th
and
received
it
on
the
15th.

Great

Each
time
we
got
off
the

we
had
to
wait
over
40
mins
for
the
next
one
to
arrive,
I
had
to
phone
twice
to
see
where
they
were
to
be
told
there
had
been
an
accident
and
were
trying
to
get
to
us.
The
original

managed
to
get
through
and
6

passed
us
while
we
waited
for
one,
it
was
very
very
cold
and
wasted
so
much
of
our

very
dissapointed.
Always

for

CHEAP

AT

FOR

No

this
is
the
best

for

Perfect
tool
to
find

I
have

and
called
them
for
almost
TEN
times.
I
still
cannot
get
any

so
far.
Horrible
service!!!

Don't
buy
anything
from
this
company!
Hi
All,
this
item
will
work
thanks
Ecomfort
was
so
easy
to
find
what
I
needed
and
place
my
order.
The
shower
system
I
ordered
was
a
good
price
and
shipping
was
free.
Everything
arrived
very
quickly
and
had
no
damage.
It
was
much
easier
then
trying
to
order
at
a
local
store.
Levering
en
afwerking
zoals
verwacht.
I
wanted
a
small,
UK
legal
knife
but
wanted
something
a
bit
more
flash
than
a
Swiss
Army.
This
fits
the
bill,
inspite
of
the
'made
in
China'
stigma,
it's
a
good
product
and
is
reasonably
priced.
I
have
been
looking
into
getting
a
ductless
system
for
quite
some
time.
I
finally
found
eComfort's
website,
and
they
had
exactly
what
I
wanted.

I
had
tried
to
get
the
units
here
in
town,
but
was
told
I
had
old
part
numbers
and
quoted
a
system
that
wasn't
even
close
to
what
I
had
spec'd
out.

EComfort
had
exactly
the
units
I
had
wanted,
and
at
a
great
price.
I
ordered
it
on
Thursday,
the
18
wheeler
pulled
in
front
of
my
house
Wednesday
to
drop
it
off.
Order
came
next
day.
Exchange
product
was
handled

Great

Supplement
Warehouse
a
leader
in

business.
The
great
prices
at
Supplement
Warehouse
allow
me
to
make
excellent
gains
in
the
gym
on
a
shoestring
budget.
I'm
speding
40%
less
on
supplements
than
I
was
at
GNC
"with
the
20%
gold
card
discount".
On
my
last
order,
I
purchased
$250.00
worth
of
supplements
for
$107.00
plus
$8.00
shipping,
for
a
total
of
$115.00.
Extra
money
in
my
pocket
and
an
outstanding
physique
under
my
shirt.........It
makes
good
sense!!!

I
have
been
purchasing

years.

I
would
love
to
visit

it

as
the

I
especially

Brilliant

Package
was
delivered
in
a
ver
sturdy
box
with
insulating
foam
and
ice
bloacks
inside
so
meat
was
very
cold
when
I
got
it.
One
of
my
worries
was
the
quality
of
the
meat
but
after
cooking
rumps,
whole
chicken
and
diced
turkey
I
can
say
that
it
is
not
a
problem
at
all.
Very
very
good
value
for
a
very
good
quality
product.
I
won't
be
buying
any
more
meat
from
supermarkets
again.
Very
easy
to
place
an

They
were
the

I
can

plus
it
was

Will

have

never
had
a

with

notice
they
now

look

Its
such
a
easy
site
to
use
and
recommend
it.
this

is
brilliant,
the

is
super
speedy
and
also

Signage
in
Rome

for
the

is
sorely
lacking.
Took
us
quite
a
bit
of
wandering
and
inquiry
to
get
to
the
rental
office.
Once
there
the
staff
took
care
of
us
very
well
and
had
us
on
our
way.
Part
price
was
lower
than
other
stores
seen
for
the
same
part
and
the
online
help
tool
provided
me
an
easy
to
use
tool
to
order
the
right
part.

Shipping
method
was
ok
but
not
the
most
cost
effective
method.
We
use
partsgeek
every
week,
and
they
almost
always
have
the
best
price
anywhere.

However,
if
you
do
have
a
question,
or
problem
with
a
part
it
is
impossible
to
get
in
contact
with
anyone.

Over
hour
long
wait
times
on
hold,
and
emails
do
not
get
returned...Customer
service
would
make
this
parts
supplier
unbeatable!

I
found
this

online
when
I
was
looking
to
purchase
a
new
BCD.
I
contacted
their
staff
and
they
were
very
knowledgeable
about
the
product
I
was
looking
at
online.
The
staff
has
been
great
I
have
had
to
call
them
several
times
for
questions
I
have
had
about
my
new
BCD.
They
told
me
when
and
what
was
shipping
and
it
was
100%
correct
to
the
day.
I
had
a
great
experience
with
this
company.
I
have
since
ordered
more
items
from
this
company
and
I
look
forward
to
purchasing
many
more.
I
have
told
many
fellow
divers
about
this
store
and
their
service
they
are
excited
to
find
a
new
sorce
to
purchase
quality

with
great
customer
service.
Thanks

around
my
PC
that
much
so
my
mobile
phone
is
my
PC.
We
purchased
a
used
motorhome
and
as
a
result
there
are
things
that
require
attention
and
this
will
be
our
choice
to
go
to
to
solve
problems.
Every
time
I
purchase
from
Heinnie
the
service
is
amazing,
the
price
is
competitive
and
the
speed
of
delivery
is
outstanding.
On
the
single
occassion
I
had
a
problem
with
an
item,
the
problem
was
dealt
with
promptly
and
professionally.
Parts
arrived
quickly;
I
haven't
installed
them
yet,
but
they
appear
to
be
what
I
ordered.
Orderd
my
appliance,
from
the
nice
and
easy
website!
Had
quick
reply
with
all
details
by
E-mail
and
excellent
text
communication
for
the
delivery!
All
round
a
cracking
service
Firstly,
my
bags
were
arranged
and
paid
for
to
be
collected
at
the
given
address
from
the
UK
mainland
on
Thursday
16th
May
between
9am
and
6pm.
I
made
sure
that
I
was
available
during
this
time
to
ensure
the
bags
were
collected,
but
it
came
to
17:45pm
and
still
nobody
have
showed
up
to
collect
my
bags.
I
then
rang
parcel
force
as
Uni
Baggage
I
had
no
answer,
the
women
I
spoke
to
told
me
that
the
bags
should
have
been
picked
up
and
had
no
idea
why
they
weren't.
It
was
then
arranged
for
the
bags
to
be
collected
on
the
following
day,
Friday
17th
between
12pm
and
3pm
as
I
had
to
leave
the
address
at
4pm
in
order
to
get
a
train
to
the
airport,
as
well
as
being
told
my
bags
would
be
upgraded
to
24hrs
to
ensure
I
still
received
my
bags
at
the
destination
on
the
Monday
20th
as
agreed.
It
was
then
brought
to
my
attention
that
my
bags
were
already
paid
for
express
48
which
is
the
only
option
available.
As
you
can
imagine,
this
was
extremely
annoying
as
I
had
changed
and
cancelled
plans
to
ensure
that
I
was
at
the
address.
On
Friday,
I
waited
and
waited
for
someone
to
show
and
yet
again
it
came
to
14:45pm
and
still
I
had
my
bags.
I
then
rang
parcel
force
who
told
me
I
needed
to
speak
to
the
stoke-on-Trent
depo.
Once
I
got
in
touch
with
them,
I
then
spoke
to
another
women
who
tracked
my
order
to
tell
me
someone
had
been
to
the
address
in
the
morning
time,
which
was
not
what
was
agreed,
to
find
that
instead
of
ringing
the
contact
number
given
to
them
so
as
I
could
let
them
in
through
the
security
gates,
they
just
drove
off.
I
found
this
woman
very
helpful
and
she
took
the
time
to
ring
round
drivers
to
see
who
was
available
to
collect
my
bags.
Eventfully
my
bags
were
collected
at
15:40pm.

In
all
I
am
still
very
disappointed
with
the
service
provided,
as
I
have
used
Uni
Baggage
twice
before
and
both
times
I
have
had
no
trouble.
It
also
concerns
me
that
a
driver
may
have
arrived
on
Thursday
as
agreed
and
without
thinking
to
contact
me
to
open
the
gates
just
drove
off.
There
are
a
number
of
issues
i
think
needs
to
be
addressed
with
the
Uni
Baggage
service
to
ensure
that
this
does
not
happen
again.
One
issue
is
the
communication
between
drivers
collecting
said
parcels
needs
to
be
addressed
as
the
matter
could
have
been
avoided
with
a
simple
phone
call.
I
also
think
that
giving
time
slots
to
customers
paying
and
using
the
Uni
Baggage
service
would
be
more
beneficial
as
saying
between
9am
and
6pm
is
very
vague
and
it
means
customers
can
plan
there
day
around
the
pick-up
as
opposed
to
waiting
around
all
day
for
someone
to
show
or
in
my
case,
not
show.
Good
prices,
fast
shipping.

I
will
definitely
order
from
West
Coast
Shaving
again.
They
had
what
I
needed
at
the
best
price
I
could
find
and
the
service
before
and
during
fitting
was
very
good.
I
appreciate
the
extensive
inventory
of
partgeeks.
The
online
site
is
easy
to
maneuver
as
well
as
navigate.
The
products
are
price
below
most
auto
stores.
The
price
of
the
bottle
was
GBP
350;
Grand
Total
(with
insurance,
delivery...)
GBP
450.
See
above,
plus
I
will
buy
again.
I
usually
order
optics
and
electronics
from
B&H
over
all
the
other
online
vendors
because
their
prices
are
always
competitive,
their
web
site
is
very
informative,
they
have
an
outstanding
inventory
and
they
have
never
disappointed
me.

I
know
that
I
can
trust
them
to
deliver
and
they
stand
behind
what
they
sell.

I
don't
know
what
else
I
could
ask
of
any
vendor,
so
I
will
continue
to
do
business
with
this
fine
company.
It's
easy
to
book,
just
be
very
careful
about
the
date
The
Shocks
proved
easy
to
fit
with
attached
crown
race.

The
Shocks

have
proved
easy
to

The
only
issue,
when
booking
I
end
up
confused
as
to
what
coverage
I
really
need,
and
end
up
paying
more
at
the
rental
location
at
time
of
booking
than
I
should
have.
Easy
and
quick
delivery
Needed
quick
birthday

I'm

-
good
quality,
good
value,
well
made.
I
shall
certainly
order
further
net
curtains
as
and
when
required.
The
only
glitch
was
a
delay
in
delivery
-
not
your
fault
-
it
took
Royal

3
days
to

despite
the
business
hiccup
in
January
2013
I
have
been
extremely
pleased
with
the
product
and
the
service.
I
recommend
it
quite
frequently.

I
love
Alpha
brain
and
always
look
forward
to
getting
my
bottle
of
it!
But
this
time
when
I
decided
to
order
the
90count
bottle,
I
decided
to
open
it
right
when
I
got
it
and
count
them.
There
were
only
87
out
of
90
there.
I
recounted
4-5
times
just
to
make
sure
I
wasn't
wrong
but
I
wasn't.
The
price
they
got
for
me
was
good,
but
their
customer
or
service
or
lack
thereof
until
after
the
fact
was
VERY
disappointing
and
resulted
in
unneeded
stress.
I
am
very
happy
with
my
choice,
the
have
low
prices
and
a
lot
of
size
options
so
you
aren't
paying
for
space
you
don't
need.

The
security
is
good.

The
business
is
simple,
but
that
is
really
all
you
need.

I
would,
in
fact,
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
storage
options.
Love
NextAdvisor!
I
always
get
the
best
info
regarding
the
newest
tech,
finances,
lifestyle
and
more
when
I
go
to
NextAdvisor.com.
All
parts
showed
up
on
time
and
in
good
condition.
Prices
are
esonable
and
shipping
cheap.
good
service
all
round
as
the
order
got
to
me
within
the
time
frame
stated
and
i
couldn't
argue
with
the
price,
i
would
deffinately
recomend
to
a
friend.
great
service
with
no
problems
what
so
ever
and
I
will
deffinately
be
ordering
from
there
again.
Great
selection
of
products,
customer
service
is
fantastic
I
got
an
alternator
for
less
than
half
the
price
I
could
find
locally.
It
installed
easily,
no
problems.
Shipping
was
weird,
however.
The
alternator
was
promptly
shipped
and
went
from
San
Bernardino
to
LA,
to
Dallas,
to
Ft.
Worth,
Oklahoma
City,
Enid,
OK
(near
my
home)
and
then
it
went
to
Corpus
Christi,
then
back
to
Dallas,
Enid,
and
finally
to
my
home
address.
Took
nine
days.
But
I
am
happy
with
the
alternator
and
the
price.
Thanks.
I
shopped
around
to
find
my
idler
pulley
and
was
provided
with
a
great
list
of
possible
parts.
I
wasn't
sure
about
the
quality
of
some
of
the
parts
but
I
still
got
the
perfect
part
at
half
price.
I
loved
the
variety
and
having
the
exact
part
that
I
needed
to
replace
made
the
job
super
simple.
I
would
shop
this
site
again.
Every
time
I
order
from
B&H
its
a
great
experience!
They
have
it
in
stock,
the
prices
are
very
reasonable,
and
they
Do
Not
Overcharge

for
Shipping!
That's
why
I
always
come
back!
I
had
used
Blackcircles
before
so
it
was
my
first

when
I
needed

for
my
Volvo
XC90.
The
size
I
needed
Quality
products,
good

and
immediate
delivery.
I
was
surprised
how
easy
it
was
to
use
the
website
and
some
of
the
great
deals
I
was
able
to
find.
The
process
went
smoothly
and
without
a
hitch
and
I
would
highly
recommend
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
deal.
I
would
recommend
The
Underfloor

to
anyone
as
there
web
site
is
clear
and
gives
you
all
the
information
you
need.
They
appear
to
have
all
the
products
you
want
to
overcome
any
quirky
design
issue
you
may
have
and
they
stood
by
their

and
delivered
the
day
after
I
placed

Via

Great

What
a
pleasant
experience!!
Gareth
and
Angela
of
eTyres
Cardiff
gave
great
advice
about
my
tyre
options,
worked
with
me
to
source
the
best
brand
and
model
for
my
needs
and
then
fitted
them
at
home
at
a
time
to
suit
me
-
all
for
a
fully
inclusive
price.
What
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
you
-
no

round

for
hours,
ample
choice
and
a
fast
and
efficient
delivery
with
the

in
individual

-
and
to
top
it
all
a

I
have
been
extremely
impressed
at
the
helpfulness
of
this
company's
customer

personnel.

They
have
responded
and
answered
all
questions
with
ease
and
no
hassle.

I
am
awaiting
to

the
Concord
TV
lift
cabinet,
and
customer
service
has
been
very
helpful
in
arranging
the
delivery
to
meet
my
time
line.

This
company
has
so
far
been
far
easy
to
work
with,
and
I
look
forward
to
a
great
product
to
match

with
only
one
minor
problem
.....
a
lack
of
communication
between

and
the

,
no

was
not
for

to
stay
out

for

nothing

Patrick
kane.
Boston
Ma.
In
two
months
time,
I've
learned
to
play
three
full
songs.

The
lessons
are
easy
to
follow
and
the
teachers
seem
to
really
enjoy
what
they
are
doing.

I
had
raised
a
concern
about
the
number
of
new
lessons
and
a
member
of
the
team
was
very
responsive
to
my
needs.

I
now
understand
that
new
lessons
are
added
frequently.
The
rucksack
I
ordered
arrived
a
couple
of
days
earlier
than
estimated
which
was
great,
and
it
was
in
perfect
condition.
I've
bought
from
them
several
times.
The
items
arrive
promptly
and
are
very
well
packaged.
This
is
the
fourth
pair
of
spectacles
I
have
ordered
from
SelectSpecs
over
the
years
and
they
remain
great
value.
Their
customer
service
is
good
too.
There
was
a
fault
with
my
last
pair
where
the
pads
separated
from
the
bridge.
They
asked
me
to
upload
a
photo
of
the
fault
and
within
24
hours
they
replied
they
were
going
to
make
me
up
a
new
pair.
Customers
should
realise
that
different
types
of
glasses
have
different
delivery
times,
however
SelectSpecs
have
always
delivered
my
rimless
orders
by
the
ten
working
days,
i.e.
two
weeks
I
placed
an
order
and
it
said
it
would
arrive
in
5
-
10
days
(I
think,
I
don't
quite
remember.
Even
so
that's
a
long
time
to
wait)
and
it
didn't
arrive
until
I
called,
twice.
I
had
waited
3
weeks
and
still
nothing.
Found
the
item
I
wanted
cheaper
than
Amazon!
TCP
brand
led
bulbs,
based
on
my
experience
with
them
and
my
research
on
the
net,
One
of
the
better
suppliers
for
on-hand
products
and
great
customer
service!
Ordered
an
exhaust
manifold
for
a
Trail
Blazer
and
got
it
within
a
week.
That's
better
than
the
dealer.
And
the
price
was
great,
too.
Also
better
than
the
dealer
and
a
local
parts
store.
All
in
all,
this
is
the
way
t
shop
for
car
parts.
You
ask
me
to
discuss
to
you,
as
I
would
with
a
friend,
my
perception
of
your
services.

My
bonding
company
needs
my
input
for
renewing
my
$10M
in
performance
bonds.

I
signed
with
you
for
my
current
fico's

&
reports.

When
I
went
to
SCORES
,
it
cleanly
showed
the
(3)
bureaus,
side-by-side,
with
clear,
large
numbers.

When
I
try
to
print
from
that
web
page,
I
get
a
cheesy
vertical
set
of
numbers
with
very
large
options
of
membership
that
I
already
paid
for.

I
can't
submit
trash
like
this.

It
looks
like
something
a
third
tier
rip-off
would
provide.

Before
I
go
back
t
my
previous
credit
monitoring
company
&
canceling
my
payment
to
you,
does
anyone
in
your
IT
department
have
any
corrective
input?
The
guys
were
fast
friendly
efficient
and
professional.
The
cost
was
way
less
than
I
expected…
Overall
a
great
experience.
I
love
using
hostels.com
to
book
hostels
around
the
world.
I
use
it
every
time
I
travel
abroad.
It's
easy
to
use,
and
the
information
found
within
it
is
accurate
and
very
informative.
Easy
to
put
together,
plenty
of
adjustments
to
suit
most
people,
and
a
good
price.

Wrong
image
was
linked
to
the
product
and
the
item
that
was
delivered
not
as
shown.
Customer
Services
have
offered
full
refund
(inc
return
postage)
and
have
apologised
for
their
error.
Unfortunate
and
inconvenient
transaction
but
won't
put
me
off
trying
them
again
due
to
level
of
aftersales!
Towequipe
have
many
very
reasonbly
price
products
for
all
your
towing
needs
and
i
have
no
complaints
about
the
company.
However
the
delivery
company
they
use
really
let
them
dowm
badly.
It
took
two
attempts
to
actually
get
the
product
i
ordered.
Even
after
clearly
stating
the
times
that
i
was
available
at
my
work
address
and
wanting
for
only
me
to
sign
for
the
product
the
delivery
driver
never
even
asked
for
me
(
it
didnt
help
he
couldnt
speak
any
english
)
The
part
we
needed
was
easy
to
locate
on
the
website,
it
was
quickly
delivered,
and
I
was
able
to
fit
the
new
seal
in
less
than
a
minute;
and
it
works!
How's
that
for
efficiency?
Anything
ordered
with
Just
Kampers
seems
to
arrive
on
your
doorstep
immediately.
It's
a
shame
other
sites
can't
work
this
well
-
and
the
product
is
always
sturdily
packaged.
This
"firm"
took
over
supply
without
authority
and
proceeded
to
harass
and
lie.
The
telephone
staff
are
very
very
rude
and
the
emails
are
almost
as
bad.
This
is
a
family
business
thats
put
service
first.
I
placed
an
order
inquiry
and
recieved
a
phone
call
back
very
quickly
in
deed
with
all
the
information
i
required
in
a
very
honest
manner.
I
would
recommend
them
without
hesitation.
UPDATE!!!
a
flashy
website
but
that's
as
far
as
it
goes.
You
can
make
money
from
the
site
if
your
selective
and
know
what
your
doing.
However
a
very
big
but
is
that
the
links
often
take
you
to
special
pages
which
don't
enjoy
the
usual
discounts
and
often
Higher
prices
than
if
you
went
direct
to
the
end
site.
A
great
price
and
1st
class
service!

I
am
impressed
with
your

I

I

the
amount
I
wanted
due

but
the
call
I
received
was
so
professional
and
non-aggressive
that
I
went
ahead
and
signed
for
a
smaller

Came
within

and

was
exactly
what
I
needed,
great

I
was
pleased
with
how
fast
my

got
to
me,
took
about
3
or
4
days
from
when
I
had
ordered
it.
I
have
no
complaints
other
than
packaging
was
not
good
at
all.
Looked
as
though
the
box
fell
off
a
mountain
and
somehow
managed
to
survive
in
one
piece...
Luckily
the
item
in
the
box
wasn't
harmed
or
damaged
in
any

This
is
why
I
give

I
identified
the
part
that
needed
replacement,
did
a
search
online
for
the
part
and
this
site
came
up
trumps
and
after
ordering
the
site
kept
me
up
to
date
with
the
delivery
and
all
the
info
was
spot
on
and
delivery
arrived
on
schedule.

The
product
was

Ellen
and
as
ordered.
I
would
most
definitely
purchase
from
again.
Always
have
what
I
am
looking
for,
and
great
prices.

Too
busy
to
go
to
stores
and
this
website
is
answer
to
my
problem
!!
Our
order
arrived
in
two

--
UNBELIEVABLE
-----
It
included
a
new
radiator
for
a

(no

supplying
that)
which
fit
perfectly

Genuinely

I

to
give

I'm

I
will
definitely
be
buying
from

for

Very

with

for
more.

Regards
Todd
My
fiance
and
I
used
the
Big
Bus
Tour
service
while
in
London
recently
and
were
very
pleased
with
the
operation.
Even
though
it
had
rained
on
both
days
of
our
48
hour
ticket,
including
a
trip
to
Greenwich,
the
ride
was
wonderful.
There
are
many
places
where
the
bus
stops
and
all
very
convenient
to
find.

We
had
ordered
our
tickets
in
advance
and
only
had
to
show
up
at
the
stop
of
our
choice.

This
is
a
great
way
to
see
the
city
and
get
oriented
before
heading
out
on
your
own.

Will
use
it
again.
The
site
and
process
works
pretty
easily.
The
site
is
one
of
the
few
I
found
that
buys
CDs
and
DVDs
as
well
as
books,
and
they
even
took
a
few
books
that
some
other
sites
would
not.
That
being
said,
it
is
a
shame
that
there
are
many
books
that
they
don't
accept
at
all.
It
is
sad
when
one
buys
a
$30
book
and
later
no
one
will
even
offer
you
10
cents
for
it.
I
should
add
that
the
other
book
buying
sites
online
wouldn't
buy
those
books
either.
One
peculiar
issue
is
that
when
you
are
given
the
digital
copy
of
the
shipping
label
-
it
is
only
1/4
size
and
you
have
to
figure
out
how
to
expand
it
before
you
print
it
off.
The
shipping
is
offered
as
by
USPS
or
Fed
Ex,
and
payment
is
either
PayPal
or
by
a
paper
Check.
Received
my
order
on
time,
in
the
past
I
call
them
up
got
great
service
and
helpful
opinions
and
information
on
my
purchases
.
I
would
highly
recommend
this
site
very
user
friendly
Extremely
courteous
and
friendly
staff.
Very
easy
to
navigate
website.
Super
fast
shipment.
Lowest
price!
Will
be
back
for
more.
Thanks!!!

I've
used
Joker's

a
few
times
over
the
years
when
I've
needed
a

and
always
been

satisfied.

Products
are
a
bit
pricey
but
they
have
a
very
good
selection,
and
their
customer
service
is
outstanding
-
plenty
of

SpareFoot
was
very
helpful
in
searching
for
a
storage
unit
during
our
move.
There
was
a
lot
of
information
available
and
was
easy
to
search
by
many
different
criteria
to
find
the
right
spot.
We
wanted
a
climate
controlled
unit
on
the
first
floor
of
a
facility
and
those
were
among
the
options
SpareFoot
listed
to
help
narrow
our
search.
Lots
of
listings
throughout
the
area.
Using
this
site
saved
a
lot
of
time
from
looking
up
individual
units
or
calling
around
which
probably
saved
us
money.
Speaking
of
saving,
they
have
deals
with
moving
trucks
etc
to
help
with
that
part
of
the
move
too.
I
called
the
number
to
confirm
everything
I
saw
on
the
site
and
the
staff
was
very
helpful.
Definitely
recommend
using
this
site.
I
did
receive
my
desired
part
in
a
trimely
manner,
but
when
I
tested
it
out,
I
discovered
that
it
did
not
work.

To
get
top
quality
hotels
at
amazing
prices,
you
should
bid
at
Priceline.

I
had
a
business
trip
in
Fresno,
Ca.,
and
wanted
to
stay
at
the
best
hotel
in
town.

The
top
star
rating
was
3
1/2
stars.

I
checked
many
different
websites,
and
the
Radisson
had
a
lowest
published
price
of
$108.00
per
night.

I
bid
for
a
3
1/2
star
hotel
at
Priceline
for
$65.00,
and
got
that
price
at
the
Radisson.

Priceline's
star
rating
system
is
very
accurate,
and
I
have
used
it
on
a
number
of
occasions.

With
fewer
empty
flights
and
heavy
air
bookings,
bidding
on
a
flight
is
not
as
productive
as
it
once
was.

Bidding
on
a
hotel
room,
however,
provides
excellent
results.
Typo
on
address
would
not
resend,

have
to
reorder.
The
booking
was
there
when
we
arrived,
the
car
could
have
been
cleaner
but
nothing
went
wrong
with
it
and
the
returning
it
was
fast
and
easy.
The
Dallas
JPMorgan
International
Plaza
location
is
the
perfect
location
for
my
International
Tax
Law
business.

And
the
people
managing
the
facility
are
the
kind
of
people
that
I
have
always
tried
to
hire
to
represent
me.

You
will
not
find
this
level
of
professional
relationship
anywhere
else
in
the
business
world.
i
found
that
they
do
price
match
and
beat
i
liked
ordering
with
this
company.

i
also
just
have
to
add
check
your
order
i
received
everything
i
paid
for
but
not
most
of
the
free
stuff.

i
didnt
complain
cause
its
all
ok
but
i
placed
another
order
and
this
time
i
want
all
the
free
stuff
hope
i
get
it!!
We
used
Tripadvisor
for
the
first
time
to
plan
a
very
special
trip
to
Italy.
I
relied
on
the
reviews
and
ratings
to
choose
hotels
that
would
be
special
without
breaking
the
bank.
I
couldn't
have
been
more
pleased
with
the
results.
We
stayed
at
places
that
ranged
from
good
to
perfect
and
all
within
a
set
budget.
It
is
hard
work
sorting
out
all
of
the
comments
by
different
reviewers,
but
once
you
figure
out
who
is
honest
and
who
has
an
axe
to
grind,
you
can
make
informed
decisions
and
rely
on
the
ratings.
A
great
service
that
I
use
all
the
time
now.
Great
service
with
great
prices
for
the
food
we
use!
The
only
minor
complaint
we
have
is
that
the
shipping
carton
is
usually
mangled
and
ripped
by
the
time
it
gets
to
our
door,
so
it
can
be
hard
to
lift
into
the
house
because
you
can't
grip
it
without
it
ripping
more.
A
minor
issue
and
one
that
does
not
keep
us
from
coming
back
time
and
again.
I
have
been
looking
for
vinal
numbers
for
my
large
car
locally
with
no/little
sucess.
Went
to
my
faithful
computer
and
found
DIY,

this
is
a
great
product
!
Went
on
wwith
no
problems
and
look
great
.
I
wiil
use
them
again
when
I
need
something
like
this
again.
I
bought
a
pair
of
MTB
shoes
from
Wiggle.
One
shoe
started
to
break
after
a
year
so
I
returned
them
via
Wiggle's
free
returns
system
and
they
refunded
them
in
full.
Great
service
-
I'll
be
buying
from
them
again.
This
company
do
what
they
say
-
I've
used
them
several
times
and
they
come
when
they
say
they
will
and
do
the
job.
The
staff
are
friendly
and
competent.
I
had
a
problem
this
time
whereby
the
tyres
I
purchased
weren't
in
stock
so
they
rang
me
and
offered
alternatives.
Once
I'd
chosen
a
new
tyre,
a
new
fitting
date
was
agreed.
Picked
up
and
dropped
off
at
the
airport
short-stay
car
park.
Friendly
staff.
As
it
said
on
the
tin.
My
first
time
buying
a
game
code
online
really
and
I
am
so
glad
that
it
was
with
cjs-cdkeys.
Was
delivered
seconds
after
i
ordered.
I
highly
recommend
this
service.
Whenever
i
need
parts
i
order
them
online
at
partsgeek.
They
are
always
accurate
and
fast
shipping.
Great
choice
and
sooo
easy.

When
I
was
trying
to
decide
which
gold
company
I
wanted
to
invest
with,
birch
gold
was
a
step
above
the
rest.
Some
of
the
salespeople
at
other
companies
felt
pushy,
which
I
didn't
like.
Not
with
Birch.
Guy
was
easy
to
undersatnd
and
I
felt
safe
knowing
that
my
ira
was
going
to
have
a
little
security
from
inflation.
The
process
with
the
trust
company
went
seamlessly.
Since
then
I've
told
many
friends
and
family
about
the
excellent
service
from
Birch
Gold.
Cant
recommend
them
highly
enough.

I
think
3
months
of
waiting
time
is
already
too
long,
that's
why
im
crying
foul.
I'm
still
crossing
my
fingers
they
can
get
the
job
done.
As
for
now,
i
am
not
recommending
your
service
to
any
one.
Thank
you
for
the
fast
efficient

It's

would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone.
A
good
product
for
the
price.

No
regrets.
I
searched
around,
shopped
online
with
the
large
auto
parts
stores,
and
found
the
same
exact
parts,
brand
and
part
number
at
huge
savings
with
PartsGeek.

The
shipping
rates
were
less
than
what
I
would
have
paid
in
taxes!
Ordered
a
pair
of
medium
gloves
for
a
present
and
was
sent
a
pair
of
large
ones,
I
wouldn't
mind
but
they
had
large
L's
on
them
obviously
not
checked
before
they
were
sent.
Not
good
enough
so
won't
be
using
them
again
These
guys
have
good
prices
and
they
respond
back
to
you.

Will
buy
from
again.
Everything
went
very
well,
but
I
never
got
an
email
confirmation
of
the
purchase.
I
guess
it
could
have
gotten
caught
in
a
spam
filter,
but
I
checked
all
the
filter
queues
and
couldn't
find
it.
They
indicated
they
sent
it,
I
just
never
found
it.
All
in
all,
things
went
as
expected.
I
can't
really
give
the
5
stars
since
I
couldn't
find
the
receipt.
But
I'd
buy
from
them
again
if
I
need
something.
The
website
was
very
easy
to
use
with
lots
of
helpful
information
on
how
to
measure
etc.
Eric
Nelson
has
given
me
superior
service
and
is
very
responsive.
He
is
a
top
notch
sales
person
and
customer
service
rep.
Unbelievably
good
deals
coupled
with
a
vast
collection.

The
discounts
and
offers
that
run
daily
add
excellent
opportunities
to
try
new
products
before
risking
larger
purchases.

Delivery
is
fast
and
prompt.

Not
enough
positive
words
for
this
wonderful
website!!!
Easy
to
use
the
website
and
easy
to
order
and
fast
delivery.
Very
happy
with
everything
We
were
quite
happy
with
Viator's
offerings.
The
only
issues
we
had
were
that
because
we
were
staying
in
an
apartment
through
AirBnB
it
meant
that
we
actually
had
to
travel
to
get
to
Viator's
limited
pickup
zones,
so
basically
any
savings
we
made
going
via
AirBnB
were
negated
by
the
taxi
ride
to
the
pickup
zones.
Also,
one
of
the
bus
trips
were
a
bit
clunky,
we
had
to
get
off
and
wait
for
a
second
mini
bus
to
get
to
San
Diego.
The
bus
took
a
lot
longer
than
expected,
but
the
driver
was
great
and
even
made
the
effort
to
locate
our
hostel.
These
were
just
a
couple
of
things
of
note,
but
overall
it
was
a
great
service
which
I
hope
to
use
once
again
on
my
upcoming
trips.
I'd
really
like
you
to
use
Mazuma
-
you
won't
believe
how
fast
they
are!
The
process
is
so
swift,
you
bearly
have
time
to
let
the
battery
cool
in
your
old
mobile
before
it
is
in
a
bag
and
with
Mazuma
and
then
you
are
paid!

I
was

it
was
exactly
as

I
was
not
happy
with
the
tank
that
came
with
the
kit
due
to
the
air
hole
being
on
the

I

continue

(and
inform
the

and
offer

I

a

quickly
for

trip
to
China.
My
passport
expired
about
a
year
ago,
and
it
has
been
a
while
since
going
thur
the
process.
I
chose
RushMyPassport.com
as
the
title
and
website
indicated
that
this
should
solve
my
needs.
It
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations.
I
submitted
my
initial
request,
and
early
the
next
day
(even
on
a
Saturday),
a
case
manager,
Alex
Valdez,
called
me
to
walk
me
thru
the
process.
By
the
time
I
got
off

I
had
all

information
in

If
you

I
would

You

have
gone
thru
the
experience
to
give

Recently
I
have
switched
internet
provider
from
Singtel
to
ViewQwest.
I
encountered
frustrating
glitches
that
disrupted
my
viewing
of
videos
on
Hulu
and
contacted
ViewQwest
technical
support
team.
However,
I
am
very
happy
with
the
efforts
of
ViewQwest
in
rectifying
the
error
I
had
while
using
the
VPN
service.
To
my
pleasant
surprise,
the
support
team
was
very
responsive
and
provided
me
with
very
good
customer
service.
The
follow-up
was
good
and
eventually
the
problem
was
solved.
Compared
to
my
previos
provider,
the
service
here
is
leaps
and
bounds
better.
I
do
wish
though
that
the
VPN
service
works
smoother
and
streams
at
a
faster
speed
on
the
U.S
and
UK
sites.
As
of
now,
I'm
a
proud
subscriber
of

I
also
had
a
coupon
that
wasn't
applied

their
customer

got
right

and
fixed
everything.

problem
I
had
was
shipping.

the
products
got
here
the
50

bag
of

food

Had
to
get
extra
containers
to
store
it
all.

Probably
wasn't
PetFlow's
fault
but
they
should
have
a
talk
with
their

order

see
what
happens.

fit

well

had
no
trouble
getting
everything
I

I
would

were

feels
very
good
to
be
able
to
preserve
land
for
all
the
flora
and
fauna
in
a
spot
that
looks
so
beautiful.
Thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
be
a
part
of
this
project.
I've
used
Cult
pens
on
many
occasions
and
i
always
received
excellent
service
and
prompt
delivery
aswell
as
providing
me
with
a
vast
range
of
pens,pencils
etcthat
i
can'
t
purchase
on
the
high
street
I
was
pleased
with
how
quickly
the
parts
were
delivered
to
me.
Just
booked
car
parking
at
Manchester
over
easter
holiday
period
for
a
great
deal.
Everything
was
as
described.
Received
in
amount
of
time
given
at
checkout.
Excellent
people
to
deal
with.
I
received
a
really
nice
watch
from
Jacobtime,
at
a
great
price,
although
I
was
disappointed
my
first
choice
wasn't
in
stock,
but
not
indicated
on
the
website.
Received
fast
but
haven't
used
it
yet.
Quality
products
fair
play,feeling
and
seeing
the
gains
using
TPW!And
I
always
get
email
alerts
on
offers
and
discounts
on
a
weekly
basis!
I
really
enjoy
using
'my
protein'
products!!I
only
use
them
when
the
half
price
bundles
come
on
offer!!For
what
you
get
is
fantastic
for
your
money!Its
just
a
shame
they
don't
do
the
bundles
more
often
I
couldn't
believe
how
easy
the
site
was
to
use.
Beginning
to
end
took
a
couple
of
minutes
and
was
very
straightforward.
Now
I
just
have
to
hope
I
don't
need
to
make
a
claim.
The
website
works
well,
and
the
prompt
response
from
the
staff
at
LFH
made
it
a
pleasure
to
deal
with
them.
Quality
of
packaging
and
instructions
made
delivery
and
return
painless.
The
goods
I
ordered
came
quickly
and,
when
I
found
out
that
I
had
ordered
the
wrong
thing,
they
phoned
in
response
to
my
e-mail
and
exchanged
them
for
the
correct
item
within
24
hours.
Excellent!
Excellent
service,
but
I
only
seemed
to
be
able
to
book
two
Italian
train
journeys
at
once...or
maybe
out
was
a
faulty
internet
connection.
A
very
good
value
for
money
product
delivered
within
a
reasonable
timescale,
and
two

Sweets
included
in
the
box!
Neatly
packaged
and
very
good
service.
Pete
King
installed
our
alarm
system.
He
was
really
friendly
and
efficient.
He
had
a
fun
sense
of
humor
and
was
very
helpful
in
educating
us
about
the
system.

Yesterday
an
hvac
came
to
the
house
and
our
dog
almost
tried
to
kill
him,
but
Pete
had
the
dog
at
ease
the
whole
time.

I
trust
her
opinion
of
strangers
above
my
own
sometimes.
He
is
clearly
a
good
guy
and
a
pro
at
his
job.
When
Cult
Pens
first
appeared
on
my
Internet
radar
I
was
amazed.
For
months
I
would
salivate
over
their
extensive
range
of
calligraphic
joy,
in
itself
a
pleasure
of
ink-based
browsing.
Lurking
like
some
kind
of
stalker,
it
was
with
careful
planning
that
I
'came
in'
for
my
first
transaction,
the
purchase
of
an
artefact
of
pure
beauty
-
the
Lamy
Al-Star.
I
ordered
requisite
ink
supplies,
ticked
the
box
for
the
free
Lamy
ballpoint,
and
all
dropped
through
my
mailbox
exquisitely
packed
and
perfectly
accounted
for
within
48
hours
of
me
tapping
on
glass
on
an
iPad.
Come
to
Cult
Pens.
They
are
Cultish.
They
do
pens.
You
should
joint
the
cult.
Use
Cult
Pens.
They
are
the
best.
Cheers.
Got
a
lot
of
gifts
from
here
for
my
birthday

Should
buy

from
here

it

to

I

WHEN

WITH
LOTS
OF

I
I
WAS
VERY
IMPRESSED
ordered
my
supplies
from
them
and
they
arrived
in
a
couple
of
days
really
pleased
with
them
I
found
this
site
by
chance,and
I'm
really
please
I
did.
I've
been
fascinated
with
pens
for
40
years
and
its
great
to
have
found
a
website
with
such
a
great
selection
including
some
great
special
offers
and
limited
editions
i.e.
a
recent

Warhol
collection.
I
have
no
doubt
ill
be
checking
out
'Cult
Pens'
again
very
soon.
My
buddy
referred
me
to
Supplementwarehouse.com
about
2
years
ago
and
it
has
remained
a
constant
source
of
muscle
building
power
for
me
since.

I,
too,
have
been
a
customer
of
GNC
for
many
years.

I
still
go
there,
in
case,
I
need
to
re-up
at
the
snap
of
the
finger,
but
supplementwarehouse
blows
GNC
out
of
the
water
in
comparison.

The
retail
prices
are
nearly
cut
in
half,
if
not
more,
and
I
usually
get
everything
within
a
couple
days.

The
shipping
costs
are
always
an
eyesore
but
overall,
this
site
is
the
best
around.
You
need
to
check
out
Selfstorage
for
your

storage
needs!
They
are
reasonably
priced,
clean,
and
well
kept
.
The
manager
is
informed,
friendly,
helpful
and
efficient
.
Fantastic
prices,
fast
shipping,
product
exactly
as
described,
can't
ask
for
anything
more!!!
Ordered
some
Christmas
gifts
as
I
do
every
year.
Delivery
was
fast
within
2
days,
which
helped
as
I
had
ordered
a
little
late.
I
received
my
order
on
the
24th,
just
in
time
for
Christmas.
Reliable
as
ever.

I
book
a
hostel
in
Chengdu
from
Hostelworld
website,
and
that
was
a
nice
experience.
The
whole
buying
experience
was
good
and
beyond
my
expectations.
Confirmation
of
order
and
regular
order
progress
updates
were
received
at
regualar
intervals.
Delivery
was
very
prompt
(earlier
than
estimated).
The
product
could
not
be
found
cheaper
on
any
website
other
than
an
auction
site
where
it
was
on
offer
for
the
same
price
secondhand
plus
postage.
Why
buy
secondhand
when
you
can
buy
new
at
the
same
price
with
a
guarantee?
Product
is
excellent
as
was
the
buying
experience.
Happy
to
recommend
this
trader.
Excellent
range
of
products
which
made
it
difficult
to
choose
just
one.
We
went
for
the
toadstools
feature
and
purchased
online.
It
was
a
very
easy
transaction,
no
problems
whatsoever.
The
purchased
was
immediately
confirmed
and
a
delivery
day/date
was
given
for
the
next
working
day
(delivery
was
included
within
the
purchase
price).
Delivery
was
by
a
reputable
courier
and
it
was
delivered
the
next
day.
The
item
was
very
well
packaged
and
the
actual
water
feature
was
pleasantly
beyond
our
expectations.
We
followed
the
enclosed
(and
simple
!)
instructions
and
was
up
and
literally
running
within
10
minutes.
The
water
feature
looks
great
in
our
back
garden,
so
much
so
we
are
considering
another
one
to
match
it.
This
is
how
all
purchases
should
be,
no
problems,
easy
transactions,
delivery
as
promised
and
top
quality
products.
I
would
definately
recommend

they
have
set
the

wish
all

would
be

as

in
appreciating
the
customer.

The
ease
of

what
I
was

for
was
great,
the
prices
were
better,
but
the
best
part
was
the
price

I
couldn't

it!
I
will
definitly
be
recommending
this
to
my
friends!
Amazing
selection.
Fast
delivery.
Great
price.
Excellent
company.
After
i
purchased
my
items
they
despatched
them
that
same
day,
despite
one
of
the
items
being
an
extremely
large
one.
It
was
delivered
the
next
day
and
full
tracking
info
was
provided.
When
i
e-mailed
to
let
them
know
that
i'd
got
the
item
they
replied
very
quickly.
Their
reply
was
personal
and
gracious,
showing
a
real
human
side
which
few
big
music
retailers
have.

I
ordered
a
set
of
winter
tyres
for
my
daughter's
Clio-
the
choice
on
the
Black
Cirlces
website
was
good
and
the
fitting
was
carried
out
very
efficiently
-
I'd
definately
use
the
service
again.
I
recently
bought
the
Barbour
Bristol
jacket
from
country
attire.
The
main
attraction
for
purchasing
it
from
this
site
was
the
free
hood.
Barbour
jackets
are
the
same
price
everywhere
you
look
but
the
option
of
a
free
hood
which
usually
costs
about
£30
was
very
nice.
Also
the
free
next
day
recorded
delivery
was
very
good
as
well.
I
would
definitely
buy
from
this
site
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
We
are
very
pleased
with
the
service
and
the
way
way
we
were
treated.
This
is

third
visit
at
the

to

As
I
said
in
the
title,
I
had
a
problem
in
that
the
Cross
Trainer
was
damaged,
I
immediately
phoned
and
was
told
to
continue
unpacking
and
send
photographs
of
any
damage.
In
total
I
found
4
seperate
pieces
of
damage.
When
I
phoned
I
spoke
to
a
very
helpfull
Lady
and

was
offered
either
parts
sent
out
or
a
swap.
I
opted
for
the
swap
and
was
told
to
confirm
via
an
E-Mail
they
would
send
me,
a
date
for
the
swap.
10
minutes
after
putting
the
phone
down
I
had
confirmed
and
the
cross
trainer
was
swapped
the
very
next
day
by
a
very
polite
driver.
I
am
happy
with
my
cross
trainer
and
appreciate
that
things
do
get
damaged
in
transit
however
it
was
quite
clear
that
my
original
cross
trainer
had
been
opened
and
the
damage
to
the
outside
of
the
box
was
quite
severe,
I
could
only
ask
for
maybe
better
checks
before
dispatch.
I
recomend!
It's
fantastic!
Nice

found

plus
the

this
an
excellent
choice.
All
my

arrived
exactly

and

were

from

again.

This
caused

a

I'm
really

can't

good
things
about

What
people
do
not
know
is
that
even
though
a
flight
may
have
100
empty
seats,
Travelocity
will
lead
you
to
believe
there
are
no
two
seats
together,
so
if
you
want
to
sit
next
to
your
mate,
you
have
to
pay
a
premium
for
the
seating,
only
to
get
on
the
plane
and
find
out
it
is
empty.

This
happened
to
me
coming
and
going
on
a
recent
flight.

Seating
was
assigned
through
travelocity,
but
they
showed
the
plane
nearly
full
so
I
put
out
the
cash
to
book
that
last
remaining
seats
together.

The
plane
was
actually
so
empty,
staff
advised
the
passengers
they
could
sit
anywhere.

This

before
you

Transaction
went
well.
What
more
is
there
to
say?
I
ordered
what
I
consider
to
be
an
expensive,
for
me,
camera
accessory.

I
looked
numerous
other
places
(on-line
and
off)
for
this
particular
item
and
found
DigitalRev
to
be
the
best
price
and
included
"free
shipping
(always
a
plus
for
me).
After
placing
the
order,
I
noticed
that
my
order
was
being
processed
and
was
on
its
way
within
the
not-quite-promised
24
hour
period.

I
received
the
order
packed
within
a
very,very
tough
plastic
bag,
and
my
accessories
wrapped
inside
enough
protective
material
to
protect
the
most
delicate
of
contents.

As
I
hoped,
my
camera
accessories
came
out
of
the
shipping
bag
as
if
it
was
handed
to
me
by
a
white-gloved
specialist.

and
the

After

was
refused
the
first
time
I
tried
to
get
a
non

number
to
call
and
talk
to
them,
I
sent
4
emails
and
they
never
gave
me
a

Finally
my
purchase
was
refused
supposedly
because
they
do
not

I
WAS

staff
called
me
and
emailed
the
ring
before
they
ship
which
was
great
because
I
could
have
chosen
the
wrong
ring
and
they
showed
me
a
better
one
which
I
got.
Great
service
all
around.
I
like
the
idea
of
making
my
own
card
and
able
to
personalize
the
card.
The
cost
of
the
card
was
reasonable.
I
ordered
2
sets
of
plectrums
(14
in
total)
for
which
I
was
charged
2
delivery
charges.
One
for
each
set.
The
plectrums
would
have
fitted
into
a
small
jiffy
bag,
instead
they
were
dispatched
as
one
order
in
a
small
bag
inside
a
box
approximatly
12
inches
square
which
had
then
been
filled
with
packing.
The
team
at
Africa
Odyssey
helped
us
arrange
an
incredible
safari
and
beach
adventure
in
Tanzania
for
our
honeymoon.

This
was
our
first
trip
to
East
Africa,
and
coming
from
the
U.S.
we
were
a
little
cautious
booking
with
an
overseas
travel
agency.

After
speaking
to
a
number
of
providers,
Africa
Odyssey
stood
out
for
its
depth
of
knowledge
in
Tanzania
and
its
great
customer
service.

Tom
worked
patiently
to
educate
us
on
our
options.

He
listened
to
our
preferences
/
concerns
and
then
provided
excellent
recommendations.

As
we
worked
to
finalize
our
itinerary,
Tom
made
sure
that
we
had
all
of
the
details
that
we
could
possibly
need
to
make
an
informed
decision.
90%

meanin

of

im
looking
for

Never

My
experienc
with
pure
health
was
overall
pleasant,
but
when
called
the
phone

provided
no

and
the
shipping
took
20
days.
I've
bought
from
B&H
many
times
over
the
years.
Prices
and
selection
are
very
good
with
prompt
shipping.
Never
needed
customer
service
so
I
can't
vouch
for
that.
No
worries
buying
here.
Time

When
I
need
a

here

They
are
who
I
use.
Superb
service
from
Merlin
Cycles.
Used
several
times
over
the
past
month
and
each
transaction
has
been
faultless
with
super
fast
delivery.
Most
importantly
for
me
these
guys
use
the
Royal
Mail
for
their
deliveries
which
is
most
important
as
we
both
work
full
time
and
are
never
here
to
receive
the
parcels.
The
RM
service
allows
collection
from
the
local
post
office
rather
than
travelling
many
miles
to
collect
from
other
couriers.
Keep
it
up
guys!
Love
dealing
with
this
company.
They'll
stand
by
their
products
and
assist
you
with
any
issues.
Don't
know
why
I
waited
so
long
to
use
this
service,
schlepping
clubs
around
is
a
real
pain.
Door
to
door
service
is
the
way
to
go!

Can't
wait
for
my
next
trip!
Hi
...just
want
to
tell
you
about
vet
medic
which
i
used
the
other
day
...i
would
highly
recommend
them
....good
service
and
delivery
and
would
gladly
use
them
again
.
Excellent
process
and
easiest
for
multiple
car
bookings
-
Will
be
back.
Absolutely
unacceptable
experience
Fast
and
efficient
I
can't
fault
delivery
arrangements.I
coud
not
get
my
first
choice
of
items
as
they
were
out
of
stock
otherwise
a
good
shopping
exerience
Purchased
fog
lamps
for
2010
Town
and
Country
which
seem
to
be
extremely
hard
to
find.

These
appear
to
be
of
equal
quality
to
the
originals

but
I
just
installed
the
part
so
don't
have
an
opinion
on
longevity.

It
would
have
helped
immensely
if
they
would
have
included
an
install
instruction
sheet
with
them
as
it
is
readily
apparent
how
to
get
the
old
lamps
out
and
the
new
ones
installed.

Otherewise
it
has
been
a
great
experience.
Easy
to
order.
Shipped
fast.
All
the
items
ordered
were
there.
Prices
are
a
little
high,
but
they
had
a
part
that
I
couldn't
find
elsewhere.
Great
price
and
great
quality
parts.

Shipping
was
fast.

I
would
definitely
recommend
this
site
for
parts.
parts
are
good
,but
when
you
need
to
get
answers
about
parts
you
buy,it
takes
24-48
hrs
buy
email.
They
need
a
phone
number.
It's
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
when
you
can
speak
to
person
who
is
so
well
informed
about
his
job
and
is
willing
to
help
you
beyond
your
needs.Thanks
James!!!!

After
placing
an
order
on
a
Tuesday
afternoon,
my
order
arrived
by
special
delivery
Great
Place.Great
Location.
Great
Staff
:D
The
have
an
excellent
fish
oil
product
that
is
reasonably
priced.
I
was
given
a
20
%
first
time
order
discount
with
no
hassles.
I
will
order
from
them
again
when
my
product
runs
out.
Super
reliable,
Items
arrived
ahead
of
schedule.
I
have
recommended
eeuroparts
to
everyone
I
know
that
has
a
SAAB,
BMW
and
MINI.
Plenty
of
choice
in
products
and
flavours
that
are
different
to
to
all
others.
This
company
has
everything
you
could
need...if
they
don't
have
it,
you
don't
need
it!

The
staff
is
very
knowledgeable
and
friendly.

I
often
compare
prices
against
Amazon
and
theirs
are
always
competitive.

Great
company
to
do
business
with.
Excellent
service
and
communications.
Easy
to
deal
with
and
delivered
when
they
said
they
would.
I
got
what
I
wanted
on
time
Goods
arrived
quickly
with
no
problems
albeit
that
the
trunks
are
very
much
on
the
small
side.

I
trust
that
I
won't
have
any
problems
exchanging
them!
Having
struggled
to
get
the
chicken
worming
powder
from
my
local
pharmacy,
I
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
get
it
delivered
so
quickly
and
at
no
extra
cost.

You
should
definitely
consider
this
service.
I
ordered
a
reading
glasses
suppose
to
be
made
in
Italy
...
And
you
sent
me
made
in
china...$159.000
made
in
china?
They
were
great,
I
placed
the
order,
i
received
confirmation
in
an
email
very
shortly
there
after,
they
kept
me
posted
of
the
delivery
and
where
the
package
was
and
to
my
surprise,
I
had
the
parts
days
before
I
expected.....it
was
great
from
start
to
finish!
Good
and
fast
service
thank
you
The
door
handle
was
broken
on
my
wifes
Ford
Fusion.
Expecting
it
to
be
a
costly
repair,
we
limped
along
until
I
found
PartsGeek.com.
They
had
what
I
needed
to
make
the
repair
at
a
very
reasonable
price.
The
part
safely
arrived
as
promissed
and
on
a
cold
morning,
I
was
able
to
easily
install
it
saving
$$.
Now
I
know
where
to
get
replacement
parts
for
our
vehicles
to
do
some
repairs
myself.
For
starters
the
staff
was
incredibly
friendly
and
felt
like
i
was
family,
the
contract
was
month
to
month
with
one
month
free,
the
location
was
perfect
and
i
had
choices
of
my
unit
location.
I
couldnt
ask
for
more
except
for
them
to
move
all
my
stuff
for
me.
I
didnt
ask
but
now
i
guess
ill
never
know.
LOL.
Simple,
efficient
and
good
value.
I've
used
e-spares
several
times
so
when
the
washing
machine
door
mechanism
broke
I
knew
where
to
find
the
part
and
be
shown
how
to
fit
it.
What
could
be
simpler?
E-spares
are
top
notch.
I
went
for
the
next
day
postage
as
my
lovely
wife
couldn't
be
without
the
Machine
for
more
than
a
day
and
it
arrived
as
promised.
I'm
usually
very
on
the
ball
at
seeking
reviews
before
placing
orders
especially
for
expensive
items.
What
was
I
thinking
of
on
this
occasion?
I
guess
I
was
taken
in
by
their
web
site
stating
item
was
available.
I
didn't
realise
it
was
to
be
imported.
Although
I
placed
order
in
good
time
for
Christmas
it
didn't
arrive
as
date
got
nearer.
Got
in
touch
as
was
told
stock
was
an
issue.
I
decided
to
cancel
order
as
no
date
could
be
given.
I'm
still
trying
to
get
a
refund
a
month
later.
I'm
now
passing
over
to
my
bank
to
pursue
under
the
credit
act.
So
wish
I'd
reviewed
company
first
and
read
the
many,
many
reviews
of
from
those
that
have
had
similar
unhappy
experiences.
Please
avoid
Simply
Electronics.
They're
Simply
Appalling.
Correspondence
polite
but
worthless.
This
company
needs
investigating.
Very
competitive
prices
and
loads
of
choice.
Great
to
be
able
to
pick
a
time
to
suit
me.
When
the
fitter
arrived
he
was
quick,
polite
and
did
the
job
well.
I
would
have
given
five
stars
if
it
wasn't
for
the
fact
I
have
a
wheel
wobble
at
70mph.
I
didn't
have
this
before
so
must
put
it
down
to
wheel
balancing.
To
be
fair,
I
haven't
been
back
in
touch
as
I'm
certain
etyres
would
put
it
right
but
it
should
be
right
1st
time.
That
said,
I
would
use
again
and
recommend.
Bed
arrived
quickly
and
is
very
well
made.
Instructions
took
a
little
time
to
get
to
grips
with
but
once
you
get
going
its
not
too
difficult.
When
constructed
it
aint
going
nowhere!
When
looking
to
buy
I
thought
it
was
a
good
price
but
Time4Sleep
do
not
tell
you
VAT
has
to
be
added
then
the
delivery
charge
so
it
soon
mounts
up.
That
said,
I'm
still
pleased
with
the
bed
and
it
looks
great
in
the
room.
If
you
want
a
part
that
works
and
fits,
at
a
great
price,
this
is
the
place
to
buy
them...Period!

Quick
delivery
and
always
have
what
I
need.
Every
time
you
order
something
you
expect
that
it
happened
just
like
the
page
told
us
and
that's
exactly
what
happened.
Your
customer
service
folks
could
not
properly
handle
a
change
and
gave
me
confusing
answers.
Had
to
cancel
order
and
go
but
the
clubs
at
Dicks.
.
Nice
service.

I
had
to
make
a
pick
up
date
change
and
there
were
no
issues
with
my
changes.

Thanks,
I
will
use
the
service
again.
I
just
used
Parts
Geek
for
the
first
time
and
was
very
pleased.
everything
worked
will
I
loved
the
idea
of
the
stick
on
Whiteyboard.

I
spent
over
1
hour
working
with
another
person
to
install
the
4x6
product.

The
end
result
was
nothing
short
of
an
eye
sore
and
embarrassing.

As
we
attempted
to
make
adjustments
to
the
"removable"
white
board,
it
began
to
peel
paint
and
parts
of
the
wall
off
with
it.
The
ergonomics
of
the
install
make
it
almost
impossible
for
a
nonprofessional
to
hang.

The
finished
product
had
wrinkles
and
bubbles
and
looks
terrible.

I
would
not
recommend
the
product
to
anyone
that
I
actually
liked.
Great
idea,
impossible
install.
The
one-sentence
review
pretty
much
sums
it
up.

I
have
mentioned
your
website
to
a
close
friend
and
he
has
already
ordered
and
I
believe
received
products
from
Ingrms
Water
and
Air.

Thank
you
for
making
our
switch
from
our
previous
30-year-old
heating
system
and
25-year-old
AC
to
the
new
Goodman
brand
received
from
you.
Bought
something
online.
Didn't
fit
right
so
swapped
for
another
size
in
store.
Tried
to
then
return
to
store
and
refund
refused.
Contacted
CEO
twice
and
eventually
got
email
telling
me
how
sad
they
were
and
offering
refund.
Tried
to
now
progress
this
twice
but
still
no
response.
Absolutely
dreadful
I
recomend
Travelocity
for
its
value,
ease
of
reservation
system,
and
no
stress
I
recommand
you
tennis
nuts
because
:
The
women
in
our
office
are
great
to
work
with.
Whatever
you
ask
of
them
the
do
it
is
done
with
a
smile
and
very
quickly.
If
there's
an
issue
they
can't
resolve
the
find
the
person
who
can.
You
aren't
going
to
find
better
front
office
help
in
Dallas.
Really
trustful
seller.
Excellent
service
and
fast
shipping.
Entering
another
companies
website
and
their
price
to
get
5%
cheaper
seemed
too
good
to
be
true,
but
I
just
placed
an
order
without
any
hitches.

Thank
you
suuplementwarehouse.com,
I'll
be
back!
When
you
deal
with
papermart
you
can
expect:
I
would
normally
have
given
them
5
stars
as
they
have
always
been
a
first
class
company.
However
since
dropping
my
favourite
juice
that
I've
bought
for
years,
I'm
not
only
left
sobbing
in
my
own
self
pity
but
left
'med
high'
and
dry.
Fast
shipping
and
quality
juice.
Don't
need
to
say
anything
else.
First
class.......The
title
says
it
all.
We
were
served
by
Malcolm,
who
we
has
sold
us
equipment
before.

The
store
is
very
busy
and
being
Saturday
the
staff
were
under
a
lot
of
pressure.
I
was
looking
for
a
replacement
battery
pack
for
an
emergency
lighting
fitting
and
this
web
site
was
the
only
one
that
could
supply
it.

Furthermore
the
company
offered
to
send
me
the
remainder
of
the
order
whilst
the
battery
pack
was
on
order,
this
arrived
the
very
next
day.
What
I
needed,
when
I
needed
it.
The
prices
are
great,
if
you
can
get
the
correct
part.

I
gave
them
the
correct

Ford
Motor
Company
part
number,
and
they
still
sent
the
wrong
parts.

Their
website
is
dumb.

The
grill
for
the
fog
lights
is
reversed--they
list
the
one
for
the
right
side
as
left,
and
vise-versa.



I
sent
them
a
picture
of
the
car,
and
they
still
could
not
get
it
right.
I'm
not
only
sleeping
better
but
I
wake
up
without
the
sore
neck.

I
recommend
these
pillows
to
all
my
USA
Martial
Arts
students
because
I
use
them
and
believe
in
what
the
company
represents.


Great
for
anyone
wanting
more
comfortable
and
restful
sleep.

Try
a
pillow,
you'll
love
it!
I
am
a
repeat
customer.

My
purchases
have
been
processed
and
mailed
promptly;
items
are
more
than
satisfactory.

Prices
are
reasonable.


I
have
contacted
West
Coast
Shaving
on
tow
occasions.

Received
prompt
and
friendly
responses.


I
recommend
them.
Had
everything
I
wanted
and
could
find
it
quickly.

Great
prices
and
I
know
the
quality
is
solid!

Thanks!
I
have
been
a
customer
for
several
years,
The
reason
I
continue
with
Doheny's
Supplies
are
simple.
The
cost
is
either
equal
or
lower
than
anyone
else
,
I
know
when
I
order
something
either
parts
or
supplies
for
my
pool,
I
know
it
will
be
shipped
fast
and
I
get
it
in
a
few
days.
If
I
call,
I
speak
to
a
friendly
person
on
the
phone
and
willing
to
help
me.
If
you
want
top
notch
customer
service
contact
Sarina
Stacy
at
4WD!

Not
only
will
she
square
your
requirement
away,
she'll
check
back
to
make
sure
you're
completely
satisfied.
Good
To
GO!
Waist
of
time,
should
of
just
sold
it
on
eBay!!
Well
the
only
thing
good
about
this
company
so
far
was
there
fast
service
getting
the
part
to
me.
YES!
The
wrong
part
and
they
have
no
way
to
get
hold
of
them
only
to
fill
out
a
slip
which
they
say
they
will
get
back
to
you.
There
1-800
free
number
gives
you
three
choices,
but
a
voice
comes
on
saying
there
phone
calls
are
so
full
they
can't
get
back
to
you.
If
you
call
there
regular
number
some
guy
named
Buster
answers
saying
he
is
away
from
his
desk
to
leave
message,
but
then
you
find
out
that
his
message
service
is
full,
so
I
went
to
my
bank
and
we
are
doing
this
the
legal
way,
and
they
have
so
many
days
to
get
my
refund
to
me
or
have
legal
actions
take
agaisnt
them.
If
you
go
online
and
read
the
reviews
about
this
company
there
is
no
good
reviews
in
there
favor,
so
until
I
get
my
refund
from
them
this
company
SUCKS!
I
have
used
them
three
times
to

with
winter
drawing
on
and
cold
dark
nights
here
for
a
while,
we
have
a
cosy
glow
around
the
house
with
the
flickering
flame
lamps
and
t-light
candles
that
we
recently
bought
from
Festive
Lights
on
line.
They
really
are
nice
and
we've
got
all
the
benefits
of
a
natural
flame
with
totally
safe
LED
lighting.
the
lamp
also
features
a
silk
flickering
piece
of
gauze
around
the
light
which
makes
it
look
incredibly
realistic.
The
fitter
turned
out
on
a
wet
and
cold
morning
but
he
was
cheerful
and
quickly
fitted
my
two
new
tyres
without
any
problems.
I
called
the
dealer
on
my
sons
mustang
gt
about
parts.
I
needed
the
translation
of
a
house
sale
document
and
I
needed
it
quickly.
I
submitted
it
online
and
got
it
the
very
next
day!
Fantastic.
Fast,
and
accurate
and
a
fair
price.
Have
had
only
one
transaction
so
far
but
was
quite
impressed
with
the
customer
service.

I
would
not
hesitate,
and
plan
on
doing
business
again
with
them.
No
problem
with
Blackcircles
but
the
garage
used
to
fit
they
tyres
was
not
great.


Had
an
appointment
for
9.30
on
the
saturday
which
suited
me.
I
was
phoned
by
Blackcircles
on
the
Friday
to
ask
if
I
could
have
the
car
at
the
garage
for
8
oclock
on
the
saturday
which
i
agreed
to.
I
assumed
that
by
making
the
effort
to
have
the
car
in
so
early
i
would
not
have
to
wait
long.
I
was
asked
to
come
back
in
2
hours.
2
hours
to
change
2
tyres
seems
a
long
time
to
me.
Happy
with
they
tyres,
not
happy
with
the
service!
I
have
had
very
good
service
from
this
company
regarding
price
and
delivery
.
I
am
satisfied
with
all
the
dealings
i
have
had
with
them
and
would
recommend
them
to
anyone.
Quick
delivery
of
the
product.
I
certainly
use
this
company
again.
I
searched
many
sites
before
coming
across
Parts
Geek.
They
had
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for
at
prices
that
blew
away
the
competition.
Delivery
was
fast.
I
highly
recommend
Parts
Geek
to
anyone
looking
for
auto
parts
online.
Save
money
and
time.
they
always
have
what
we
need
at
a
good

If
there
is
one
thing
I
can
add
its
that
when
you
select
a
color
on
your
site,
in
addition
to
having
the
color
change,

have
the
name
of
the
color
pop
up
to.
I
ordered
what
I
thought
was
orange
and
got
gold.
It
didn't
state

drying
the

but
it
did
say
it
after
I
checked
out.
I
probably
would
have
selected
a
different

All
in

I
love

re:
My
first
experience
with
Rev
was
fantastic.

While
they
guarantee
turnaround
to
be
within
48
hours
it
was
much
quicker
than
that
and
highly
accurate.
I
immediately
sent
them
two
more
jobs
and
downloaded
the
app
for
my
phone.
It
seems
will
we
are
off
to
a
nice
partnership.
The
price
was
very
competitive
--
close
to
the
best
I
could
find.
They
had
what
I
wanted
and
shipped
it
immediately.
Best
price
I
could
find
by
far.
Shipping
was

slower

I
was
so

and
impressed
by

had
used

This

I

told

certainly
before

Well
at
6:30
pm
or
so
on

(Tuesday)
I
had

Very

I

I

placed

because
I
needed
further
information.The

I
spoke
to
was
very
helpful
and
efficient
.
Highly

I
have
ordered
from
Coolshop
a
few
times
now
and
most
of
the
time
they
have
the
cheapest
deals
on
new

but
not
only
that,
they
are
reliable
too!
Games
have
always
been
delivered
on

and
any

sent
well
in

Can't

them

Received

Will

I
saved
fifty
bucks
buying
from
Parts
Geek.
I
also
ordered
the
wrong
part
and
returning
it
was
a
breeze.
Quick
response
to
my
emails.
Pretty
satisfactory.

I
wish
I
didn`t
have
to
choose
between
Irish
Ferries
and
Stenaline
at
the
outset.

I
would
prefer
just
to
choose
the
route
and
decide
on
the
ferry
company
when
I
was
presented
with
price
and
choice
of
sailings.
Everything
ordered
arrived
promptly.
After
seeing
the
excellent
prices
on
the
site
I
made
an
order
at
10.00
on
a
Thursday
morning.
Product
was
delivered
the
next
day
at
midday.
Not
only
was
postage
and
packing
free
but
I
also
received
a
free
Reflex
mixer
cup
too.
Told
my
colleague
straight
away
who
also
put
in
an
order
for
2
tubs
of
Reflex
protein
powder.
Will
be
telling
more
friends
and
using
you
myself
again!

Thank
you.
I
ordered
a
side
mirror
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
from
the
dealership
and
it
was
excellent.
It
is
immaculate
and
was
ready
to
paint.
I
was
very
pleased
with
how
well
it
was
packed
in
the
box
and
how
well
of
a
factory
match
it
was.
I'm
very
happy
and
after
having
it
painted,
its
a
perfect
match.
Thanks
so
much
for
saving
me
$150
and
the
price
was

Good
service
and
good

Pretty
good
service,
only
slight
negative
would
be
the
fluctuating

in
the
sale.
A
day
later
and
I
may
had
chosen
a
different
one.
But
I
guess
that's
sales
and
you
just
roll
the
dice...
I
may
even
buy
another,
check
me
out.
Always
the

We
would
have
been
completely
satisfied
but
we
were
sent
the
wrong
color!!

We
really
need
to
get
this
fixed
ASAP
and
getting
the
wrong
color
was
a
disappointment;
however
if
the
right
color
was
sent
we
would
have
rated
it
a
10!!!
what
a
good
experience!everything
was
organised
and
we
had
no
problems
whatsoever
.It
was
so
easy
to
drop

off

Every

in

didn't
believe
that
'Mega
Cab'
would
make
a
differance
on
the
part
until
I
proved
them
wrong.

After
searching
high
and
low
the
only
place
that
carried
this
part
was
StockWiseAuto.

They
also
had
the
part
listed
cheaper
than
any
of
the
other
parts
that
the
local
stores
were
trying
to
get
me
to
purcase.

After
ordering
the
part
I
was
given
an
expected
arrival
date
and
it
arrived
that
morning
and
was
on
my
truck
within
the
hour.

to
my
door.

It
was
ideal
since
I
was
in
a
time
crunch,
but
I'll
use
it
in
the
future
just
to
save
the
hassle
of
extra
liquor
store
trips.

Plus,
I'm
able
to
get
harder
to
find
items.

LOVE
this
company/service!!

Look
forward
to
seeing
what's
next
from
them!
UPDATE:
OK
so
after
holding
for
another
hour...
finally
got
this
very
nice
man
in
india
who
spoke
great
english..
negotiated
to
give
me
a
credit
80%
of
my
costs
good
for
a
flight
anywhere
with
same
carrier,
a
cost
of
$200
change
plane
fee
to
pay
to
the
carrier...
so
I
rebooked
to
go
see
Grandpa.

Not
my
first
choice
but
at
least
they
tried.

This
took
way
to
long,
was
a
complete
hassle
when
through
5
people
to
finally
get
someone
to
help
me
but
...
cost
me
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
more
and
at
least
I
wasn't
totally
out
of
pocket
on
this
flight.
I
have
been
a
customer
of
Paypal,
Google
wallet
and
many
other
systems
over
the
years
and
Square
Cash
is
the
simplest
way
for
someone
to
send
money
to
another
person
period.
It
was
very
easy!
Outstanding!
Great
selection,
great
prices,
and
super
fast
shipping!
I
will
be
back!
We
never
check
any
other
agency
when
bookig
a
car
for
USA
No
problems
with
booking
site
great
prices
too!!!
As
a
customer
who
needs
to
speak
with
a
real
person
I
think
you
service
is
terrible.
I
have
tried
several
times
to
speak
to
a
sales
rep
and
I
never
get
to
a
live
person.
I
have
been
in
sales
for
over
30
years
and
i
can't
belive
how
diificult
it
is
to
communicate
with
your
firm.
From
the
time
I
contacted
them
to
placing
the
order
to
receiving
my
order,
iPromo
was
professional,
friendly,
and
prompt.
Arrived
at
Thrifty
to
pick
up
my
car
at
CHC
Airport
and
they
had
no
record
that
I
was
mean
to
have
a
free
GPS
with
my
car,
didn't
even
know
who
Bliss
was.
They
didn't
even
offer
to
check,
I
had
to
use
my
phone
to
show
them
the
website
and
where
it
said
the
car
includes
a
free
GPS.
Then
the
GPS
they
eventually
gave
me
didn't
work,
Great
price.
Item
just
as
described.
Fast
shipping
Ordered
2
ASO
evo
braces
and
got
them
in
2
days.

I
needed
a
question
answered
and
when
I
emailed
mike
I
got
a
quick
reply....on
the
weekend.

Very
good
service.

I
have
played
with
regular
ASO
braces
for
years
and
this
was
my
first
try
using
the
evo.

They
seem
to
be
a
nice
upgrade.

More
comfortable
and
provide
a
bit
more
support
as
well.

Great
experience
with
this
company
and
product.
Bought
this
HOG
suit
at
Beneath
The
Sea
2013
show.
The
first
suit
was
a
little
small,
Mike
made
sure
that
the
size/
suit
got
taken
care
of.
The
replacement
suit
fits
GREAT,
works
GREAT,
looks
GREAT.
I
couldn't
be
more
pleased
with
DRIS
and
Mike.
He
must
enjoy
what
he
does
because
he
sure
is
good
at
it.﻿
Fort
the
right
part
info
a
quicktime'
the
goods
I
ordered
arrived
swiftly
I
was
worried
about
the
quality
of
the
part
when
I
saw
the
price
but
took
a
chance.

I
was
completely
satisfied.
Esse
site
é
demais,
além
do
bom
preço,
ainda
possui
ótimas
promoções
WCS'
website
is
easy
to
navigate.

Pricing
is
comparable
with
other
online
outlets
and
their
shipping
in
next
day.
What
more
can
I
ask
for.
Parts
delivered
,happy
with
cost
and
speed
of
shipment.
I
have
ordered
from
B&H
both
online
and
have
been
to
their
store
in
NYC.

I
trust
them
and
have
no
hesitations
when
purchasing
from
them.
when
i
bought
my
part
online
from
partsgeek
i
got
good
service
the
part
was
right
and
cheaper
then
buying
here
,
i
would
buy
there
again
I
could
not
be
happier
with
my
experience
with
Freight
Pros.

They
are
very
reliable,
friendly
and
easy
to
deal
with.

Not
only
that,
they
had
some
of
the
best
prices
out
there.



I
had
a
great
experience
with
Freight
Pro's
and
would
highly
recommend
them.
Their
website
was
very
easy
to
navigate,
offered
lots
of
selection
&
had
fair
prices.

Also
fun
to
get
freebies
with
our
order.
Stumbled
on
that's
site
and
it
was
super
helpful
navigating
to
our
needs.
they
send
me
the
same
part
wice.
I
did
ordered
right
and
left
tie
rod
and
I
got
two
left
and
NO
ONE
HAS
CONTACT
ME
YET,
I'M
NOT
HAPPY.
FROM
1
TO
10
MY
RATE
IS
The
difference
in
price
between
Auto
Europe
and
what
one
can
get
by
going
directly
to
the
potential
car
rental
companies
is
huge.
I
don't
really
know
why
one
would
ever
not
use
Auto
Europe.
I
haven't
found
a
disadvantage
yet,
at
least
not
for
our
needs,
which
is
a
mid-sized
car
for
a
month
or
more
in
Italy.
Good
service
but,
item
on
website
not
advertised
as
out
of
stock.
good
experience
i
would
tell
a
friend
no
doubt...
Great
new
golf
trolly
easy
to
assemble
easy
to
use
.
Very
happy
with
the
Go-Kart
purchased,
not
only
a
very
speedy
delivery
but
wrapped
completely
in
black
plastic
so
no
pictures
showing
or
text
to
give
the
surprise
away,
plus
keeps
the
box
totally
dry
in
this
wet
weather.
Thank
you
very
much.
Very
easy
website
to
use
also
with
loads
of
info
&
pictures.
Very
happy
customer.
As
a
plumber,
i
can't
believe
the
price
of
this
rad
as
any
were
els
it
would
be
at
least
double
the
cost
and
free
delivery
wow...............
came

2

and
badge

and
as
described
they
arrived
2
days
later
.............
nice
one
....
well
pleased
This
is
a
really
cool
gift
idea
that
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend.

It's
easy
to
step
through
the
process
and
the
cards
are
excellent.

I
have
recommended
this
to
many
of
my
friends
and
have
made
several
gift
card
purchases
myself!
I
ordered
a
Vespa
Split
Seat
GTV
leather
seat
and
paid
with
Paypal.

I
was
apprehenisve
about
buying
from
Germany.

But
the
price,
brought
me
here
to
Scooter
Center.

The
seat
was
$
414
US
compared
to
$529
from
the
UK
or
$690
locally
at
the
Vespa
store.


They
sent
me
an
updated
invoice
with
the
US
shipping
fee
added
and
cancelled
the
original
Paypal
payment
that
did
not
include
the
shipping.

So,
it
all
went
smoothly
with
emails
translated
for
me
to
English
from
German.

I
was
surprised
that
it
went
out
the
very
same
day
on
DHL.

Since
it
was
such
a
large
item,
it
took
24
days
for
it
to
arrive
from
Germany.

Arrived
pristine
and
perfect.
I
never
felt
so
pleased
on
buying
a
car
they
actually
treated
me
with
respect
even
with
my
bad
credit
I've
purchased
Squaretrade
warranties
for
the
last
three
or
four
years
based
on
positive
reviews
and
recommendations,
but
I'd
never
actually
had
to
file
a
claim.
Well
in
the
last
6
weeks
or
so
I've
had
to
file
two
different
claims
(one
on
a
dropped
tablet,
one
for
a
failing
laptop
battery)
and
both
of
those
experiences
could
not
have
gone
more
smoothly.
They
give
you
all
kinds
of
options
for
repairs/resolution,
and
their
phone
support
during
the
process
is
amazing.
I
know
for
a
fact
that
I
will
continue
to
use
Squaretrade
in
the
future
-
I
just
bought
two
new
warranties
this
week.
I
used
Reservation
Counter
for
the
Double
Tree
Hotel
in
Flagstaff
in
March
2014.

I
got
two
rooms
for
a
great
price.

There
was
no
problem
with
the
reservation,
and
the
hotel
rooms
were
excellent.


When
I
made
the
reservation,
it
was
clear
to
me
that
my
credit
card
would
be
billed
immediately
and
that
the
charges
were
non-refundable.


People
need
to
realize
that
non-refundable
does
not
have
any
exceptions.

This
is
a
risk
that
you
may
have
to
take
to
get
the
lowest
rates.

The
only
complaint
that
I
would
agree
with
to
some
degree
is
that
these
3rd
party
sites
may
give
you
the
impression
that
you
are
booking
directly
with
the
hotel.
Ordered
a
huge
umbrella
(68")
before
2pm
on
a
Friday,
and
it
arrived
within
24
hours!
I
waited
in
all
day
for
an
8:00
-
16:00
delivery
as
confirmed
by
Shakespere
(third
party
courier)
the
day
before.

Shakespere
also
promised
to
call
me
at
least
an
hour
before
delivery.
I've

The

I

was
exactly
as

on
the

the

time
was
a
matter
of
a
few
days.
I
had
a
cordless
phone
set
last
year
and
bought
a
ST
warranty
to
go
with
it.

recently,
it
started
dropping
out
for
10-20
seconds.

I
checked
everything,
but
kept
using
the
phone.

started
doing
it
more
often.

I
filed
a
claim
online
with
ST
and
as
soon
as
I
mailed
back
my
phone
I
got
paid
back
for
my
full
purchase
price.

amazing!!!!

We
are
long-time
Travelocity
customers,
and
recently
used
Travelocity
for
a
trip
to
Seattle.

I
made
the
airline
reservation
but
did
not
get
a
confirming
email.

I
had
to
go
to
my
credit
card
statement
to
get
the
ticket
number,
then
go
to
the
Alaska
Airlines
web
site
to
get
the
confirmation
code
so
that
I
could
check-in
on
their
web
site.

Also,
the
reservation
did
not
show
up
on
Travelocity
under
My
Itinerairies.

Except
for
the
credit
card
charge,
it
was
like
the
tickets
vanished.
I
have
ordered
various
medications
and
other
products
from
VetRxDirect
over
the
past
two
years
and
each
time
I
have
been
very
pleased
with
the
ordering
process
and
the
quick
delivery.
This
last
order
was
the
first
time
I
ever
spoke
with
someone
at
the
company.
They
called
me
the
day
after
I
placed
the
order
to
advise
they
were
having
a
difficulty
obtaining
verification
from
our
Vet
so
that
I
would
understand
if
there
was
a
delay.
I
guess
they
resolved
it
quickly
because
later
that
day
I
received
the
email
letting
me
know
my
order
was
shipped.

I
was
even
more
impressed.
Excellent
service
it
was
the
cheapest
product
online
could
not
fault
the
product

and
it
was
delivered
the
next
day
would
definately
use
again
Website
is
easy
to
navigate
and
very
responsive.
There
is
no
obligation
and
selling
agents
are
not
pushy.
Results
in
real
time
that
resulted
in
same
day
contract
execution
of
a
storage
unit.
I
was
looking
to
transfer
a
little
money
to
France,
and
was
getting
quoted
£25
from
my
bank
and
£27
from
Western
Union,
so
found
this
company
online
and
did
it
all
from
home
for
only
a
£1
fee,
cant
recommend
highly
enough.
Looking
for
this
hard-to-find
Panasonic
lens,
(some
retailers
said
they
wouldn't
have
it
for
months)
Panasonic
sent
me
to
DigitalRev.
I
ordered
it
on
a
Sunday,
saved
over
$100
and
received
the
lens
on
Tuesday!

In
hand
from
Hong
Kong
in
2
days!!
Call
me
impressed.
I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
I
place
an
order
late
Wednesday
night
as
the
daughter
yells
at
me
the
ink
has
run
out.

By
Friday
my
order
has
arrived
and
order
has
been
restored
in
the
household.


Bloody
good
from
Perth
to
Adelaide.


Great
service
but
best
of
all
the
price!!!!
Well
up
to
expectations
Having
found
the
product
I
was
seeking
the
ordering
was
simple,
the
documentation
comprehensive
and
the
delivery
as
advised.
Will
use

again
I

Effiecent
service.
I
rang
them,
I
got
some
good
advice
about
products
and
availability,
I
then
placed
an
online
order,
I
had
a
confirmation
phone
call
within
minutes
to
confirm
an
item
and
I
had
delivery
the
next
day.
Quality
goods,
excellent
service
and
fantastic
customer
service.
100%
all
the
way
Easy
to
find
and
order
I
seldom
give
a
5
out
of
5
score
-
well,
NEVER!
Works
well,
second
time
I've
used
it.
Major
savings
involved,
in
fact,
those
folk
who
use
the
first
transfer
site
they
find
already
pay
far
too
much.
Comparing
it
to
other
sites
and
the
savings
are
dramatic.
One
quibble,
the
BIC
code
I
got
from
a
Spanish
bank
had
ten
characters
and
Transferwise's
window
only
allowed
for
eight,
a
phone
call
to
Transferwise
clarified
it;
ignore
the
last
two(XX).
It
would
be
handy
to
state
that
beside
BIC
widow.
Good
Selection,
Good
Prices,
Bad
information!!
I
cant

believe
how
easy
it
was
to
order,
or
how
quick
the
delivery.
Ordered

As

Top

Good
and

Used

I
found
the
best
price
for
the
Candiae

at
PetBest.com
-
no
tax
and
free
shipping.
Having
been
a
avid
customer
of
Parts
Geek
I
was
taken
aback
when
i
was
told
the
return
postage
was
on
me.
The
description
of
the
part
I
needed
was
ambiguous
at
best,
leading
to
the
wrong
model
being
ordered.
I
now
paid
postage
on
the
original
part,
the
replacement
part
and
the
return
part.
So
there
goes
the
savings
for
shopping
at
Parts
Geek.
I
spent
more
on
postages
in
total
than
the
parts
cost!
im
shocked
to
hear
anyone
say
anything

about

i

WILL
ORDER
AGAIN
VERY
PLEASED
I
love
this
site.
They
offer
great
deals
on
their
products.
I
highly
recommend
them
for
all
your
toner
needs.
From
what
I
see
everything
works
nicely,
but
you
NEED
to
provide
software
for
Mac's!
A
lot
of
people
have
them
and
just
offering

is
stupid.
Very

Love
the

Yes,
Awesome,

Fast

and
the

was
top

and
went
right
in.
Will
always
order
from
this
company!
I
have
been
using
ZipRecruiter
for
several
years
now.

They
consistently
are
our
best
source
for
finding
new
employees.
One
bit
of
advice
when
asking
for
help
to
get
to
where
ever
you
want
to
go
be
sure
to
tell
the
person
you
are
willing
to
walk
to
save
on
time.

If
you
do
not
tell
them
you
are
willing
to
walk
they
will
try
and
help
you
by
bus
travel
only
and
the
full
loop
takes
several
hours,
so
you
can
easily
shave
off
hours
by
simply
walking
a
street
over
to
catch
a
different
bus.
Every
product
has
great
prices
and
also
have
some
amazing
blowout
deals.
The
only
thing
that
bothered
me
was
the
expensive
shipping,
besides
for
that,
everything
was
solid!
would
buy
repeatedly
enjoyable
trip
and
absolutely
no
problems
at
the
airport,
everything
went
swell.
But
you
could
have
supplied
the
planes
with
more
liquid
beverages.
Ordering
was
easy
on
website...
I
found
the
prices
through
a
google
search
and
clicked
through
to
the
product
page.

The
discout
for
a
case
of
wine
was
much
appreciated.

Communication
with
Saratoga
was
excellent...
they
informed
me
when
the
order
was
received,
processed
and
shipped,
and
my
order
arrived
earlier
than
expected
via
Fedex.

Will
definitely
do
business
with
this
company
again
the
next
time
I
find
a
wine
I
love!
This
company
is
excellent
and
I
will
continue
to
purchase
in
the
future.
I
just
got
my
BO2
Steam
key.
Mind
you
I
live
in
the
United
States.
Now
at
first
i
had
some
troubles
getting
my
key
because
it
was
stuck
at
processing.
But
I
hopped
on
live
chat
and
my
issue
was
fixed
in
a
mere
10
minutes!
Now
if
I
had
to
say
one
thing
the
customer
service
is
absolutely
amazing
and
the
best!
But
don't
believe
those
reviews
that
say
negativly
on
the
site.
If
you
want
proof
of
my
my
success
email
me:
codymcleod@outlook.com
Received
all
parts
as
stated
in
their
sales
information.
All
was
as
expected.
Product
arrived
in

The
only
complaint
is
that
my
PL-259
connector
arrived
in
a
box
big
enough
to
hold
a
6
pack
of
beer!
Professional,
trustworthy,
and
an
easy
to
use
website
are
just
a
few
reasons
as
to
why
Snapcap
has
provided
the
opportunity
for
small
businesses
everywhere
to
hit
the
ground
running.

It's
refreshing
to
no
longer
have
to
seek
the
traditional
and
impersonal

big
bank
process,
and
instead
work
with
a
lender
that
specializes
and
understands
the
importance
of
small
business.
in
todays
market
time
is
everything
and
shopto.net
have
got
that
spot
on
and
prices
are
all
ways
good
I
would
recomend
this
company,
the
only
thing
I
found
that
could
be
better
is
there
phone
service.
If
you
have
questions
or
just
want
to
speak
to
someone
about
what
you
would
like
to
order,
I
found
it
was
not
as
easy
as
I
thought
it
should
be.
Other
than
that
the
product
I
oredered
came
on
time
and
was
the
best
price
I
could
find.
Good
information
for
checking
out
different
locations.
Represented
quite
a
few
of
the
local
area
storage
companies.
Had
online
pricing
and
other
specials
quickly
available
along
with
maps
and
other
important
information.
I
called
Bookit
to
confirm
the
hotel
I
was
about
to
book
was
in
the
location
I
wanted,
they
confirmed
it
was.

It
was
not.

When
I
asked
to
cancel,
within
5
minutes,
they
refused.

The
supervisor
also
refused
to
cancel.

I
would
not
reccommend
booking
anything
with
them.
Lenses
were
not
marked
"left"
and

"right".
But
a
call
to
customer
service
quickly
cleared
that
up.
In
one
hour
they
installed
two
tires
balanced
and
did
a
four
wheel
alignement
Made
my
wife
and
myself
very
happy
!!!!!
I
just
love
B&H.
So
much.
They
didn't
advertise
on
the
website
that
they
weren't
in
stock.
I
ordered
them
early
Monday
morning,
expecting
them
by
Thursday.
Even
called
up
and
the
chap
said
Friday.
We
then
had
a
bank
holiday
so
they
didn't
arrive
until
the
the
following
Wednesday.
Wish
they'd
have
told
me
about
their
supply
problems
so
I
could
have
bought
elsewhere.
First
and
last
time
buyer
Always
on
time,
everything
in
good
shape,
always
of
good
quality,
I
even
had
one
return
with
no
problems...Thank
you!
Just
needed
to
return
a
lens
that
I
didn't
care
for.

No
problem
at
all.

B&H
are
GREAT
people
to

I

it

to
come
with
the

PartsGeek
customer
service
is
the
poorest
excuse
for
customer
service
I
have
ever
seen
in
an
online
company.

I
literally
waited
on
hold
for
more
than
2
hours
twice
and
never
talked
to
a
human,
that
was
both
for
sales
and
customer
service.

In
order
to
talk
to
a
person,
I
had
to
research
the
company
to
find
some
officers
then
look
up
personal
phone
numbers
for
them
and
call
before
I
was
able
to
actually
talk
to
a
person,
just
horrible.

Their
web
site
is
almost
as
poor
as
well.
I
ordered
the
Sommer
1
hp
lift
for
my
garage
door
and
it
arrived
very
quickly.

My
setup
is
unusual
and
it
would
not
work
for
my
needs.

They
were
great
about
return
and
suggested
the
Liftmaster
8500
Jackshaft
lift.

Waived
the
restocking
fee
on
my
return
since
I
ordered
a
different
product.

Were
very
helpful
on
the
phone
to
be
sure
the
LIftmaster
would
fit
and
function
properly.

Best
lift
I
can
imagine.

A+
all
around.
they
have
all
the
games
that
you
want
in
the
cheapest
prices!
Slight
issues
with
the
delivery,
items
stated
as
in
stock
in
website,
but
had
to
be
ordered,
however,
that
said,
more
than
happy
with
the
quality
when
they
arrived.
Nothing
too
much
trouble.
Curtious
service.
An
excellent
delivery
service
(
next
day
).
Thoroughly
RECOMMENDED.
Everything
was
as
expected.
The
best
of
everything
-
quality,
service
and
price.
Bam!
I
cannot
understand
why
it's
nearly
always
possible
to
purchase
the
smaller
weight
(3lb)
bags
of
species
specific
parrot
food,
(which
are
clearly
at
a
much
higher
per
kilo
cost)
yet
the
more
popular,
economical
weights
(8lb)
are
rarely
available??
I
really
enjoyed
this
tour,
though
it
was
my
third
time
on
the
Big

Tours.

I
just
moved
to
London
and
wanted
to
have
a
look
around,
this
was
a
fun
way
to
go!
Hey

I
didn't
think
this
would
happen
in
the
way
it
did,
but
I'd
been
fortunate
in
most
all
my
previous
online
purchases.

I
tried
this
company
for
the
first
time
and
found
myself
on
the
receiving
end
of
poor
service.

Not
only
did
they
send
a
used
part
in
a
torn
plastic
bag,
but
it
was
broken
too.

I
wish
they
had
cared
enough
to
inspect
the
shipment
before
packaging
the
parts.
I
guess
this
is
my
first
and
last
purchase
from
PartsGeek.
Unfortunately,
I
cannot
recommend
a
company
like
this
to
anyone.

I
shopped

Bookit.com

Sending
flowers

is
always
tricky

one
is
never

that
the

are
as
high

presented

We
were
fortunate
to
find
"iflorist"
to

deal
with
Supplement
Warehouse.
I
tried
to
return
something
...
sent
it
back
in
September
2012,
even
have
a
receipt
by
the
USPS
and
months
later
Partsjerks
say
they
never
received
it
and
won't
refund
my
money.
It
took
them
sometimes
well
over
a
week
to
respond
to
an
email.
They
stalled
for
so
long
that
it
passed
the
time
that
I
could
contest
the
charge
on
my
credit
card.
These
guys
are
crooks.
This
is
the
first
time
I've
had
a
company
act
as
unprofessional
as
they
have.
I
will
never
do
business
with
them
again.
On
a
better
note
Rockauto
is
MUCH
MUCH
better,
more
professional
and
I
think
better
prices.
Happy
Customer
with
good
quality
and
price
glasses.
Very
hard
and
firm
on
my
teeth
compared
to
previous
brush
head.
It
may
be
that
it
will
become
ok
as
I
become
used
to
it.
I
will
persevere
I
had
bought
a
4S
from
a
friend.

For
some
reason,
AT&T
did
not
have
it
in
their
system
and
after
several
calls
to
customer
service,
2
trips
to
the
store,
they
told
me
that
I
would
have
to
wait
for
14
months
till
it
was
eligible
to
be
unlocked.

I
was
about
to
put
it
on
craigslist,
but
stumbled
onto
this
website.

I
was
VERY
hesitant
to
give
it
a
shot,
but
after
extensive
checks
on
the
web
for
indications
of
a
scam,
I
didn't
see
any.

I
was
also
leery
that
myimeiunlock
was
writing
their
own
reviews
but
in
the
end,
I
took
a
chance
and
it
was
EXACTLY
as
promised.

The
directions
were
simple
as
well
as
quick
turn
around.

DO
IT!
Lots
of
choices,
with
good
prices
Redspot
were
good
to
deal
with
and
I
found
the
staff
excellent
with
the
exception
of
one
person
whom
I
suspect
was
a
new
employee
and
still
feeling
his
way.
He
wasn't
unpleasant
but
was
rather
slow
and
unsure.
friendly
banter
by
me
was
returned
in
kind
and
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
intended.
I've
been
using
Supp
Warehouse
for
3
years.

Now
that
they've
upgraded
their
shipping
I'm
definitely
now
going
anywhere.

Always
great
prices
and
the
price
matching
is
unrivaled.

I've
called
with
questions
and
the
staff
is
always
courteous
and
responsive.

Keep
up
the
great
work!
I
am
very
impressed
with
DIY
Lettering.
I
asked
a
question,
and
got
a
quick
response.
Parts
geek
let
me
suggest
that
you
include
instructions
for
returning
cores
in
your
emails
at
purchase.

Also
same
instructions
should
be
included
with
part.
Easy
usable
website,
which
makes
ordering
a
very
straight
forward
process.
Seems
to
work
in
a
clear
and
open
way.
No
surprises.
What
I
have
noticed
is
that
if
there
are
surprises,
they
are
'good'
surprises
A
great
place
to
get
Gift
Cards
for
friends
or
personal
use.
Would
recommend
the
site.
One
negative
is
the
alerts
are
sent
when
new
cards
are
available,
and
if
you
response
within
a
minute
of
getting
the
email
--
the
cards
are
gone.
As
much
as
I
dislike
committing
or
purchasing
things
on
line
the
site
was
simple
and
efficent.
Over
all
fast
service
and
easy
service
and
I
received
the
part
exactly
when
guaranteed
to.
Great
seller
I
really
recommend
lightinthebox!
I
bought
a
few
things
and
it
was
totally
worth
waiting
10
workingdays
for.
What
a
quality!
I
adoore
the
makeup-
brushes
i
bought
and
my
new
Iphone
case.
Gotta
buy
more
cases
from
there!
Been
there
done
that-
I
promise
you
I'll
visit
the
page
again!
I
have
used
B&H
for
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
because
they
carry
quality
products,
cater
to
professionals
and
amateurs
and
deal
with
integrity.
after
waiting
1
week

thanks

Excellent
service
fast
shipping
good
product
Generally
the
service
was
very
good
and
the
cruise
option
was
excellent.
I
ordered
my
rear
brake
rotor
&
I
have
to
say
was
very
happy
with
all
the
results.
It
came
on
timely
basis
&
in
good
shape
-
no
damages
from
shipping.
The
prices
was
great.
I
enjoyed
scrolling
through
the
other
options.
I
just
got
done
putting
it
on
&
it
was
great.
Just
wish
my
caliper
carrying
bolts
would
give
me
better
release.
Even
with
the
high
shipping
prices
-
the
total
price
was
still
lot
better
then
AutoZone.
Definitely
will
be
going
back
for
my
other
rotors.
A
bit
expensive
but
a
very
professional
team.
pleased
with
service
part
fit
without
any
problems
was
in
and
out
very
quick,
fixed
my
tire
and
it
cost
less
than
$10.
They're
awesome.
I
could
have
purchased
the
items
I
wanted
at
a
local
outlet
for
a
much
higher
price
but
opted
to
get
them
from
testequipment
depot.
I
follow
a
bunch
of
shows,
some
of
which
are
on
Hulu,
while
others
are
scattered
at
various
places
all
over
the
web.
Watch.io
makes
it
easy
to
find
the
episodes
i
want
and
go
straight
to
the
player.
I
also
like
that
they
do
no
have
any
advertisements
and
the
site
loads
quickly
I
have
been
using
Netflix
for
about
a
year,
primarily
using
the
streaming
option
with
a
Wii,
and
I
have
been
thrilled.
There
are
occasional
service
issues,
but
they
do
not
impact
viewing
significantly.
No
more
so
than
a
commercial.
You
pick
a
price,
they
"negotiate",
then
tell
you
what
to
do,
which
is
first
to
increase
your
price,
then
to
try
changing
your
options,
because
you're
not
going
to
get
what
you
want.

They
do
provide
the
average
successful
price
as
a
reference
point
after
the
fact
(not
sure
if
they
give
you
that
ballpark
figure
before
your
first
negotiation
attempt
though).
Well
designed
tee,
simple
and
nice
design
Ordered
a
left
and
right
hand
lower
control
arm
for
A
dodge
caliber.
First
time
using
partsgeek.com.
Received
two
left
hand
parts
a
week
later.
(No
shipping
options
available)
My
invoiced
stated
one
right
and
one
left.
Customer
service
is
a
joke.
They
would
respond
with
1
sentence
answers
which
did
not
answer
my
questions.
They
eventually
send
me
the
"correct"
link
for
the
right
hand
part.
Wait
another
week
for
the
part.
Invoice
states
right
hand
side.
Open
it
to
find
another
left.
Complain
again....
They
reply
with
"we'll
look
into
this."
So
I
want
send
back
two
of
the
three
lefts....
I
have
to
get
an
authorization
number
from
them
before
I
can.
Wait
several
days
before
they
reply
to
my
email.
Get
the
number.
Ask
them
if
they'll
reimburse
me
for
return
shipping
since
it
was
their
fault.
They
said
no.
So
I
can't
even
get
a
full
refund
for
Their
screw
ups.
I
ended
up
having
to
order
from
another
company.
Couldn't
be
without
a
vehicle
for
another
week.

Oh
and
the
best
part.....
I
paid
three
different
prices
for
the
exact
same
part!!!!!
Inkfarm
is
a
very
reliable
customer
service
oriented
site.

No
problems
with
the
products.

I
received
an
incorrect
cartridge
once,
and
it
was
replaced
with
postage
paid
very
quickly.
My
main
supplier
of
seeds,
plants
and
general
equipment
for
the
garden
and
allotment.
This
is
because
plants
and
seeds
have
been
successful
and
the
plug

plants
generally
more
sturdy
than
other
suppliers
I
have
tried.

There
has
been
the
occasional
problem
with
individual
items
-
late
availability
springs
to
mind
-
but
a
'phone
call
sorted
out
matters.

Excellent
customer
service
team
don't
keep
you
on
the
line
but
call
you
back
if
necessary.

Web
site
a
bit
cumbersome
when
trying
to
monitor
orders.
AS
THE
PRODUCT
IS
MADE
OUT
OF
NATURAL
OAK
AND
THIS
WAS
MY
FIRST
ORDER
I
WAS
PARTICULARLY
CONCERNED
ABOUT
QUALITY.

THE
PICTURE
ON
THE
WEBPAGE
LOOKED
GREAT,
HENCE
THE
ORDER,
AND
JUST
WHAT
I
WANTED
SO
WHEN
THE
GOODS
CAME
I
WAS
DELIGHTED
THAT
THE
QUALITY
WAS
EVERYTHING
I
COULD
HAVE
HOPED
FOR.

THE
ADMIN.,
DELIVERY
AND
COMMUNICATION
WAS
EXCELLENT
AND
I
WILL
HAVE
NO
FEARS
ABOUT
ORDERING
AGAIN
IF
AND
WHEN
I
NEED
TO.
The
representative
was
very
helpful.
The
Onnit
site
has
a
lot
of
broken
and
outdated
links,
and
things
that
would/wouldn't
move
to
the
cart.

It
was
ok
and
I
was
able
to
make
my
order,
but
it
was
also
a
bit
of
a
pain.
Good
description
of
parts,
delivered
as
ordered!


Will
purchase
from
here
again!
My
reservation
was
promply
processed
upon
arrival
and
the
customer
service
was
very
good.
The
documentation
and
pre-travel
information
was
very
helpful
and
explanatory
for
any
questions
I
might
have
had.
I
will
definately
use
again.
Thanks
exactly
what
I
wanted
quixk
ship
Part
was
sent
in
a
timely
manner.

My
only
problem
was
that
it
was
an
A/C
compressor
and
did
not
state
that
in
came
with
(or
without)
the
clutch.

In
fact,
it
came
without.

Parts
Geek
was
very
ready
to
accept
the
return,
however
i
damaged
pieces
of
the
old
one
in
the
removal
and
had
to
use
the
new
hoping
my
clutch
was
actually
OK.

It
was
not,
but
that
is
on
me.

All
in
all
I
am
happy
with
this
merchant.
They
by
far
have
the
best
prices
around
and
also
the
best
service
around.
I
love
when
you
check
out
they
also
give
you
the
extra
deals
:)

Thanks
To

For
all
your
Help.
B&H
has
great
inventory,
knowledgeable
and
helpful
staff,
ships
quickly
and
inexpensively.
Their
web
site
is
easy
to
navigate,
informative
and
very
helpful.
It's
always
a
pleasure
to
shop
at
B&H.
They're
not
paying
me
to
write
this
-
this
is
an
honest
opinion
from
a
real
customer.
Ordered
USN
protein
delite
bars
which
were
a
round
10%
cheaper
than
the
usual
suplement
sites
I
use.

Got
an
addition
discount
for
signing
up
for
the
newsletter,
with
next
day
free
shipping.

The
bars
arrived
the
next
day
via
DPD
who
gave
me
a
precise
time
slot
for
delivery.

Very
good
and
competitive
service,
will
use
again.
Painful
waste
of
time
and
no
customer
service.
Can
not
talk
to
a
human
and
they
love
to
sell
you
parts
that
are
not
what
you
need.

Either
the
staff
consists
of
untrained
retired
elevator
operators
or
just
the
metally
challenged.
avoid
doing
business
with
this
company
at
all
costs
unless
you
like
to
waste
endless
hours
of
time
and
money
with
this
underperforming
under
delivering
company.
I
had
a
straightforward
order.
A
rear
windshield
wiper
arm
and
blade
and
they
could
not
manage
to
successfully
send
me
the
correct
parts.
Great
job
by
the
people
at
PartsGeek
.
They
sent

my
part
out
to
me
in
a
timely
manner.

My
part
arrived
in
great
condition
,
packed
well
and
on
the
day
they
told
me
it
would
be
here.
Good
price
also!
What
else
could
you
ask
for.
The
exhaust
parts
I
ordered
were
at
an
unbeatable
price!
I
had
checked
at
my
local
parts
stores,
and
even
with
the
shipping
charges
your
prices
beat
them
by
a
lot!
Would,
will
and
already
have
recommended
you
to
all
of
my
friends.
Received
the
parts
in
a
timely
fashion,
well
packed.
My
2005
Audi
allroad
takes
the
"Aero"
front
wipers
though
as
do
2002-2005
Audi
allroads.
I
was
sent
the
wrong
Bosch
front
wipers.
The
rear
wiper
and
the
headlight
switch
were
correct.
Bosch's
own
website
shows
the
wrong
part
for
my
car,
so
PartsGeek
isn't
without
company
in
this
error.
Excellent
customer
service.
I
haven't
bought
a
single
supplement
from
anywhere
else
in
the
last
four
years.
With
the
5
percent
price
match
there
isn't
a
better
price
on
any
supplement
you
can
think
of!
Their
shipping
is
fast
and
priced
fairly
and
I
haven't
had
any
problems
whatsoever
in
four
years,
and
to
top
it
off
the
products
are
always
fresh
unlike
some
other
internet
stores!
I
would
say
my
main
beef
with
this
company
is
the
fact
i
was
charged
twice
for
one
booking
at
a
total
of
$540.00,
I
did
make
a
reservation,
cancelled
it
and
then
rebooked
but
I
was
never
refunded
the
original
charge,
all
done
some
months
prior
to
the
date
of
travel,
so
not
particularly
impressed.
arrived
on
time
I
ordered
a
set
of
front
struts
on
sale
for
my
truck
on
a
Saturday
evening.
They
were
on
my
front
porch
Tuesday
afternoon
when
I
got
home
from
work.
I
had
already
set
up
an
appointment
with
a
mechanic
friend
of
mine
to
install
them
on
Friday.
I
had
him
put
them
on
Wednesday.
I'll
definitely
buy
parts
from
this
source
again,
and
recommend
them
to
anyone
I
know.
Great
facility,
nice
employees.
I
wish
hand
carts
were
available
during
all
hours,
not
just
office
hours,
but
it's
not
that
big
of
a
deal.
Ordered
a
new
cover
for
my
iPhone
and
had
an
item
dispatched
email
within
an
hour.
Now
thats
what
I
call
Fast
Service!
I
placed
my
order
and
received
a
confirmation
instantly.
The
price
was
good
and
as
I'm
in
Jersey
I
was
really
grateful
there
was
no
premium
placed
on
the
postage
charge
as
sometimes
happens
with
some
suppliers.
I
was
surprised
again
with
the
speed
of
the
dispatch
and
delivery.
The
overall
experience
was
excellent
with
great
communication,
good
prices
and
good
delivery.
I
have
ben
using
parts
geek
for
years
they
are
awsome
everything
comes
to
your
door
perfect
with
no
problems
the
only
downfall
is
it
would
be
nice
if
parts
geek
sold
tires
A
clean
room,
check
in
and
out
couldn't
be
easier.

Breakfast
was
very
good.
A
great
price
,
coupled
with
super
fast
delivery
.
B&H
had
the
product
I
needed
in
stock
at
a
very
reasonable
price.
My
experience
was
very
good
placing
the
order.
I
appreciate
and
I
the
information
I've
received
As
always
I
had
a
great
customer
experience.
Great
Ordering
with
fast
shipping!
I
have
used
global
webpay
for
some
time
and
have
made
a
lot
of
transfers
through
them.

The
support
is
excellent
and
they
always
go
the
extra
mile
to
help
resolve
the
issues
which
have
always
been
of
my
making!!
Very
easy
dealing
with
Chewy.com.
Much
better
prices
than
Amazon,
free
and
fast
shipping.
Everything
worked
out
great.
I'll
be
using
Chewy
again.
Excellent
service
as
always
I
live
in
the
next
state
over,
but
still.
I
clicked
"submit"
at
9pm,
to
order
my
part
and
they
had
it
in
the
shipping
system
by
10pm.
When
I
went
home
for
lunch
the
next
day
it
was
sitting
at
my
house.
Unreal.
Parts
are
parts,
and
you
win
some
and
you
lose
some,
just
about
anywhere
you
buy
from.
That's
the
nature
of
the
industry.
This
time
I
won,
and
got
a
good
part.
So
expect
this
business
to
be
what
it
is:
a
parts
distributor,
but
damn
do
they
know
how
to
process
an
order
fast!
The
website
was
excellent
and
easy
to
use.
I
enjoyed
that
they
offered
so
much
free
stuff
and
that
they
had
what
I
wanted
for
a
cheap
price.
They
also
offer
a
way
to
match
prices.
Shippments
of
products
were
prompt
and
the
products
produced
the
results
that
were
advertised.
The
door
I
ordered
was
just
as
we
wanted
and
the
company
kept
me
in
touch.
However
when
I
got
the
e-mail
linking
me
to
XPD
then
the
problems
began.
I
could
not
e-mail
the
local
depot
to
arrange
a
delivery
date.
I
phoned
them
on
the
Monday
and
arranged
for
delivery
the
following
Monday.
They
turned
up
on
the
day
after
my
phone
call
and
couldn't
believe
we
were
not
in!!!
Eventually
got
a
delivery
on
the
Thursday
and
I
told
them
I
was
going
away
and
had
to
pick
my
wife
up
from
work
at
12.00
as
we
were
setting
off
from
her
workplace.
They
arrived
at
13.30
and
wondered
why
I
was
annoyed.
Fitting
station
was
really
helpful,
a
really
good
service
Ich
bin
mit
busuu.com
höchst
zufrieden!
Für
mich
mit
Abstand
das
beste
Sprachlerntool
was
ich
bis
jetzt
gefunden
habe.
Ich
habe
damit
mein
Spanisch
aufgebessert
und
beginne
jetzt
auch
noch
mit
ein
bisschen
Italienisch.
Super
einfach
aufgebaut,
macht
Spass
und
die
Premium-Mitgliedschaft
zahlt
sich
auch
echt
aus.
Erstklassig!
I
spent
a
year
overseas
ordering
from
bodybuilding.com
until
a
buddy
of
mine
told
me
he
could
get
the
same
exact
thing
i
ordered
for
much
less
at
supplementwarehouse.com.
I
didnt
believe
him
until
I
compared
everything
I
order
monthly
and
realized
I
was
paying
wayyyyy
too
much
money.
I'll
never
order
from
another
site
again.
These
guys
are
great!

They
are
eager
to
find
out
exactly
what
I
want,
how
to
ship
it
to
me
and
always
have
competitive
prices.

The
range
of
merchandise
is
broad
and
of
high
quality.

Their
follow-up
on
sales
lets
me
know
that
they
are
genuinely
concerned
about
my
satisfaction
and
look
forward
to
having
me
continue
as
a
customer.

And
so
I
will!
Great
coffee,
super
fast
delivery-

order
was
accurate!
hot
chocolate
(in
keurig
cups)was
thin,watery
and
not
very
flavorful.
I
have
several
full
spectrum
floor
lamps,
both
the
42
and
70
watt
models,
and
they
are
excellent.
Providing
the
best
light
for
reading,
these
lamps
are
well
made
and
fully
dimmable.
Highly
recommended.
First
time
in
using
the
company
and
from
the
uploading
and
the
proofing,
it
was
problem
free.
We
just
rented
our
storage
unit
today
and
were
impressed
with
the
owner-he
was
so
helpful
and
personable
and
even
met
us
there
to
show
us
around.

Nice
facility
and
best
rate
around....
The
cab
corners
I
ordered
came
in
about
3-4
days
after
I
made
my
order
and
look
to
be
of
a
good
quality
and
match/fit.
I'll
know
more
when
I
get
the
job
done
and
.
But
they
sure
look
like
they'll
fit-
up
nice
which
will
finish
off
making
my
01
p-up
looking
like
new
again.
I
just
lack
finishing
thanks
to
the
Parts
Geeks.
I
take
care
of
my
brother
who
is
mentally
handicap
and
likes
to
play
video
games
around
the
clock.
He
was
nagging
me
to
get
him
a
$10
PSN
card.
I
normally
get
them
at
Wal-Mart
but
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
snow
storm
and
I
wasn't
driving
out
to
it
so
I
Googled
it
and
found
this
site.
It
looked
secure
enough
and
I
am
a
bit
of
a
risk
taker
so
I
took
the
plunge
and
did
it.
Neither
of
us
was
too
happy
about
the
extra
$2.99
charge
to
get
the
$10
PSN
credit
but
I
put
in
the
code
and
it
worked
like
it
was
suppose
to.
I
guess
paying
the
$2.99
is
a
minor
inconvenience
when
compared
to
being
nagged
by
someone
who
selfishly
thinks
of
themselves
all
the
time
and
tries
to
get
you
to
do
things
for
them
not
understanding
the
danger
that
I
could
be
in.
He's
my
brother
though
and
I
will
continue
to
love
and
care
for
him
anyway.
Thank
you
PC
Game
Supply
for
your
service!
I
am
happy
to
say
that
after
searching
for
years
and
years
I
finally
was
able
to
get
a
NEW
windshield
washer
fluid
bottle
for
my
1974
Pontiac
Ventura
Custom
GTO
which
I
own
for
34+
years
and
am
now
restoring
it.
This
was
one
of
the
final
touches
I
needed
to
(just
about)
complete
my
restoration.
THANK
YOU

SupplementWarehouse.com
has
a
great
selection
of
products
at
very
reasonable
prices.
The
samples
and
gifts
make
purchases
even
more
special.
The
customer
service
is
pretty
awesome,
too.
it
was
quick
and
easy
to
book
my
trip
to
vegas
and
so
will
yours
The
Selection
of
items
was
very
good,
and
the
price
very
competitive.
Carries
homeopathic
remedies
you
don't
find
at
places
like
Whole
Foods
or
Erewhon
in
the
standard
Boiron
rack
I
enjoyed
from
start
to
finish
the
ordering
process
and
would
order
from
them
again.
They
seem
to
have
all
the
shower
spares
you
could
ever
need.
Prices
were
about
the
best
I
could
find,
but
I
placed
my
order
Sunday
afternoon,
and
FedEx
wasn't
notified
until
Thursday
evening
that
my
packages
were
ready
to
be
shipped.
I
searched
the
net
for
a
US
source
for
alternative
tortoise
shell
in
the
large
blanks
and
could
not
find
any
in
stock
anywhere.
Finally
I
found
them
at
Axminster
in
the
UK.
The
purchase
was
easy
and
the
export
specialist
made
it
a
breeze.
Shipping
was
fast
and
arrived
much
sooner
than
expected
and
actually
made
it
faster
than
some
US
orders
made
at
the
same
time.
I'm
glad
I
found
Axminster
because
they
have
other
hard
to
find
turning
stock
not
readily
found
here
in
the
US.
was
able
to
utilize
your
part
with
ease
Very
impresive
delivery
time
withing
two
days
from
placing
the
order
got

it,
fair
price!
The
Online
Pen
Company
has
a
great
selection
of
pens,
and
accessories,
at
very
reasonable
prices
-
even
including
the
delivery
fee,
I
got
my
Waterman
pen
from
them
for
half
the
price
of
the
shops
here
in
NZ.
On
top
of
that,
the
pen
arrived
promptly
one
week
after
ordering.
I
booked
2
bookings
for
me
and
another
family

the
first
booking
I
bought
premium
insurance
just
in
case
we
had
to
cancel
due
to
ANY
reason

and
it
would
be
covered.
About
1
wk
later
it
became
apparent
one
party
may
not
be
able
to
travel.
Hence
prompted
call
to
customer
service
to
only
hear
in
a
rude
matter
of
fact
way....
Sorry
u
can't
cancel
and
receive
full
credit.
You
will
only
receive
about
1/4
credit

and
no
sorry
you
can't
change
name
of
your
passenger
to
another
as
it's
non
transferable.
WOW
and
I
bought
premium
insurance
for
what???
Then
I
booked
the
additional
party
to
travel
with
us
and
the
flight
was
off
due
to
my
error
and
I
accept
that.
However
when
I
call
customer
service
she
said
its
$200
per
ticket
plus
service
fees
and
difference
in
flight
(which
was
cheaper)
however
we
couldn't
receive
credit
for
the
cheaper
flight
only
additional
charges.
In
the
airline
flight
changes
it
states
$25
for
a
change....
Oh
yeah
that's
for
hotel
to
change
it
and
then
we
charge
$200

plus
additional
fees.
It
was
not
the
actual
policy
but
the
deliverance
of
the
results.
I
am
a
business
lady
and
I
work
face
to
face
with
customers/clients
daily.
There
is
no
way
that
I
would
ever
speak
to
my
clients
on
a
level
that
they
owe
me
anything
or
try
to
belittle
them
as
if
they
are
illiterate.
If
you
must
work
with
the
public
please
have
respect
for
others
and
keep
in
mind
if
it
not
for
the
customer
you
speaking
with
you
may
not
be
employed.
It
is
the
customers
that
create
and
maintain
your
employment
so
consider
making
the
customer
happy
so
they
will
return
and/or
send
you
referrals.
Guter
Service.

Very
acurate
and
quick
response
Pretty
much
sums
it
up,
had
great
deals
on
a
lot
of
other
games
as
well.
Probably
the
quickest
cdkey
purchase
I've
made
in
the
last
3
years.
They
have
a
great
selection
of
choices!!
and
just
about
every
part
you
would
need.
I
just
wish
that
they
had
the
option
to
select
if
your
truck
is
diesel
or
gas,
because
I
recently
purchased
tie
rods
from
them
and
they
came
in
wrong,
cause
i
really
couldnt
tell
wich
ones
i
needed
becuase
it
didnt
specifiy
on
the
tie
rods.
Also
i
wish
i
could
have
a
choice
to
pay
for
faster
shipping,
most
things
are
ground
only,
but
all
that
said,
its
a
great
site!!

Parts
Geek
says
they
hold
customer
satisfaction
high
and
in
past
years
I
have
found
it
to
be
excellent
but
now
they
have
decided
it
is
too
costly
to
actually
speak
with
their
customers.

They
want
the
whole
process
to
be
done
through
email.

I
ordered
a
part
and
wished
to
discuss
it
with
them
to
make
sure
it
was
the
right
part
but
could
not
get
a
person
on
the
phone.

Ended
up
ordering
the
part
and
found
it
was
not
correct.

I
got
the
part
the
next
day,
excellent
service
at
that
point
but
after
finding
it
was
the
wrong
part,
the
pain
began.

I
still
could
not
speak
to
anyone
when
I
needed
to
return
the
part
and
also
ask
them
about
ordering
the
correct
part,
so
I
was
forced
to
go
through
email

again
for
what
I
now
know
will
be
the
last
time.

It
took
almost
2
weeks
for
them
to
send
me
the
return
number
with
the
instructions
on
how
it
should
be
returned.

Don't
believe
it
when
you
read
customer
satisfaction

is
their
main
concern.

It
ended
up
I
got
tired
of
waiting
for
them
to
call
me
back
as
they
said
they
would
do
through
their
website
and
I
found
another
vendor
that
was
significantly
cheaper
for
the
exact
same
part.

Bye
bye
PartsGeek.
This
company
had
a
website
that
was
easy
to
use
and
they
shipped
itreal
quickly.It
arrived
right
when
they
said
it
would,
I
would
definitly
buy
from
them
again.
I
had
bought
a
90
day
members
subscription
to
Runescape.

the
game
code
I
was
given
was
not
valid,
and
I
therefore
could
not
receive
the
product
I
had
originally
intended
to
buy.

this
would
be
about
the
8th
time
I
have
used
this
site
for
the
same
purpose.

in
that
aspect
I
can
understand
that
mistakes
happen.

after
24
hrs
of
many
emails
back
and
forth
I
was
finally
just
given
a
refund
when
I
should
have
been
given
a
valid
game
code
in
return.

pc
game
supply
had
informed
me
that
I
would
redeem
this
code
on
runescape.com
when
I
received
the
code.
which
I
had
done
in
the
past.

when
this
code
did
not
work
they
then
told
me
it
was
an
ultimate
game
card
code.
this
should
have
been
told
to
me
in
the
first
place
but
it
was
not.

and
apparently
I
was
charged
22.95
when
an
ultimate
game
card
is
19.95.


the
code
did
not
match
with
the
regular
format
of
ultimate
game
cards.
I
have
used
them
before.

the
code
I
was
given
was
the
same
format
of
previous
runescape
cards
I
have
bought
from
this
same
site.
overall
the

failure
to
send
me
a
valid
game
code
was
quite
disappointing
and
the
information
I
received
in
the
emails
seemed
to
be
a
made
up
excuse.

poor
service
honestly
and
I
won't
be
using
this
site
again.
sorry.
Never
had
an
issue
with
Strong
VPN.
Customer
service
is
friendly
and
sincerely
wants
to
help.
The
servers
are
fast.
Strong
VPN
is
of
great
value
to
me
b/c
I
travel
and
when
I'm
abroad
on
a
WiFI
at
a
cafe
or
similar,
my
traffic
is
protected.
The
other
secondary
use
is
for
me
to
get
access
to
region
restricted
content.
The
purchase
went
smoothly.

I
don't
need
the
tartan
or
the
(English)
crest
as
I
have
my
family
Tartan
(Weir)
and
(Scottish)
crest.

I
do
plan
on
camping
there
some
day.
Fast
delivery,
easy
site
to
navigate,
everything
you
could
ever
need
to
get
the
job
done.
I
first
started
last
year
buying
the
chlorine.
I
couldn't
have
been
happier.
My
wife
and
I
marveled
at
how
clean
and
clear
the

was
all
summer.
That
was
really
fast
to
get
my
coupon,
thanks
a
lot
!!
Amazingly
quick
and
easy
ordering
with
equally
amazing
quick
delivery
My
first
time
using
envirofone.
Everything
was
well
explained
and
simple
to
do.
Very
efficient
service
and
timing
on
delivering
box
for
the
phone
and
then
the
payment.
5/5!
Ordered
from
these
guys
a
few
times
now
and
they've
always
delivered.
Unlike
others,
delivery
takes
only
a
few
days
and
the
quality
of
their
products
is
right
up
there.
I'd
recommend
and
will
continue
to
use.
The
combination
of
a
fair
price,
prompt
delivery
and
excellent
customer
service
is
what
I
got
when
ordering
a
pool
filter.
Will
do
it
again.
Delivered
the
goods,
on
time
and
as
promised.
About
all
you
can
ask.
In
short,
the
greatest
compliment
you
can
pay
a
vendor
is
to
answer
YES
to
the
question
"Would
you
do
it
again."
Unequivocally,
YES.
The
overall
process
was
easy
to
follow
and
I
would
highly
reccomend
it.
Being
an
ex
motor
trader
I
respect
HPI
as
an
organisation
to
trust
and
respect.
Shopping
is
easy
and
advice
is
always
available.
fast
response,
disappointed
with
online
discount
but
overll
satisfied
Very
informative
and
okay
to
follow
the
steps.
Must
admit
I
had
help
from
a
fellow
traveller.
Received
my
order
in
3
days
which
was
super
fast.
It
was
just
what
I
was
looking
for.
Will
order
from
PartsGeek
in
the
future.
Used
several
times,quick
delivery
and
best

Very
nice
work
and
care
in
delivering
my

Great
company
to
work
with,
on

of

This

my

It

2pm
and
it
was
on
my
doorstep
Friday
at
8.30am
at
no
extra
cost!
Very
impressed!
And
very
satisfied
with
my
product!
Great
stuff!
Highly
recommended!
I
got
the
exactly
what
I
ordered
the
first
time,
sent
on
time,
and
at
a
fair
price.
Thank
you.
Everything
went
without
a
hitch.
In
all
my
interactions
so
far
I've
found
B&H
courteous
and
reliable
we
were
very
pleased
with
our
curtains
When
my
Garmin
GPS
sports
watch
&
GoPro
action
camera
stopped
working
properly.
I
was
glad
I
had
the
foresight
to
purchase
insurance
for
them
using
SquareTrade.
I
called
them
&
they
made
it
very
easy
&
painless.
They
took
care
of
me
and
made
sure
my
devices
were
fixed
no
hassle.
One
of
the
products
I
ordered
is
made
up
of
very
cheap
parts
and
has
already
broken.
I
assume
the
rest
of
the
products
are
just
as
cheap,
however
some
have
not
been
installed
yet.
One
product
that
I
returned
took
lots
of
follow
up
emails
on
my
part,
customer
service
rep
must
have
lost
track
of
my
return
because
I
had
to
tell
her
multiple
times
what
the
order
number
was.
It
took
a
very
long
time
to
actually
get
my
money
back.
The
30
return
policy
is
not
enough
time.
I
would
never
recommend
this
product
or
company.
Fast
shipping,

good
price.

My
first
time
as
a
buyer
at
vetrxdiretc
sono
stato
contento
e
sono
contento
del
servizio
che
ho
ricevuto
senza
ombra
di
dubbio
in
futuro
utilizzerò
ancora
il
vostro
sito
per
prenotare
l'auto
grazie
ed
arrivederci
Thanks
to
DriveTime,
I
got
my
dream
vehicle
and
with
LOW

PAYMENT!!!
Thanks
to
salesmen
Kyle
and
Kevin
of
DriveTime
in
Huntsville
for
making
our
buying
a
GREAT
experience!
I
had
searched
for
suitable
replacement
rollers
for
my
ageing
shower
door
and
Showerseal
had
them
at

a
very
reasonable
price
compared
to
some
other
suppliers.
Delivery
was
prompt,
the
rollers
fitted
easily
and
do
the
job
perfectly
well.Would
certainly
recommend
this
company.
I
had
searched
for
an
extension
for
my
Outwell
tent
on
lots
of
sites
but
the
prices
were
putting
me
off.

I
was
about
to
give
up
when
I
found
Taunton
Leisure
offering
a
great
deal
.
I
thought
that
it
would
probably
be
out
of
stock,that's
what
normally
happens
when
I
find
a
bargain,
but
was
wrong
and
able
to
put
in
the
order.
Buying
was
easy,
Taunton
Leisure
kept
me
informed
about
delivery
and
the
product
arrived
exactly
as
promised
within
a
couple
of
days.
Excellent
!
Good
prices
and
overnight
delivery
standard
on
most
items.
Excellent
and
easy
way
to
park
your
car
while
going
on
holiday.The
check
in
and
indeed
the
pick
up
of
your
vehicle
just
could
not
be
easier.Staff
really
friendly
and
helpful
and
both
arrival
and
departures
take
no
more
than
just
afew
minutes,would
definitely
recommend
and
would
not
hesitate
to
use
again.
Very
pleased
with
the
service,
and
with
the
speed
of
delivery.

Everything
went
smoothly
Supplement
Warehouse
has
the
best
products
with
the
best
deals
on
the
internet.

There
are
always
amazing
clearance
and
blowout
deals
were
you
can
get
all
your
protein
needs
at
a
minimal
price.

The
customer
service
has
always
been
friendly
and
prompt.
We
purchased
an
entertainment
unit
and
computer
desk.

Both
arrived
on
time,
well
packaged
and
perfect.

Service
was
outstanding.

Wouldn't
hesitate
to
buy
again.
After
doing
long
term
parking
with
spouse,
luggage
and
two
toddlers,
I
found
it
incredibly
difficult
to
move
everyone
and
thing
to
the
lot
even
with
the
shuttle.
I
own
a
small
business
and
travel
on
business
nearly
every
week
and
am
thankful
for
Priceline.
I
can
honestly
say
the
site
has
gives
me
peace
of
mind
and
improves
my
travel
experience.

Corporate
road
warriors
frequently

have
negotiated
rates
with
hotels
but
as
a
small
business
I
had
no
buying
power.
With
Prices
always
changing
based
on
demand
I
always
worried
I
was
paying
"too
much".
With
Priceline
competitive
bidding
I
know
I
am
paying
a
fair
rate
for
the
date
and
area
I
am
traveling
to.
I
use
the

instant
deals
prices
as
a
window
into
the
market
rates.
The
part
was
more
than
I
expected,
assembly,
bulbs
and
socket.
I
wish
I
new
all
that
was
included
when
I
bought
it.
I
didn't
know
that
the
socket
were
included
so
emailed
them
and
they
got
back
with
me
right
away.
Also
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
here.
Should
have
tried
next
day
shipping.
the
service
was
very
good.

timely,
easy
(even
with
3
small
kids).

would
recommend...
Salesman
was
excellent
and
helped
enormously,
understanding
the
need
for
urgency.

The
delivery
guys
were
also
excellent
and
didn't
complain
about
anything
despite
the
bed
having
to
be
delivered
to
the
top
floor
of
a
3
story
town
house!
It
was
easy
to
pick
what
i
wanted
with
the
best
prices,
And
was
super
fast
to
get
the
game
keys!
Never
had
a
problem
with
ordering
from
these
guys,
good
service,
quick
delivery
and
decent
prices
compared
to
others.
Wouldn't
buy
from
anyone
else
at
this
stage.
Transaction
was
lightining-fast
and
very
smooth:
I
didn't
even
know
this
site
existed
and
less
than
five
minutes
later
I
was
submitting
my
cd-key
to
the
Guild
Wars
2
website
for
activation.
Flashbay
is
a
quality
company
that
delivers
a
good
product
that
is
pre-selected
from
an
excellent
sample
package
send
prior
to
purchase
in
one
day.

The
speed
of
service,
communication
and
follow
up
is
second
to
none.

I'd
like
to
steal
a
few
of
Flashbay's
employees!!
Good
offers,
quick
efficient
service.
I
made
some
limoncello
and
grapefruit
cello
and
bottled
it
in
small
bottles.
I
don't
do
anything
half
way,
so
i
googled
up
wine
labelers
to
see
if
I
could
come
up
with
an
inexpensive
label
for
my
after
dinner
liquor.
Tada,
up
popped
this
great
company,
myownlabels.com,
and
like
they
say,
the
rest
is
history.

I
found,
outstanding
workmanship
in
their
product,
a
price
that
can't
be
beat
and
quick
delivery.
Mamma
mia,
what
can
I
say,
but
thanks
for
an
outstanding
company
and
service
that
rates
the
same.
Now,
back
to
the
kitchen
for
my
next
batch,
lime
cello!
Great
as
always
for
many
years
already.
The
best
place
for
your
photo
needs.
I
had
a
visit
in
London
and
i
booked
a
24
hours
ticked
via
web.
I
bought
wheels
on
sale
and
some
other
stuft.
Well
packaged
and
fast
delivery.
I
am
very
satisfied.
Lyft
is
awesome,
that
is
all
there
is
to
it.

When
I
first
tried
it,
I
knew
instantly
I
would
never
take
another
cab
ride.

Now
that
I
am
a
driver
for
Lyft,
I
can
tell
you
that
the
awesomeness
on
the
inside
is
exactly
how
it
appears
on
the
outside!
Would
totally
recommend,
better
than
the
"other"
psrcel
companies.
I
have
used
autoeurope
on
two
occasions.
Our
teenage
son
struck
a
rock
with
our
Volvo
and
put
a
hole
in
the
oil
pan.
The
local
authorized
Volvo
repair
shop
estimated
the
pan
replacement
would
cost
close
to
$1000.00.
Purchase
process
was
fine.
However,
I
sent
an
e-mail
question
through
the
web
site
and
never
received
a
response.
I
was
not
impressed.
I
was
having
some
disturbing
chest
pains
so
I
decided
to
buy
some
wild
crafted,
Nature's
Answer
Hawthorn
Berry
supplements
at
PureFormulas.com,
to
support
my
cardiovascular
health.

I'm
so
very
glad
that
I
did
because
I'm
already
feeling
a
whole
lot
better!
Over
the
last
6
months
I've
used
Ego-Ts,
DS901s,
501-Ts,
Pipes
and
now
the
iMist.
I
would
buy
with
the
utmost
confidence
that
your
personal
information
will
remain
secure,
the
one
time
i
had
an
issue
was
due
to
a
mistake
I
MADE,
and
i
was
made
aware
promptly.
I
found
supplement
warehouse
a
while
ago
and
am
always
impressed
with
the
prices,
deals,
and
ease
of
shopping.

So
many
other
sites
are
all
show
and
no
go.

I
love
the
search
engine
and
the
ease
of
payment.

I
just
ordered
my
supps
5
minutes
ago
and
KNOW
there
won't
be
any
problems!

Thx
guys
I
was
very
pleased
with
Ellis
Bringham's
service.
My
order
wasn't
quite
right,
but
on
the
phone
and
via
email,
they
got
it
sorted,
fast.
It
is
very
refreshing
to
talk
to
a
real
person,
not
a
robot,
(or
a
person
who
thinks
they
are
a
robot),
when
there
is
a
problem,
these
guys
are
nice,
helpful
too.
i
got
great
equipment
and
great
service,
at
a
good
price.
The
only
negative,
was
the
delivery
company
they
used.
I
will
certainly
be
buying
from
Ellis
Bringham
again.
Myprotein
is
a
excellent
website
and
has
a
good
choice
of
products,
I
like
that
fact
they
have
great
deals
and
you
get
points
ever
time
you
buy
Easy
to
order,
quick
to
come
and
returned
easy
with
fast
payment
fantastic
job
on
a
rush
order,
everything
was
PERFECT!
Would
definitely
recommend
Travelocity.

Saved
a
good
chunk
of
money
going
through
them.

Fast.
.
Booked
our
room
standing
at
the
counter.

Amazing.
I
got
my
book
quickly
and
it
was
exactly
what
I
needed.
It
cost
a
lot
less
through
Bookbyte.
i
would
be
happy
to
recommend
Country
Attire
to
anyone.
The
service
is
fantastic,
fast
delivery
and
free
return
if
unsuitable!
You
can't
go
wrong.
My
purchase
was
confirmed
and
shipped
quickly.
Puntuali
e
affidabili.......doti
rare
in
questo
periodo!!
Fast
and
easy
!
I
bought
Black
Ops
2
from
CJS
cdkeys
and
had
no
trouble
whatsoever
doing
it.
Autokey
had
a
bit
of
friction
with
my
phone
service
provider
regarding
their
verification
key,
and
I
had
to
borrow
my
roomate's
phone
(it's
because
mine
is
a
prepaid).
Other
than
that
everything
went
nicely
and
took
like
5
minutes
to
get
my
key
activated
on
Steam.
I
wanted
to
get
Dark
Souls
for
a
decent
price
so
I
googled
around
a
bit
and
these
guys
came
up.
Did
some
investigation
and
they
seemed
trustworthy,
so
I
went
through
with
the
order.
Outstanding
service:
Got
a
good
deal
on
Barum
tyres,
fitted
at
National
but
much
cheaper
than
them.
Very
helpful
on
phone
too.
The
best
deal
in
town
is
getting
what
you
pay
for.

Parts
Geeks
takes
that
concept
to
a
new
level
with
the
best
prices,
the
best
quality
parts,
and
the
superior
service.

I
am
refreshed
that
there
is
at
least
one
company
serving
America
who
puts
customer
needed,
service,
and
ethics
foremost
in
their
dealings.

Most
other
companies
in
America
are
"bate
and
switch"
bottomline
scammers.

Parts
Geek
is
straight
up
and
even
our
government
could
take
some
lessons
from
their
example.

It
is
so
unique
when
the
cheat
and
lie
is
not
the
main
paradigym
of
a
company
as
it
is
with
the
government
and
most
companies.
Received
my
product
in
a
good
amount
of
time.
Two
tabs
were
broken
on
it.
No
way
to
get
a
hold
of
someone.
Support
ticket
takes
too
long
for
a
response
and
no
live
person
to
speak
to.

Had
to
make
part
work
since
truck
had
no
front
end
otherwise.

Plus
it
was
a
tad
smaller
than
oem
size.
Web
site
works
great
and
always
easy
to
work
with.

This
is
by
far
the
best
web
site
to
work
with.

Some
sites
are
a
disaster
to
work
with.

Some
companies
want
to
call
you
back
to
pressure
for
additional
sales,
I
never
go
back.
I
ordered
a
replacement
part
for
my
99
Chevy
Tahoe
and
it
was
1/2
the
cost
of
the
local
parts
stores
and
it
fit
as
well
as

the
original.

I
will
use
and
reccommend
partsgeeks
to
everyone
I
know.
While
I
found
it
a
bit
difficult
to
find
the
part
I
needed
once
I
did
the
process
was
very
easy,
delivery
was
on
schedule.
I
haven't
had
time
to
install
the
part
yet,
so
can't
review
operation
of
part.
parts

the
place

the

awsome

With

I
always

Very

Great

They

The

The

No

Steam
has
been
a
huge
part
of
my
gaming
career.
I
have
over
400
games
on
steam
and
have
only
spent
$2,429.69.
That
is
an
average
of
FIFTEEN
CENTS
PER
GAME.
This
has
to
be
the
most
reputable
key
site
there
is.
All
keys
are
gathered
at
lower
prices
and
sold
to
us
better
than
even
steam
or
origin
can.
I
feel
very
comfortable
and
trust
CJ's
with
my
purchase.
Use
it
everyday!
Was
hoping
to
use
this
site
for
my
CD
key
purchases
but
the
site
says
isntant
delivery..
Never
got
it.
after
searching
online
for
a
good
deal
on
sunglasses
found
opticsfast.com
with
a
good
product
price
and
good
postage
rate.
You
advertise
online
that
the
Part
Number:
1007-04000375
fits
1999
BMW
328I.
However
the
part
was
not
even
the
same
shape
as
the
original
part.
You
say
that
this
is
not
a
good
reason
to
cover
the
return
cost!!!!
Hi,
I
got
exactly
what
I
wanted
at
the
right
price
in
double
quick
time
and
the
part
I
bought
does
exactly
what
I
wanted.
Nuff
said?
I
wondered
where
I
could
buy
parts
for
my
RV.
Great
resource.
This
was
our
second
experience
using
rebtel.
Our
first
was
perfect.
We
were
pleased
.
This
time
there
was
a
five
second

delay
after
each
time
we
talked.
We
hung
up
and
called
back
thinking
it
was
the
connection
but
the
problem
remained.
I
don't
know
if
it
was
because
of
rebtel
or
the
phone
company
but
it
was
annoying
either
way.
Backgrounds
and
character
profile
are
awesome!
You
get
what
you
ask
for
in
spades!
Totally
satisfied!
Not
the
best
overall
service.
Since
it
is
the
#1
social
network
however
with
all
their
take
it
or
leave
it
makeovers
and
the
serious
lack
of
privacy,
their
needs
to
better
privacy
settings,
and
the
possible
hacking
by
anonymous
it
does
raise
concerns
how
your
life
is
being
displayed
for
all
to
see.
Not
only
that
you
can
find
anything,
but
its
resources
and
apps
are
awesome.
I'm
always
satisfied
with
their
level
of
service
and
their
competitive
nature,
they
will
truly
provide
a
5%
discount
on
any
product
if
you
find
it
elsewhere
at
a
lower
price-
trust
me
I've
done
this!!
door
dat
de

My
favourite
brand
of
whisky
is
not
readily
available
in
shops.

Although
I
do
know
two
whisky
shops
where
I
can
buy
it,
one
is
in
Brighton
and
the
other
in
London....
and
I
live
in
neither
of
those
places.

It
is
therefore
refreshing
to
find
the
whisky
available
online.

The
ordering
was
easy,
the
delivery
speedy.

I
recommend
The
Whisky
Exchange.
This
is
a
great
company,
always
well
priced,
and
very
fast

No
local

could
find
the

that
I
wanted,
so
I
tried
Blackcircles
and
they
actually
had
them
in
stock.
A
couple
of
days
later
they
delivered
them
to
my
home.
Having
ordered
these
goods
on
16th
December
and
was
told
they
would
be
sent
out
first
class
post,
they
have
not
been
received
as
yet
so
very
disappointed
in
the
service.

We

I
would
say
its
the
most
reasonable
protein
around
especially
the
5kg
bag
and
its
good
quality
-
try
it,
there's
lots
of

to

from...
I
make
a
habit
of
searching
the
internet
for
the
best

Once
in
a

I
will
find
something
a
little
cheaper
with
another
company,
and

I
liked
the
idea
of
having
someone
to
contact
at
all
times
if
I
had
an

with
the

instead
of
dealing
with
the

gona

Bought
tyres
from
Kwik-Fit
online.
They
were
very
cheap
–
much
less
than
in
the
actual
Kwik-Fit
garage
and
much
cheaper
than
elsewhere
online.
As
I
ordered
2
tyres
it
meant
that
I
qualified
for
free
mobile
fitting
–
so
that's
what
I
did.
They
were
to
come
to
where
I
work
and
fit
them
for
me.
On
the
morning
of
the
fitting
I
realised
that
I
didn't
have
my
locking
nut
with
me
and
they
were
prepared
to
put
the
fitting
on
hold
until
it
was
next
convenient
for
me,
or
I
could
have
my
money
back
and
not
have
the
tyres
fitted.
I
thought
that
this
was
great
customer
service.
It
turned
out
that
the
car
I
was
in
did
not
need
a
locking
nut
after
all
(stupid
me),
and
they
came
later
in
the
day
to
fit
the
tyres
for
me.
Excellent
service,
cannot
fault
it
as
they
went
the
extra
mile.
Highly
recommended.
The
abilty
to
go
online
and
purchase
a
game
card
and
have
it's

less

2

is
amazing.
No
need
to
leave
home
and
drive
to
the
store
to
pick
up
a
card.
Just
hop
online
and
order
your
needed
game
at
pcgamesupply.com
and
have

two
minutes.
I'm
happy

and
even

I

From

the

and

have
been
second

even
when
the
weather
has
been
very
bad
my
orders
have
arrived
at
my
home
in
the
northeast
of
Scotland
on
time
with
no
delay.
I
cannot
fault
the
service
or
support
from
the
staff
at
Heinnie
and
have
reccomended
to
a
couple
of
friends
who
have
had
the
same
service.
They
substituted
a
lower
value
product,
drop-shipped
from
another
company,
instead
of
shipping
from
the
same
location
as
my
previous
purchase
(plenty
of
inventory
was
available
in
their
warehouse).
They
refused
to
refund
the
difference
and
insisted
that
I
pay
for
the
authorized
return,
which
would
have
cast
more
than
the
refund
I
requested.
There
were
plenty
of
highly

on

carrying
the

products
for

Itnwas

Ya'll
did
great
and
it
was
better

than
the
OEM.....please
place

I
ordered
a
heater
fan
blower
motor
for
an
Audi.

The
brand
name
appeared
to
be
German
and
the
box
had
sentences
written
in
German.

I
opened
the
box
and
found
the
motor
had
a
"Made
in
China"
sticker.
Found
it
through
Googling
for
the
products
I
was
looking
for,
prices
looked
good
and
then
I
discovered
the
service
was
also
excellent.
I
will
buy
from
OMC
whenever
they
have
the
items
I
am
looking
for.
Nothing
more
to
say
other
than
excellent
service.
I
was
needing
a
straightforward
breakdown
of
build
tools,
specifically
Maven.
VPP
has
a
very
inexpensive
course
on
build
tools
that
covers
Ant,
Maven,
and
Gradle
in
that
order.
I'm
working
my
way
through
the
course
right
now
and
am
about
halfway
through
the
Maven
section,
and
I
have
to
say
that
this
is
EXACTLY
what
I've
been
needing.
I
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
given
cost
as
a
factor,
this
is
much
better
than
a
live
class
setting.
And
the
best
part
is
THE
CODE
WORKS.
I've
been
using
a
lot
of
books

and
online
tutorials
in
my
studies,
and
half
of
the
time
the
code
simply
won't
work
because
of
some
miniscule,
undiscoverable
reason.
But
with
VPP,
he
really
helps
you
get
past
all
this
and
addresses
issues
you
might
run
into
as
you
code
along
with
him.
I
will
definitely
purchase
more
of
these
videos
when
I'm
done
with
this
course.
It's
a
shame
you
can't
get
on
the
internet
to
pick
up
a
few

that
the
local
parts
stores
can't
even
find
on
their

Travelocity
is
the
first
site
that
I
go
on
when
making
travel
arrangements.
I
have
found
great
deals
on
hotels,
car
rentals
and
air
accommodation.

The
site
is
easy
to
maneuver.
This
was
my
first
order
and
was
surprised
the

speed
of
delivery.

There
was
no
hassel
and
all
was
straight
forward
the
way
one
wants
and
expects.
I
was
trying
to
use
the
PC
lap
top
and
get
hotel
prices
and
every
one
gave
me
a
bad
time
trying
to
book
as
well
as
get
the
best
price,
but
your
site.

My
credit
card
went
right
through
and

I

was
ready
to
go
in
minutes.

This
I
was

unable
with
all
the
others.

I
highly
recommend
using
you
folks
always
from
now
on.
I
was
scanning
the
computer
for
Greenies
and
came
up
with
Chewy's
site.

I
called
as
it
was
getting
difficult
to
pull
up
the
iitem
and
size.

I
got
right
through
and

a
very
good
price
with
next
day
arrival
and
did
it
just
that.

It
arrived
ahead
of
time
and
with
a
good
price.

I'll
go
back
to
them
anytime.
Any
time
you
try
someone
or
someplace
new
you
tend
to
be
skeptical
,
but
hopeful.
In
this
case
my
first
experience
with
PartsGeek
was
a
great
one.
They
had
exactly
what
I
needed
and
for
a
fair
price.
Even
the
delivery
process
was
impressive.
The
shipping
department
did
a
great
job
of
updating
me
the
tracking
numbers
and
changes
to
the
schedule.
I
was
very
impressed
from
start
to
finish!
Highly
recommended.

It

until
I
was
well
into

all
became

There
was
no

this

to

promised.
Reasonable
prices,
easy
shipping,
no
hassle.
I
would
have
given
5

you
could

I
highly
recommend
using
this
service.

I
highly
recommend
this
company.
Great
prices.
Enough
said.
My
radiator
arrived
in
only
for
days
it
was
worth
waiting
a
few
days
to
replace
the
old
one
considering
the
money
I
saved.
If
you
have
a
dog
then
PetFlow.com
is
a
breeze
to
use.

I
have
cats,
and
since
the
site
switches
to
a
Dog
oriented
search
every
time
the
user
changes
pages,
life
is
difficult
for
those
who
want
to
purchase
things
for
cats.

I
have
to
re-select
the
Cat
category
repeatedly
to
do
my
shopping,
even
when
I
have
a
known
profile
and
PetFlow.com
knows
I
have
Cats.

This
should
be
an
easy
fix
to
gain
a
higher
rating,
but
at
this
point
I
feel
like
PetFlow
believes
that
Cats
(and
their
owners)
are
2nd
class
customers.
I
got
what
I
ordered
and
it
arrived
in
a
timely
fashion
in
excellent
condition.
Placed
order
on
Wednesday,
received
package
on
Saturday.

Price
was
30%
less
than
Amazon!

Would
definitely
purchase
again
from
tahoemountainsports.com
Very
good
service,
it
is
very
secure
and
provides
means
of
security
while
also
being
very
efficient.
Transaction
was
over
in
less
than
5
minutes
and
was
able
to
enjoy
the

as
quickly
as
that.
Thanks
again!
Thank
you
so
much.
I
was
not
worried
but
it
is
good
to
check
once
in
a
while
and
this
is
an
easy
way
of
doing
it.
Nothing
that
can
be
improved
to
be
honest.

I
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
buying
car

in
a
website
that's
called

I'm
glad
I
did
they
were
professional
in

will
definitely
buy
from
them

everything
I

This
was
the
first
order
I
had
placed
with
Market
Cross
and
was
extremely
satisfied
with
the
way
order
was
taken,
the
way
I
was
kept
informed
of
the
progress
i.e.
that
it
had
been
dispatched
and
the
delivery
date
was
kept
to.
Very
good
service
and
the
flowers
were
very
impressive.
Delivery
always
on

best

in

and
have
been
using
them
for
over

Whole
thing
was
a
good
experience
and
I
will
be
getting
more
in
the
future,
I
shall
be
recommending
TPW
to
as
many
people
as
I
can,
my
order
was
delivered
within
a
couple
of
days,
really
good
service
and
lower
prices
than
most
other
supplement
retailers.
I've
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
and
money
here
lately
They
said
it
was
a.exact
fit
for
my
truck.....not
even
close!there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
speak
with
them
either.not
only
does
part
not
fit
I
have
to
pay
to
ship
back
and
15%
restocking.will
never
use
them
again!you
will
never
speak
to
a
human.very
poor
customer
service.
Check
out
reviews.they
have
been
reported
to
the
BBB
a
bunch.
Extremely
happy
with
this
purchase
for
my
father-in-law.

Love
the
additions

(folder,
cards,
etc)
that
came
along
with
it.
Though
there
were
some
miscommunications
with
the
sales
associate,
the
technician
Joey
Militello
was
great
and
very
accommodating.

He
was
efficient
and
very
helpful.

I
appreciate
his
honesty
and
work
ethic.

We
moved
forward
with
the
contract
because
of
him
and
a
sales
manager
Dave.
The
first
delivery
was
a
mess,
the
flowers
possibly
packed
up
to
four
days
before
they
were
delivered
late.
Very
disappointed
with
that.
Then
it
took
a
while
to
convince
there
was
a
problem,
and
it
became
very
frustrating
with
the
need
to
repeatedly
insert
the
order
number
in
the
communications.
However,
all
worked
well
in
the
end,
and
the
replacement
flowers
were
wonderful
and
much
better
than
expected.
Thank
you
Senrenata.
You
have
redeemed
the
situation.
Not
only
was
the
price
right,
the
response
time
was
outstanding.
Less
than
24hrs
from
order
to
delivery.
If
you
want
quick
and
efficient
service
Merlin
is
the
place
to
go.
The
Christmas
backlog
must
have
affected
the
shipment.
However,
the
book
made
it
before
classes
resumed,
so
no
foul.

I
purchase

smartbuyglasses.ca,
I
received
my

pretty

I

all
times.
I'll
use

Just

to
your
lock-
they
will
hit
you
with
a
$50

I
have
been
using
this
company
for
4-5
years
now
and
have
never
had
cause

complain

Have
the
original
owners
sold
out?
Something
has
changed.
What
were
very
clear
and
simple
terms
have
now
been
made
complex
to
the
point
where
you
have
to
be
careful
that
what
you
think
you
are
booking
is
actually
what
you
will
get.

Regular

proceed
with
caution!

I
have
been
buying
from

for
over
20
years
and
been
very
happy
with
the
pricing
and
the
ability
to
talk
with
the
sales
people
and
techs
before
and
after
my
purchases.

My
first

You

I
contacted
your
company
and
asked
the
time
frame
we
would
be
looking
at
so
I
could
set
my
flight
schedule
.
I
was
to
fly
out
the
following
Wensday
,
I
had
to
get
my
yellow
fever
vacine
and
send
off
everything
to
them
fedex
that
day,
including
two
money
orders
for
50
dollars
to
Ghana
embassy
and
Diane
?.
So
I
sent
it
out
Wensday
with
my
prepaid
label.
It
was
received
Thursday
but
he
made
a
mistake
the
money
orders
were
suppose
to

be
for
60$
Ghana
40$
Diane
which
would
delay
everything
iset
the
the
money
orders
and
I
was
mad
as
hell
.
He
received
them
Friday
a
nd
got
it
offtothe
embassy
on
Friday.
To
change
my
flight
would
cost
me
aprx.
800$
more
and
I
was
very
worried
and
nervous.
I
got
a
call
from
Adam
that
my
visa
was
sent
out
that
night
and
should
be
here
in
the
afternoon
I
waited
and
waited

then
about
4
pm
I
got
notification
my
package
missed
the
currier
and
would
not
be
tome
till
after
my
flight
left.
After
a
lot
of
calls
they
located
where
it
was
and

I
had
little
time
to
find
the
place
and
get
my
package.
I
got
there
the
lady
at
FedEx
was
nice
enough
to
look
for
it
before
she
went
home
and
I
got
it.
This
all
should
of
never
happened

and
I
feel
a
big
apology
is
needed,
also
your
people
need
to
be
accurate
I
telling
us
what
is
needed
for
this.
In
many
ways
I
paid
for
this
mistake
lots
a
extra
driving
worry
,
etc.
The
tour
was
great,
but
traffic
can
be
a
major
negative
issue.

Be
prepared
to
get
great
pictures
and
also
do
a
lot
of
walking.

The
ride
was
great
and
I
would
do
it
again!
Every
experience
with
shipsticks
has
exceeded
my
expectation.
I
know
there
is
a
little
anxiety
with
the
thought
"what
happens
if
the
don't
show".
Take
my
word
for
it
the
first
time
I
scheduled
my
clubs
for
pick
up
(
shipped
to
Scottsdale,
AZ)
I
was
nervous!
But
the
folks
at
shipsticks
answered
every
email
and
phone
call
in
a
timely
fashion
and
reassured
me
each
time.
I
received
notifications
every
step
and
was
able
to
track
on-line
which
helped
my
relax!
I
will
continue
to
utilize
this
service
and
would
encourage
everyone
to
do
the
same.
You'll
be
glad
you
did.
What
an
amazing
experience
dealing
with
this
professional
company.
Nothing
was
too
much
trouble
to
accommodate.
Emails
were
responded
to
immediately

provided.
Many

were

When
I
purchased
an
engagement
ring
for
my
fiancee,
I
knew
very
little
about
diamonds
or
rings
in
general.

The
website
gave
me
an
in
depth
knowledge
of
everything,
and
the
customer
service
was
fantastic!

It
was
great
to
actually
talk
to
a
gemologist
on
the
phone.

Not
only
was
the
service
great,
but
I
was
able
to
get
a
very
high
quality
ring
at
a
much
lower
price
than
any
retail
store.

I
highly
recommend
this
site
to
everyone!
They
always
have
the
cheapest
supplements
and
that's
why
I
shop
online.
They
are
so
much
cheaper
then
GNC
and
they
also
have
a
great
variety
of
supplements
that
most

around

don't
have.
Quick

don't
know,
that's
what
came
up
most,
but
bottom
line
is
I
got
a
unit.
Great
selection
of
products
available.
If
you
can
find
it
cheaper
at
some
other
website
they
will
price
match
it.
Easy

use
quick

I
travel
somewhat
often
and
when
i
do
i
always
check
priceline
first
and
then
I'll
compare
other
sites
to
priceline
and
find
that
priceline
always
has
the
best
deals
and
prices!
I
speak
for
myself
but,
I
would
never
back
anything
or
service
I
wouldn't
tell
a
family
member
or
friend
to
use.
This
is
a
great
way
to
try
new
espresso
blends.

I
have
only
belonged
to
their
espresso
subscription
service
for
a
few
months
but
so
far
every
batch
of
beans
they
have
sent
me
has
been
superb!
One
stop
shopping.
Fair
and
honest
pricing.
Service
second
to

'Nuff
said.
I
ordered
a
set
of
headlights
for
my
2001
Pontiac
Grand
Prix.
Partsgees
shipped
me
one
headlight
and
a
tailight
from
an
unknown
vehicle.
I
opened
a
support
ticket
within
three
days
of
receiving
the
part.
I
received
the
auto-generated
response
saying
I
would
be
contacted
by
customer
service.
Eventually
I
was
contacted,
and
asked
to
provide
some
information,
which
I
did.
This
went
on
for
about
three
weeks
as
it
seemed
that
everytime
I
sent
an
e-mail,
it
was
read
by
a
different
individual
who
was
not
familiar
with
my
issue,
and
the
whole
process
started
over
again.
I
also
sent
two
telephone
number
where
I
could
be
reached,
along
with
the
best
time
to
reach
me,
and
did
not
receive
a
call.
I
received
an
e-mail
saying
that
someone
attempted
to
call,
but
they
did
not
leave
a
message
or
a
return
number,
so
I
have
no
idea.
I
sent
pictures
of
the
item,
and
a
copy
of
my
invoice
twice,
explaining
what
happened,
including
the
wrong
part
received,
and
the
part
that
I
was
supposed
to
receive.
I
even
included
the
part
numbers,
all
to
no
avail.

I
had
to
open
multiple
support
tickets
just
to
get
a
status
on
the
previous
ticket.
Looked
around
and
got
a
great
price
from
Multitrip.
Had
to
make
a
claim
a
few
weeks
ago
and
they
could
not
have
made
the
process
easier
or
been
more
accommodating.
Just
signed
up
for
another
year.
Dude,
you
need
to
check
out
this
site
I
found!
The
price
was
almost
half
of
everyone
else
and
the
part
was
on
my
door
step
in
2
days!
All
the
information
about
the
item
I
bought
was
accurate
and
during
the
delivery
period
I
ask
them
for
additional
info
that
was
answered
promptly.
I
was
sent
the
wrong
part
and
realized
it
when
they
sent
me
the
confirmation
so
I
immediately
called
to
cancel
before
it
was
even
sent.

It
was
impossible
to
get
through
on
their
phone
system
so
after
holding
many
times
for
20
minutes
or
longer
the
voice
comes
back
and
says
go
to
the
web
site
and
log
in
and
someone
will
call
you
back

in
24hrs.

Well
24
hrs
went
by
and
no
call
in
fact
10
days
went
by
with
no
calls.
They
did
send
me
a
reference
number
and
the
problem
was
I
could
not
send
the
product
back
since
they
shipped
it
anyway
without
a
RMA
#
or
they
would
not
refund
my
money.

Since
I
could
not
get
anyone
to
call
me
back
or
issue
me
a
RMA
#
I
sent
it
back
anyway
since
I
was
worried
about
the
30
day
window
to
return
it
and
I
am
hoping
they
will
still
give
me
a
refund.

I
literally
was
on
there
phone
for
many
hours
and
many
days
at
least
25
times
with
no
response.

So
if
you
are
buying
something
from
them,

You
better
get
a
RMA#
in
advance
just
in
case
you
need
to
return
your
product.

Geek

more
people
to
handle
all
their
customer
service
issues
if
they
want
to
stay
in
business
and

I
will
no
longer
be
buying
anything
from
them
ever
again.

was
a
great
result
for
me.
My
oven
door
was
not
closing
properly
resulting
in
loss
of
heat
and
inconsistent
cooking.
Other
than
replace
the

I
decided
to
try
the
magnets.
My
first
attempt
with
a
neodymium
was
temporarily
successful
but
lost
some
magnetism
over
time.
First
class
and
easily
accessible
advice
from
First4magnets
solved
the
problem
and
were
able
to
supply
me
with
suitable
high
temperature
resistance
magnets.
Now
looking
at
other
areas
for
magnet
use
like
my
fuel
flap
on
my
car
which
has
a
broken
catch.

Having
ordered
from
Inkfarm
was
a
new
experience.
Son
referred
us
to
this
outlet.
Wife
had
ordered
ink
for
her
laptop
system
and
was
pleased.
I
have
now
loaded
one
of
the
color
cartridge
but
is
too
soon
to
determine
ouput.
The
cartridge
did
leak
a
little,
but
that
was
my
fault.
Using
your
outlet
savewd
me
money.
Purchased

I
would

I
saved

useful.
I
use
it
for

Recommend
it
to
anyone
traveling
in
Europe.
Too
bad
about
the
noxious

but
that
is
a
European
and
French
problem.

I
am
very
grateful
that
you

such
an
extensive

of

for
my
Senseo
coffee
brewer.
The
ordering
was
very
easy
and
fun!
In
one
word,
"EXCELLENT"
service.
.
The
only
issue
I
have
is
that
I
always
end
up
with
a
car
from
Europcar.

I
know
and
understand
that
Europcar
offers
the
best
deals
but
I
rarely
have
a
trip
without
a
problem
(I
go
on
average
twice
a
year
to
Belgium).

When
I
mentioned
my
concern
once
to
a
service
rep
of
Auto
Europe
I
was
told
they
could
send
me
to
another
agency
but
at
a
much
higher
rate
...
that
year
I
ended
up
looking
for
another
solution
on
the
internet,
I
rented
from
a
UK
based
agency
and
got
a
great
deal
with
Hertz.

I
still
rent
from
Auto
Europe
but
I
do
like
the
option
with
some
other
agencies
that
let
you
know
right
away
from
whom
you
are
renting
and
if
there
is
no
big
price
difference
the
choice
gets
easier.

I
did
recommend
Auto
Europe
to
friends
and
they
are
happy
with
the
service.

Overall
a
very
good
company
to
deal
with.
Quick
service,
as
advertised.
Perfect
fit.
Great

Easy
to
find

the

I
ordered
the
sizing
was
way
off.
bought
two
RAB
items.
A
jacket
and
pull

the
size
variation
between
the

was
bad.
Not
the
fault
of
Rock

Run
but
with
RAB
and
its
sizing.
The
infinity
jacket
is
huge.
Package
was
a
large
box
(125cm)
containing
a
guitar.
Weight
was
7kg
but
most
companies
-
e.g.
Parcelforce,
DHL
etc
-
applied
a
'volumetric
weight'
formula
that
increased
it
to
28kg!

ParcelHero
did
not
and
charged
£51
compared
to
£100+
from
other
companies.

It
arrived
safely
within
4
days,
2
days
earlier
than

Will
definitely
use
again.

pleased
with

it

You
claim
they
are
powerful

and
I
was
not
disappointed.
We
dropped

with
the
super
magnet
I
found
them
in
no
time
saving
us
a
big
bill
for

The
only
problem
is,
now
the
kids
want
an
even
bigger
super
strength
magnet!

We
love
that
they

that

Used
Blackcircle.com
as
it
was
a
partner
for
the
CSMA

and
was
easy
from
the
start.
I
had
a
couple
of
tyre
specs
in
mind
and
was
unsure
which
would
be
best,
but
a
quick
call
to
Blackcircle
and
a
chat
with
one
of
their
agents
resolved
that
query
quickly.

all
the

then
went

before
a

I
recommned
this

PetFlow.com
is
a
fabulous
service
and
I
couldn't
be
happier.
It
always
seemed
like
I
was
heading
to
the
Vet
to
get
food.

It
never
failed,
the
food
bin
is
empty
and
the
dogs
are
looking
at
me
like
I'm
slacking
on
my
job.

Now,
their
food
shows
up
at
my
door
right
when
I
need
it
and
the
dogs
will
always
be
happy,
me
too!

I
highly
recommend
PetFlow
to
everyone,
I

I
met
Hank
and
reviewed
different
options
for
summer
tires
for
my
2010
Prius.

I
made
my
selection
and
called
back
to
make
an
appointment
to
have
my
dedicated
snow
swapped
out
for
the
new
tires.
As
always,
quick
delivery
&
everything
in
perfect
condition
when
it
arrived,
wouldn't
expect
anything
less.
Shuttle
service
to
and
from
the
airport
was
very
efficient.

It
had
snowed
on
our
returned
and
the
car
was
cleaned
off
when
we
got
to
the
lot.

Overall,
very
good
experience.
I
have
used
a
few
times
in
the
past
for
various
bits
of
equipment
and
the
service
is
also
quick
and
reliable.

The
pricing
is
fair
and
well
balanced
against
the
quality
of
the
product.
Supplement
Warehouse

So,
I
stumbled

the
site.
I
payed
for
my
SW:TOR
with
paypal
and
was
flagged
with
the
first

anti
fraud
thing.

I
thought
it
was
weird,
so
I
scanned
my
passport
(with
everything
but
my
name
and
photo
blanked
out)
and
my
credit
card
statement
(with
everything
but
my
address
blanked
out.

I
ordered
the
game
at
like
midnight,
and
send
in
the
follow
up
email
before
1am.

I
had
the
game
by
10am.

I
think
thats
pretty
awesome

I
would
recommend
this
company
anytime.
they
are
very
fair
and

reasonable.
The
product
was
just
what
I
wanted
and
it
fit
my
car
perfectly.
I
actually
recieved
my
order
in
very
good
timing.
I
have
purchased
many
items
from
B&H
and
I
trust
them
to
deliver
the
best
products
at
the
best
price
and
fast
service
I've
always
had
good
experiences
with
Merlin
Cycles
and
they
always
keep
in
touch
if
you
have
any
questions
or
problems.
They
know
their
stuff
as
well,
with
good
advice
on
offer.
I
have
used
to
buy
Ultimate

in
three

I
already
spent
about
£500
British
pounds
and
I
never
had
a

pcgamesupply.com

I'll

Parts
came
fast
and
worked
like
a
charm.
Between
still
photo
and
video,
after
I
check
all
other
Web
sellers,
I
go
to
B&H
to
purchase.

I
have
been
a
B&H
Customer
since
forever
and
I
have
yet
to
file
a
complaint
of
any
kind.
This
company
delivers
sooo
good

and
the
sell
the
sickest
stuff
there
can
be
found
for
snowboarding,
skateboarding,
and
all
other
cool

The
rental
procedure
was
quite
fast
and
I
got
a
car
with
lots
of
damages
(also
it
had
ony
3500km).
It
made
me
quite
nervous

but
when
I
returned
it
it
was
no
problem.
I
simply
LOVE
Cult
Pens.
I'd
safely
say
they
are
my
best
online
store
discovery
since
I
first
went
online
over
a
decade
ago,
I
exaggerate
not!
I'm
an
artist
and
perhaps
you
could
say
have
more
than
a
functional
interest
in
good
pens
and
the
importance
of
making
the
perfect
mark.
Cult
Pens
have
the
most
amazing
stock,
coupled
with
great
prices.
Their
freebies
are
most
appreciated
too.
Do
yourself
a
favour
and
buy
some
pens.......
Perfect
service.
Use
them.
Apartment
just
as
described,
great
value,
easy

will
definitely
use
them
again!

After
10
years
of
building
and
cleaning
computers
the
first
order
of
business
is
to
secure
them
with
Avast
anti-virus.
depending
on
how
contaminated
they
are,
most
of
the
time
a
boot
time
scan
will
do
the
job,
but
occasionally
it
will
take
the
Avast
rescue
disc,
I
recommend
Avast
Internet
security
to
every
computer
owner
when
I
have
cleaned
there
machine,
fortunately
the
free
version
does
an
excellent
job.
I've
been
after
a
new
pair
of
running
shoes
for
ages.

I
went
to
a
specialist
sports
shop
but
they
were
unable
to
offer
me
a
running
shoe
that
would
stop
the
heel
hitting
my
sensitive
Achilles
heel.


It
was
much
easier
to
get
online
and
use
Millet
sports
who
delivered
me
the
most
recent
model
of
the,
"Brooks
Beast".

It
would
have
saved
me
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
if
I
had
done
this
at
first
and
I
will
be
using
millet
sports
as
well
as
recommending
them.
They
have
everything
for
almost
every
car
on
the
planet
!
very
reasonable
prices
too..
On
my
first
booking
there
was
going
to
be
a
delay
with
the
tyres
I
got
a
phone
from
here
as
a
gift
from
my
girlfriend
but
I
preferred
another
color
so
I
called
the
company
up
to
do
an
exchange
and
was
pleased
at
how
smoothly
things
went.

I
will
definitely
consider
them
for
any
future
cell
phone-related
purchases
I
make!
The
Quidco
concept
is
excellent
but
it
does
not
function
as
well
as
it
used
to.
Despite
the
tracking
banner
(A
great
idea)
more
often
than
not
it
doesn't
track.
What
we
need
is
some
confirmation
(it
used
to
be
an
email)
after
the
purchase
that
tracking
is
set.
More
often
than
not
it
doesn't
track
and
you
have
to
create
a
"ticket"
which
frankly
if
it's
a
couple
of
Quid
it's
not
worth
the
effort.
The
0800
phone
number
was
answered
promptly,
my
order
was
placed
and
it
arrived
the
next
day.
It
could
not
have
been
better.
Thank
you
DIO.
The
speed
at
which
I
got
my
code
was
almost
I
stabt
and
I
like
that
feature
to
prevent
theft
it's
great
I'll
get
more
stuff
next
month
keep
doing
what
u
guys
do
Nothing
but
impressed
and
thankful
for
Supplement
Wharehouse!
The
only
regret
I
have
is
that
I
didn't
know
about
them
earlier!
The
supplement
prices
are
the
best
I've
seen
(in
stores
or
on
the
internet),
I
got
so
much
more
for
my
money.
The
website
ROCKS,
info
on
top
of
info
with
even
more
info
about
the
products
I
was
interested
in
buying.
Fast
shipping
with
GREAT
communication
keeping
me
updated
on
the
status
of
my
order!
THANK
YOU
I'd
use
them
the
next
time.
I
ordered
the
Berkline
theatre
chairs
and
am
very
pleased
with
the
quality
of
the
product
for
the
cost.
I
was
looking
to
buy
a
Breitling
and
checked
out
various
sites
and
found
that
the
majority
of
them
despite
saying
the
watches
were
in
stock
were
saying
delivery
between
4-8
weeks
for
delivery.
Supplement
Warehouse
is
the
best
in
the
supplement
business,
I
used
to
get
my
supplements
here
locally
from
GNC,
Complete
Nutrition
and
even
Vitamin
World
until
I
found
Supplement
Warehouse.

The
prices
and
the
supplement
choices
were
unbelievable!!

The
prices
beat
all
the
local
competition
by
a
land
slide!!
That's
including
shipping!!

I'm
never
going
back
to
GNC
or
any
of
them
again.
I
tell
all
my
workout
buddies
about
Supplement
Warehouse
to
get
their
supplements.

I'm
very
happy
with
the
prices,
choices,
shipping,
and
the
deals!!
I'm
a
life
long
member!!
I
bought
a
psn
20
usd
card
and
i
had
quick
response
from
game
suppy.
No
major
problems
It
was
pretty
easy
to
order
what
i
needed
and
got
shipped
quick.
I
would
order
more
products
in
the
future
I
ordered
a
new
washing
machine
on
Thursday
evening
and
booked
a
free
Saturday
delivery
to
save
taking
a
day
off
work.
I
was
woken
at
7.00am
with
an
automated
message
telling
me
that
I
would
get
my
delivery
between
7.00
and
11.00.
They
are
also
very
responsive
if
there
are
issues
or
concerns,
and
flexible
with
regard
to
special
requests.
Got
my
gear
quickly.

Rang

late
one
afternoon
on
advice
for
a

part
for
my
Galaxy
Aqua
1000
shower.
The
assistant
was
very
helpful
and
didn't
try
to
sell
me
something
I
didn't
need.
Ordered
the
sopare
part
about
4.30pm
one
afternoon
-
the
next
day
it
arrived
by
mail!
How's
that
for
super
fast
efficiency.
Highly
recommended.
Availability,
service,
goodwill
and
altogether
great
experience
unparalleled
in
the
audiovisual
field.
I
love

:(
After
countless
emails
to
both
MY
protein
and
their
delivery
clowns,
My
order
eventually
found
its
way
to
me
over
6
weeks
after
being
ordered
!
I
found
out,via
the
only
phone
call
I
received
from
them
,that
my
order
had
been
delivered
to
my
address
previously
and
signed
on
my
behalf
for
BY
THE
DELIVERY
COMPANY!!
I
was
at
work
(
I
work
shifts
and
we
sign
in
and
out
and
did
not
come
home
until
nearly
3
hours
after
it
was
delivered)
and
nobody
was
home,yet
my
name
was
on
the
delivery
sheet.
But
there
was
no
delivery
and
it
was
not
left
with
any
body
else,
although
they
did
suggest
that
I
try
all
my
neighbors.

Any
way
got
my
protein
in
the
end.

After

sending
a
letter
of
complaint
to
MY
PROTEIN,
I
was
sent
a
code
giving
me
20%
off
my
next
order,
which
I
thought
,fair
enough
I'll
use
that
now
,before
VAT
get
stuck
on
the
price...The
code
was
rejected

!
you
can't
go
wrong
with
'copy
paste'
so
I
tried
again
,rejected
again.
Emailed
MY
PROTEIN
..AGAIN,,they
emailed
back,
apologized,
and
said
they
would
sort
it
out
and
have
it
working
by
12pm
the
following
day.OK
the
following
day
tried
again,It
still
did
not
work
!
baring
in
mind
how
long
it
takes
to
complete
the
order
on
line,
only
for
it
to
fail
each
time..A
new
email
has
been
sent
to
them
2
days
ago
,
suggesting
how
their
'Customer
Services'

could
be

'enhanced'
.
I
am
still
waiting
for
a
reply..
so
yes
when
all
is
going
well
and
your
items
turn
up
great,
but
when
things
go
wrong..expect
nothing
but
Indigestion..
check
the
small
print.
my
protein
say
they
are
not
liable
for
products
not
delivered
to
you,
once
the
parcel
has
left
their
depot.
I
tracked
my
last
parcel
,
and
it
said
it
was
delivered
and
signed
for

at
a
certain
time
of
day,
when
in
fact
I
was
at
work
!
No
parcel
and
a
forged
signature
!
I
ordered
a
part,
and
then
was
informed
that
it
was
their
policy
not
to
ship
to
an
alternate
shipping
address.
I'm
on
the
road,
and
needed
the
part
where
I
was.
When
I
brought
this
to
their
attention,
I
was
told,
ok,
we'll
gladly
cancel
your
order.
Not
even
a
"Sorry
for
the
inconvenience".
I
know
companies
have
policies,
but
I've
never
seen
a
company
so
uncaring
about
how
its
customers
feel.
I
guess
in
this
age
you
can
get
away
with
that.

Not

I
thought
the
price
was
very
good
and
the
delivery
was
fast
and
just
in
time
for
my
Miss
Pudys'
next
feeding!
She
liked
it
very
much
and
even
asked
for
seconds,
which
She
usually
dose
not
get,
but
for
a
special
treat
and
because
She
asked
so
nicely,
I
gave
Her
some!
I
use
them
in
the
exercise

and
in
the

to

sleep
on.

I

IT

THE

TIME
A
PART
CAME
IN
BAD
AND
I
HAD
TO
MAKE
AN
ALTERATION
TO
MAKE
IT
FIT
KNOWING
I
WOULD
LOSE
MY
RETURN
POLICY.
I
HAD
MY
GARAGE
TIED
UP
AND
COULD
NOT
WAIT
TO
SEND
IT
BACK.
Part
was
ordered
8/4/12,
received

UPS

So
I

on

the

to

I
could

Not
only
that,
within
minutes
of

it
was

and
I
received
an

with
a

Cheaper
than

with,
the

is
excellent.
For
comparison,
the

I
ordered
a
product
from
this
company
and
after
an
e-mail
was
assured
it
would
be
delivered
that
day
I
write
this
3
days
later
and
I
have
still
not
receved
my
order,I
will
carry
on
the
unnecessary
fight
to
get
my
products
or
my
money
back-it
really
is
a
headache
nobody
needs
there
are
so
many
other
companies
out
there
which
will
give
me
better
service.
Good
price
and
delivered
as
expected.
Like
all
true
gamers
out
there
I
must
have
the
new

on
the
day
of

That's
why
I
only
buy
games
from
shopto.net
without
fail
I
have
received
all
orders
on
the
release

and
with
any

my

arrive
as
one
of
the

ontime.

We
really
enjoyed
our
stay
at
Debbie's.
It
was
a
great
base
for
visiting
New
York
and
was
situated
about
a
10-15
minute
walk
away
from
the
Subway
(Nostrand
Station
-
tip

a
MetroCard
to
save
many
$$$).
Debbie
made
us
really
welcome.
The
apartment
was
spacious
and
comfortable
with
a
good-sized
kitchen
with
all
the
necessary
appliances.

Thanks
Debbie.
The
radiator
fit
very
well
in
my

It
shipped
very
quickly
and
I
would
do
business
with
them
again.
Thank
you
Priceline,
you
have
saved
me
not
only
a
lot
of
money,
but
thanks
to
your
EXCELLENT
customer
service,
you
helped
fix
a
major
error
on
my
part
thus
saving
my
surprise
trip
to
propose
to
my
girlfriend!
She
said
yes,
the
trip
was
wonderful!!!
Another
Priceline
booked
trip
later
and
we
are
now
a
happily
married
couple!
Just
had
a
water
leak
in
my
basement
-
threw
away
$1200
worth
of
ruined
soaked
carpet.

I
was
looking
for
a
product
that
would
be
soft
underfoot
for
my
kids
to
play
on
but
also
spill
resistant,
waterproof,
and
look
good.

These
tiles
are
incredible.

Interlocking
-
easy
to
install,
economical.

Now
I'm
not
worried
if
I
happen
to
get
water
again
I
simply
lift
the
mat
up
-
let
it
dry
and
lay
it
back
down!
Impressed
with
everything.
Have
bought
from
you
before.
I
have

arranged
a
replacement
and
shipped
it
that
day
with
no

asked,
best

service!
As
a
software
developer,
I
really
appreciate
the
quality
of
work
gone
into
this
website.
The
user
experience
is
unparalleled
-
will
highly
recommend
to
my
friends.
Very
good,
used

now
for
at
least

a

My
stay
at
Vietnam
Inn
Saigon
has
been
a
very
delightful
and
comfortable
experience.
The
hostel
itself
is
very
newly
furnished,
very
clean
and
conveniently
located
in
central
Saigon
near
shops,
restaurants,
cafes...
There
were
no
troubles
or
hassles
during
my
stay,
and
the
hostel's
staff
were
all
very
understanding,
presentable,
friendly
and
spoke
fluent
English.
Their
customer
servicing
is
very
commendable.
The
hostel's
facilities
and
utilities
are
made
very
much
available
to
us.
I
made
full
use
of
the
bar,
billiards
table,
free
internet
access
(wifi)
and
the
hostel's
restaurant
which
served
delicious,
authentic
Vietnamese
dishes
as
well
as
Western
dishes.
The
hostel
gives
you
peace
of
mind
over
the
security
of
your
valuables
through
the
availability
of
lockers
which
you
can
make
full
use
of.
Never
again
would
you
have
to
worry
about
your
valuables
being
lost
or
stolen!
I
without
a
doubt
recommend
this
hostel
to
anyone
who
desires
their
stay
in
Saigon
to
be
relaxing,
comfortable
and
worry
free.
Very
quick
delivery
and
communication
was
great.
I'll
definitely
buy
from
them
again.

MY

I
had
a
problem
with
a
shower
that
dripped
when
it
was
supposed
to
be
completely
turned
off.
As
it
was
an
old
item
I
was
doubtful
if
I
would
be
able
to
get
the
parts,
let
alone
fix
it.
I
found
Shower
Doctor
through
a
google
search
and
found
that
although
the
parts
for
my
shower
were
'obsolete',
they
could
still
provide
me
with
the
parts
and
apparently
instructions
on
how
to
fit
them.
The
parts
arrived
the
next
day
with
excellent
instructions
and
I
fitted
them
all
with
no
problem.
I
now
have
a
shower
that
stays
off
when
I
turn
it
off
and
had
no
plumber
bills
to
pay.

The

at

looking
as
good
as
ever.
For
the

they
are
excellent
value,
keeping
their
understated
and
quality
looks
for
ever,
years
after
the

Always
buy
the

are

taken.

A
quick
trawl
through
the

pointed
me
towards
the

chainsaw,
which
I
ordered

had

the

It
had
been
assembled
and
was
all
ready
to

Very
pleased
with
the
company
and
will
use
again.
Being
a
novice,
the

is
particularly
helpful
by
splitting
items
into

Only

I
was

cheaper
than

Pet
Stores.
very
efficient
Full
marks
to
DigitalRev
who
offered
a
very
good
price
for
a
DSLR
camera
I
bought.
Promptly
despatched,
although
DHL
did
take
one
day
longer
than
they
should
have
at
the
UK
end.
This
was
due
to
them
not
being
able
to
complete
all
deliveries
in
the
round
given
&
the
item
returned
back.
There
just
fast
and
easy,
no
reason
to
go
anywhere
else.
Good
service
and
quick
delivery
of
all

Brilliant
Service.

Use

to
book
anything
from

to

and
I
have
never
had
an
issue
even
when
booking
from
their
iPhone
app!
Brilliant!
The
process
for
the
booking
was
easy.
As
it
was
recommended
by
Trip
Advisor
I
thought
it
was
a
good
site
to
be
using.
There
were
a
few
minor
problems
with
communication
and
the
booking
process
after
the
booking
was
handed
over
the
the
owner
of
the
apartment.
It
was
nothing
major
and
was
to
do
with
payment
methods,
no
extra
cost
was
incurred
but
it
did
require
some
emailing
between
myself
and
the
apartment
owner
to
clarify
the
issues
which
was
more
of
a
hassle
that
could
have
been
simply
avoided
had
only
apartments
and
the
apartment
provider
share
this
information
to
be
placed
on
the
site.
I
am
very
please
to
find
very
reasonable

that
tend
to
be
pricy
elsewhere
Product
arrived
next
day,
as
per
usual
Good
prices
and
friendly
customer
service.

However,
my
cans
of
dog/cat
food
usually
come
dented
from
poor
packaging.

I've
called
about
this
twice,
they
kindly
assure
me
they
will
resolve
this
with
the
packagers,
but
it
never
makes
a
difference
to
the
actual
packaging.

I
currently
just
assume
some
cans
will
be
dented
and
they
usually
are.
Specifically
used
this
to
get
cash
back
from
Greenflag
but
got
nothing.

Just
goes
through
lists
of
questions
everytime
you
try
to
find
out
why
it
has
not
come
through.
I

The

arrived
within
3
days.

It
looks
good
on
the

in
my
spare
bedroom
ready
for
guests.
I
was
amazed
at
the
speed
with
which
my
order
was
processed
and
was
delighted
with
my
pack
of
20mm
diameter
magnetic
discs.

They
are
ideal
for
my
casualty
bases
for
my
hobby
of
wargaming.
I
would
easily
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
Auto
Europe's
website
was
very
easy
to
use.

Comparatively
they
had
great
prices
for
very
nice
vehicles.

We
were
able
to
get
everything
that
we
needed.

Also,
the
GPS
rental
service
was
very
convenient.
I
was
able
to
purchase
my
item
for
less
than
the
normal
retail
price
and
was
particularly
impressed
with
the
level
of
customer
service
I
received
from
the
tennis
nuts
staff.
The
staff
were
very
helpful
and
accommodating
and
resolved
any
issues
to
my
complete
satisfaction.
The
item
was
delivered
the
next
day
so
again
I
was
vet
impressed
with
the
speed
of
delivery.
i
have
ordered
a

of

from

have
never

have
a

of
different
things
you
can
shop
for
that
you
can't
find
anywhere

Fast

I
bought
the

the
result
of
a

They

When
I
removed
the
silver
protective
strip,
ink
leaked
out,
onto
our
new
carpet.

It
took
a
lot
of
cleaning
to
get
the
ink
out
of
our
carpet.

Also,
once
I
installed
the
new
color
cartridge,
my
printer
will
not
print
in
black
and
white
mode,
only
in
color

I
ordered
a

and

I
tracked

and
it
showed
movement.
The

in
Malvern,

by

on
2/24/2014
it
was
destroyed

thrown

I
found
that
it

Not

My

by

(you
can't
talk
to
a

They
were
trying
to
send
a
pickup
call
tag
for
the
damage
I
have
not
received.
We
finally
got
parts
geek
to
understand
the
problem.
They
credited
my
account
and
sent
an
email
saying
if
I
wated
to
re-order
the
part,
shipping
would
be
free.
I
replied
Yes
to
re-order
the
part.
I
recieved
another
email
to
call
customer
service
and
was
given
an
extension
number.
After
trying
to
call
five
different
times
I
have
yet
been
able
to
talk
to
anyone.
I
sent
them
another

to

and
the

service
is
amazing.

Have
been
thrilled
with
all
our
orders,
the
art
work,
the
execution,
the
speed.
The
product
arrived
in
about
seven
days
after
the
order
was
placed.

Ordering
and
the
shipping
were
quite

acceptable
experiences.

The
cartridges
were
full,
quite
unlike
the
HP
products(that
cost
more
than
twice
as
much)
they
replaced.

Other
than
the
nagging
printer
message
that
I
"don't
have
HP
cartridges
installed",
the
printer
works
fine
and
the
colors
are
consistent
with
what
I
expect.

I
would
recommend
INKfarm
to
anyone
looking
to
get
a
good
product
and
save
a
few
bucks.

very
pleased
with

Bought
2
shock

absorbers
at
a
great

price,
but
I
have
one
observation:

it
was
difficult
to
determine
that
I
had
correctly
identified
the
rear
shocks
that
I
wanted.

Simple
addition
(repitition
?)
of
'front'
on
struts
and
'rear'
on
shocks
would
have
made
my
purchase
experience
more
relaxed
and
me
more
confident
in
my
purchase!

Thanks
for
listening..
It
was
quick,
exactly
what
I
ordered
and
friendly.
The
only
negative
was
the
website
is
a
bit
hard
to
navigate.
They
shipped
on

and
communicated
status
at
all
times.
I
have
experienced
with
3
small

to
be
used

The
attention
received
for
these
small
purchases
gives
me
confidence
that
the
sensitivity
displayed
would
be
there
for
large
purchases.
The
experience
was
easy,
fast
and
a
great
value.

Order
and
received
my
products
quickly
and
the
price
was
the
lowest
I
could

I
ordered
the

got
them,
they
work
well,
and
I
will
come
back
to
order
from

(okay,
a
bit
of
hyperbole).

It
showed
up
in
no
time
with
no
issues

and

not
a

As

that
was
the
FREE
delivery
option.
Would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone.
Need
to
have
a
drop
down
window
that
holds
vehicle
identity.

That
way
every
time
I
visit
the
site
I
can
select
which
vehicle
I'm
searching
parts
for.

Don't
have
to
input
data
each
time
I
visit
the
site.
got
a
shower
at
a
brilliant
price
which
was
well
below
other
retailers,well
happy,got
here
within
two
days(on
standard
shipping),really
happy
with
whole
service,job
done!:)
My
order
was
accurate
and
came
fairly
quickly
once
it
was
processed,
but
this
company
holds
all
orders
for
3
business
days
before
processing
it.
They
say
it's
for
'My
Safety"
but
in
reality
it's
just
there
to
cover
their
own
rear-ends,
not
mine.
If
someone
steals
my
credit
card
info
and
places
an
order
with
10dollarmall,
then
that
would
be
the
only
time
it
benefits
me
and
the
likely-hood
of
that
scenario
occurring
is
not
too
strong.
I
will
probably
not
order
from
this
company
again,
but
at
least
I
got
what
I
paid
for
eventually
and
it
was
accurate
and
new
as
stated
on
the
product
listing.
I've
looked
around
on
the
web
for
photo
equipment
but
haven't
found
a
site
I
like
better
for
selection
of
equipment
and
prices.

Free
shipping
makes
a
difference
too.

The
web
page
is
well
laid
out
and
makes
it
easy
to
find
the
item
I
want.

I'm
sure
I'll
be
back.
Biketiresdirect's
reasonable
prices
and
good
service
has
made
it
the
first
place
I
look
whenever
I'm
in
the
market
for
cycling
gear.

I've
ordered
from
them
several
times
and
have
never
been
disappointed.
Cms
is
the
first
place
I
check

to
locate
vintage
parts,
I
have
had
nothing
but
positive
experiences
with
them
and
will
continue
to
do
business
with
them.
I
only
hope
they
follow
David
Silvers'
example
and
open
a
second
outlet
in
the
states,
if
not
only
so
I
could
apply
for
a
job
there!
made
the
mistake
of
purchasing
the
wrong
product
and
after
a
lot
of
emails
i
figured
out
I
got
the
wrong
thing.
They
refunded
my
money
which
I
am
happy
for,
the
only
thing
I
would
like
the
website
to
have
is
karma
coin
that
arent
nexon
specific
:P
I
was
looking
for
a
general
karma
coin
card
that
would
work
for
digimon
masters
online
which
isnt
a
nexon
game
but
accepts
karma
coin.
I
bought
headers
for
a
2000
Subaru
out
back.
when
I
received
the
part
it
didn't
fit
so
I
requested
a
return
authorization
number.
I
received
an
email
back
that
basically
told
me
they
had
no
idea
what
I
was
talking
about.
Now
I
have
to
pay
to
return
a
part
that
I
already
paid
to
ship.
We
visit
Florida
each
year
and
stay
at
our
own
home
there.
I
originally
found
USRAC
about
five
years
and
they
have,since
then,
been
consistently
the
best
price
I
have
found.
They
always
use
recognised
rental
companies.
I
still
check
various
comparison
sites
in
case
there
is
another
USRAC
out
there
offering
better
terms
but
have
yet
to
find
anyone
to
compete.
I
have
absolute
faith
in
them
and
will
continue
to
use
their
services.
I
love
the
huge
selection...
Easy
access..
And
affordability.
I
ordered
about
two
weeks

Thanks
I
ordered
a

The

Great

I
have
used
Travelocity
a
few
times
and
never
a
problem.
I
found
Newark
Long
Term
Parking
on
the
internet
and
chose
them
based
on
their
rates
and
the
number
of
positive
reviews.
Located
a
little
further
away
from
the
airport
in
an
industrial
area
I
definitely
needed
directions
to
find
them.
It
was
worth
it.
Friendly
and
courteous
staff,
comfortable
vans,
timely
pickups
and
drop-offs,
and
they
had
the
car
ready
to
go
on
returning.
All
at
very
competitive
rates.
I
could
not
believe
the
number
of
choices
and
the
prices.

If
I
find
something
somewhere
else
I
immediately
go
to
supplement
warehouse
to
find
it
at
a
better
price.
Keep
up
the
good
work.

was
exactly
as
described
and
shipping
was
super
fast.
Ordered
some
bits
for
the
first
time
from
Merlin
Cycles
basically
because
they
came
out
cheapest
for
the
items
I
wanted.
This
was
before
the
sneaky
10%
online
discount!
Got
my
new
Shimano

I

I
thought
the

I

at
what
I
got
for
my

As

I

Having
received
a
badminton
racket
from
Tennisnuts
which
had
no
strings
I
was
obviously
disappointed.
I
completed
a
customer
survey
on-line
and
raised
my
issues
and
disappointment
with
the
company.
The
following
day
I
received
a
message
that
the
Sales
Manager
at
Tennisnuts
had
tried
to
contact
me.
Having
spoken
to
the
Manager
the
following
day
I
accept
his
apology
and
gesture
of
goodwill.
I
would
now
consider
buying
again
from
Tennisnuts
and
believe
strongly
that
customer
care
is
very
important
to
them.
I
was
pleased
to
find
the
parts
I
purchased
at
such
a
great
price
but
when
the
parts
arrived
they
were
not
the
correct
parts
for
the
vehicle.

The
website
indicated
that
they
would
fit
but
that
was
not
the
case.

The
same
parts
from
another
manufacturer
seem
to
be
appropriate.
I
am
not
one
to
write
reviews
but
my
experience
has
been
so
incredibly
terrible
with
fedex
that
I
feel
I
should
share
so
that
people
can
avoid
this
terrible
experience
in
the
future.
My
product
first
of
all
they
would
not
deliver
to
a
home
address
so
I
had
to
go
through
my
cousins
business.
That
wasn't
too
big
of
a
deal.
THEN
the
package
delivered
VERY
damaged,
and
the
claims
process
has
been
a
nightmare.
TERRIBLE
CUSTOMER
SERVICE.
TERRIBLE
COMMUNICATION.
I
AM
the
one
doing
all
the
work
when
they
are
the
ones
who
messed
up.
I
had
to
call
them
to
find
all
this
out
because
no
one
was
going
to
call
me
to
let
me
know
they
messed
up
and
now
the
agent
working
on
my
case
is
ALWAYS
off
when
I
try
to
contact
them.
Then
they
messed
up
with
my
claim
and
now
I
have
to
do
EVERYTHING
again
because
THEY
messed
up
again
and
no
one
is
nice
about
it.
I
work
in
customer
service
so
I
know
what
GOOD
customer
service
is
and
this
has
been
the
COMPLETE
opposite.
I
will
do
everything
in
my
power
to
never
use
FEDEX
again,
they
just
plain
SUCK!
My
company,
The
Edit
Room,
LLC,
has
been
shopping
here
for
over

years.
If
I

they
were
solved
quickly.
Not
had
a
bad
experience.
Can't

Really
cumbersome
Both
of
my
dealings
with
Cult
Pens
have
been
direct
and
straightforward.
Really
good,
I
would
recommend
to
anyone
I
ordered
a
couple
of
solar
security
lights
which
looked
adequate
for
my
needs
(they
were
not
too
expensive).
I
ordered
a
soft
guitar
case
at
12.00
on
Friday,
it
was

at
12.00
on

(the
next

working
day).

really
don't
know
what
else
you
could
ask
for.
My
only
food
for
thought
would
be
and
this
may
be
a
stretch
is
do
warehouse
to
warehouse
shipping
so
I
can
have
a
better
shipping
rate
rather
than
from
c&b&f
and
before
you
know
it
30
or
40
in
shipping
charges
even
the
extra
wait
for
package
would
out
weight
the
cost
to
me.
The
property
was
very
clean
and
well
maintained.
I
felt
that
my
belongings
would
be
safe
and
secure
there.
The
Staff
front
office
woman
working
was
very
helpful
and
informative.
I
was
very
satisfied
with
the
way
I
was
treated
and
the
processes
they
have
in
place.
I
have
already
referred
others
to

Our
trip
designed
by
Tess
at
Jacada
Travel
could
not
have
been
better.

She
took
care
of
every
detail
and
we
were
treated
like
royalty.

She
booked
us
into
lodges
that
were
gems
and
they
had
all
the
amenities
that
first
class
travelers
should
have.
Tess
was
a
dream
to
work
with,
listening
to
all
our
concerns
and
wishes.

She
was
easy
to
contact
and
responded
in
a
timely
manner
after
hours.

This
trip
turned
out
to
be
much
more
than
we
imagined
it
would
be.

We
highly
recommend
Jacada
Travel
and
be
sure
to
ask
for
Tessa
Van
der
Walt
for
your
African
trip.

there

You

Had
an

adding

over

instead
decided
to

from

From

you

all
but
the
first

that
I

and
I
trul

it.

Take
care.
Easy
to
navigate
web
site
makes
it
a

to
find
what
you

Very
good
prices
and
very

-
even
to
the
U.S.
I
usually
shy
away
from
pens
that
are
too
inexpensive
because
you
never
know
what
the
quality
will
be
-
especially
when
you
have
several
upper
crust
pens
in
your
collection.
This
is
not
the
case
with
pens
from
Mr.
Pen
as
you
get
amazing
quality
at
a
very
affordable
price.
They
are
not
only
perfectly
weighted
but
the
feel
on
your
fingers
is,
quite
simply,
and
exquisite
experience.
Add
to
this
the
choice
of
numerous
nibs
and
you
have
a
winner
from
every
vantage
point.
Whether
you're
a
casual
user
or
a
seasoned
writer
the
pens
of
Mr.
Pen
will
be
a
treat
you
will
treasure
for
years
to
come.
After
making
reservation
online
and
going
there
and
choose
my
space
I
was
informed
that
I
needed
to
pay
over
my
quoted
price
of
$8-
that
I
needed
to
pay
$16
for
insurance.

I
has
seen
moved
to
another
location
where
I
do
not
need
to
pay
it.
Found
what
I
was
looking
for
at
a
great
price,
tax
free
and
free
delivery!
First
of
all,
it's
a
lot
cheaper
than
other
warranties.
This
was
the
second
warranty
I
purchased
for
an
iPhone.
I
did
not
have
to
use
the
first
one
(yay!)
but
when
my
battery
started
acting
up
recently
(shutting
off
when
there
was
still
20%
battery
left,
stating
I
had
a
certain
battery
percentage
then
plug
it
in
and
it
jumps
10%)
on
my
iPhone
5
(outside
of
the
Apple
warranty)
I
first
contacted
Apple
to
see
what
they
could
do
and
they
said
I
needed
a
new
battery
and
it
would
cost
$79
to
replace
it.
Ouch!
I
thought
I
would
just
suck
it
up
until
I
replaced
the
phone
but
then
I
remembered
I
had
my
SquareTrade
warranty
so
I
opened
a
case
and
in
my
contract

one

replacement,

this

more
geared
toward

you
could
easily
replace

the

spoke
with

who
authorized

Brought
my

to

to
have
the

sent

a
copy
of

and
on
the

day
I
received
an

that
it
was
accepted
and
the
money
was
in
my

I
can't
believe
how

She
was
thrilled
with

and
said
they
were
perfectly
fresh
and
nicely
arranged.

Good

followed
up
with

and
automated

regarding

Well
done,

Extremely

ordered
a
monogrammed
item
Friday
day,
it
was
delivered
by
Sat
morning.
Item
was
as
ordered
and
it
was
the
best
price
on
the
Internet.
Plus
the
free
shipping
and
free

I
ordered
a

They
took
11
days
to
ship
my
order
and
never
communicated
with
me
until
I
called
them
on
the
10th
day.
They
shipped
only
after
I
filed
a
paypal
claim.
If
it
was
back
ordered
they
should
have
just
let
me
know.
I
received
it
about
18
days
after
I
ordered
and
paid
for
it.
Where

I
have
been
going
through

the

of

when
everything
had
to
be
ordered
over
the
phone
or
--
ugh
--
BY
SNAIL

I
have
always
found
their
prices
to
be
competitive,
their
service
to
be
excellent
-
never
hassles
with
returns,
always
extremely
helpful
&
knowledgeable
advice.

Their
turn-around
time
for
processing
and
shipping
is
also
great.

I
highly
recommend
them
to
anybody
in
the
market
for
photo
or
electronics.
If
you
want
to
know
how
they
really
are,
just
ask
someone
that
have
bought
Simcity

to
them.
They
were
selling
bunches
of
keys
of
the
game
on
"pre-order"
months
before
the
release
date,
promising
they
would
get
the
key
2
days
before
the
release.
I
really
can't
think
of
anything
to
fault
them
on.
I
ordered
two
parts
that
were
same
and
was
only
delivered
one
yet
they
claim
they
sent
both.

I
filled
out
the
support
ticket
online
which
is
the
only
way
to
contact
them
because
they
do
not
have
a
customer
service
phone
number.
I
got
an
initial
response
that
did
not
make
sense
I
could
not
tell
if
they
were
asking
me
a
question
or
trying
to
tell
me
the
reason
why
my
second
part
was
delivered.

I
responded
to
the
email
explaining
exactly
the
problem
and
even
telling
them
the
probable
mix
up
on
their
end
as
to
why
my
second
part
was
not
sent
and
never
got
a
response
and
had
to
dispute
the
charge
on
my
credit
card
because
i
paid
for
two
parts
but
only
got
one.

I
always

around

but
almost
always
come
to
B&H
to
make
a
purchase.
With
free
shipping
and
usually
no

it
is
a
no

Really!
I
have
used
them
before
and
will
continue
to
use
them
again.

Others

this

I
really
recommend
the

of
items
that
B&H
offers,
and
their
support
is
second
to
none.
Pricing
can
sometimes
be
higher
than

their
customer

is
worth
almost
any

I
have
ordered
parts
from
4WD
Hardware
before
and
have
always
had
good
results.
I
had
placed
an
order
on
10
May
14
for
an
item
that
needed
to
be
special
ordered
from
Poison
Spyder
and
was
told
it
would
take
2-3
week
before
it
was
shipped.
Well
I
wish
I
could
say
I
got
this
order
like
I
was
suppose
to.
I
waited
until
10
June
before
I
wrote
to
ask
where
my
order
was.
I
got
an
email
back
tell
me
your
order
is
going
to
be
shipping
the
next
day.
So
if
I
hadn't
wrote
and
asked
where
my
order
was
who
knows
how
long
it
would
have
been
before
I
would
have
gotten
my
part.
This
is
just
very
poor
customer
service.
And
then
the
part
wasn't
shipped
2
or
3
day
delivery
so
I
had
to
wait
a
week
before
I
got
the
part.
And
since
I
wrote
and
asked
about
my
missing
part
I
have
received
no
emails
or
other
communication
from
anyone
at
4WD.
To
say
I
am
not
happy
with
the
whole
situation
is
an
understatement.
Great
products
and
great
service.
Shipping
is
always
fast
too!!
Our

team
has
ordered

The

and
the

Equally
important,
the

I

the
after

support
was
excellent
and
issue
pinpointed
to
be
my

Different

was
then
sullpied
to

issue.
I
placed
an
order
for
a
locking
gas
cap
for
my
Taurus.

When
I
tried
to
enter
my
PO
Box
(
I
can't
get
mail
delivered
to
my
home)
the
entry
on
the
order
form
was
refused
with,
"We
don't
deliver
to
PO
Boxes".

So
I
figured
that
the
parcel
would
be
sent
UPS
or
FedEx.

When
I
got
the
e-mail
receipt
back
it
showed
that
the
item
had
been
sent
by
US
Mail.....Go
figure!


I
try
to
find
a
phone
number
for
customer
service
and
there
is
none.

I
e-mail
customer
service
to
tell
them
that
unless
the
Postmaster
goes

to
the
trouble
to
look
up
my
PO
Box
number
by
using
my
name
and
physical
address,
their
package
might
be
returned.

I
got
a
reply
by
e_mail
saying
the
same
thing...my
package
had
been
sent
USPS.

I
then
sent
a
FAX
stating
the
problem.

Never
got
a
reply.

Luckily
my
Post
Master
cross
referenced
my
physical
address
and
placed
the
order
in
my
PO

I
wanted

it

Only
negative
thing
is
I
hate
paying

Auto
Europe
provides
an
easy
method
to
reserve/rent
a
vehicle
for
your
travels
in
Europe.

But
you
must
know
about
returning
your
car
to
a
different
location.

There
are
fees
(not
Auto
Europe's)
which
can
be
quite
high.

I
rented
for
6
days
and
my
cost
for
returning
it
to
a
different
city
was
more
than
the
original
fee
to
Auto
Europe
to
rent
it.

I
knew
there
would
be
a
fee
but
I
had
no
idea
it
would
be
that
much.

Auto
Europe
will
return
rental
fees
if
you
return
early.

Customer
service
is
great,
easy
to
talk
to
and
very
courteous.

I
will
rent
from
them
again.

I
will
,
however
arrange
my

to
start
and
end

the

location.

Great
it

awesome
When

the

was
not

somewhat

If

When
I
placed
my
order
for
a
window
motor
and
track
assembly
for
my
Pontiac
Grand
Prix
GT
2002
model
year,
I
had
a
surprise
when
my
delivery
arrived.

Instead
of
the
drivers
door
unit,
you
sent
me
the
drivers
rear
unit?
Always
a
great
selection,
quick
shipping
and
very
good
parts.
I
purchased
a
Barbour
jacket
from
Country
Attire,
the
selection
and
availability
of
products
was
excellent.
The
jacket
had
a
manufacturing
defect
and
it
was
replaced
quickly
and
free
of
charge,
even
the
postage
was
free.
I
will
definitely
buy
quality
garments
from
them
again.
this
product
was
exactly
what
ordered,
delivered
on
time,
instructions
were
easy
to
follow
to
replace
broken
part
couldn't
be
more
satisfied
I
will
certainly
use
B&H
Photo-Video
again.
Part
delivered
in
a
timely
fashion,
it
was
inexpensive
and
it
is
as
promised.

All
you
can
ask
for.
Now
that
I
have
this
service
set
up
properly,
it
works
well
enough
and
is
finally
cooperating
with
my
Google
Voice
account.
I
had
two
problems
-
spoofing
your
Google
Voice
number
from
your
Phone
Power
account
is
NOT
a
good
idea.
Correcting
this
is
not
something
you
can
do
for
yourself.
I
had
to
make
multiple
calls
to
Phone
Power
to
get
this
set
correctly.
It
should
have
been
handled
correctly
the
first
time.
Phone
Power
service
rep
was
a
bit
snarky.
GV
locks
you
out
of
your
voicemail
if
you
try
to
access
it
from
Phone
Power
with
a
spoofed
GV
phone
number.
Also,
if
you
want
GV
to
handle
your
voicemail,
you
have
to
do
a
somewhat
deeper
dive
into
your
Phone
Power
account
to
customize
the
number
of
rings
so
that
the
call
goes
to
Google
Voice
voicemail,
otherwise
your
calls
will
go
to
Phone
Power
voicemail,
which
is
not
what
I
wanted.
Also,
I
am
not
thrilled
that
the
rate
I
got
for
switching
from
from
free
GV
to
for-pay
Phone
Power
seems
to
be
an
introductory
rate
and
does
not
seem
to
be
renewable.
I
would
have
done
some
more
research
into
alternatives
had
I
known
this
was
the
case
before
committing
myself
to
Phone
Power.
It
seems
that
people
whose
GV
was
working
as
mine
was
through
an
Obi
100
could
have
kept
free
GV
call
termination
for
some
time
after
the
threatened
cut-off
date
-
I
can't
do
without
a
phone

line.
I
bought
the
Powersaver
24/7
Immersion
Controller,
it
was
easy
to
fit,
easy
to
program
and
easy
to
use.
The
30
mins,
1
hour
and
2
hour
boost
function
is
what
sold
it
for
me
as
I'm
using
it
to
control
the
heating
element
in
a
dual
fuel
towel
radiator
I
bought
shower
seal
S1
for
8mm
glass
and
it
was
perfect,
I
just
had
to
cut
4mm
of
the
flexible
wiper
for
my
application.
I
ordered
a
Smeg
cooker
hood
for
delivery
on
a
Tuesday
but
on
the
Monday
I
received
an
e-mail
from
customer
services
to
say
that
the
one
I'd
ordered
was
currently
out
of
stock
but
could
be
delivered
on
Thursday
but
I
could
let
them
know
if
I
would
like
a
more
expensive
Bosch
one
for
the
same
price,
which
would
still
be
delivered
on
Tuesday.
I
didn't
have
time
to
reply
straight
away
but
would
do
so
when
I
got
home
in
the
evening,
however
during
the
afternoon
I
missed
a
call
from
them
and
they
left
an
answer
phone
message.
As
soon
as
I
got
home
they
called
again
and
offered
me
the
alternative
but
I
decided
to
stick
with
the
Smeg
I'd
ordered
and
wait
until
Thursday.
They
even
took
the
trouble
to
enquire
why
I
preferred
to
have
the
Smeg
over
the
alternative
(the
Smeg
is
thinner
to
give
me
more
head
room).
The
hood
was
delivered
promptly
on
the
Thursday
after
having
been
given
a
1
hour
delivery
window
by
text
earlier
that
morning.
My
transaction
was
extremely
smooth
and
efficient.
Living
in
the
US,
I
received
this
delivery
faster
than
things
I
would
expect
domestically.
Well
done
and
a
fantastic
product.

I
was
about
to
buy
this
from
amazon,
but
noticed
that
it
would
cost
quite
a
bit
to
ship
it
so
I
searched
around.
I
found
the

&
thought
it
looked
very
straightforward
&
was

I

it

within
a

two,

very

I

I
reserved

In

I

and

Hoi,
I
booked

we
missed

Great
products,
kept
well
informed
throughout
the
ordering/delivery
process.
Everything
turned
up
on

I
will
be
using
the
site
again.
Good
website,
simple
to
use
and
I
found
the
product
I
wanted
with
ease.
Found
the
customer
reviews
and
recommendations
really
useful
too.
Not
the
cheapest
price
found
online
but
with
the
Ocado
voucher
offer
it
became
the
most
cost
effective
option.
Placed
my
order
with
ease,
options
on
delivery

were
plenty
and
very
prompt.

heard
about

from
a
friend,
went
on

to
find
the

for
my

a

sight
cheaper
than

i
enterered

was

I
therefore

I
was
in
the
USA
and
my
return
flight
to
Heathrow
was
changed
a
week
before
coming
back
to
a
new
date
and
flight
number.
I
emailed
customer
services
to
advise
of
this
and
asked
for
a
confirmation
of
the
new
pick
up
time.
I
did
receive
an
automated
acknowledgment
email
saying
they
would
respond
in
24hours;

however,
3
days
later,
this
did
not
happen
so
I
had
to
follow
this
up
with
a
telephone
call
from
abroad
and
ask
to
speak
to
a
supervisor
before
the
changes
were
made
which
given
the
time
difference
and
10
minute
roaming
charges
were
disappointing.
They
also
said
they
weren't
aware
of
the
new
arrival
dates
which
means
no
one
bothered
reading
the
emails.

Like
most
pet
owners
we
would
spend
on
our
dog
whatever
it
cost
for
treatment
and
never
question
a
vet
bill.

Only
by
chance
I
had
their
latest
invoice
on
my
desk
when
I
researched
his
condition.
When
I
found
I
could
save
around
60%
on
his
medication
I
was
suspicious.
But
when
the
medication
arrived
it
was
from
the
same
batch
with
the
same
date
as
the
first
lot
I
had
purchased
from
my
vet.

I
have
now
made
my
second
purchase
and
it
arrived
by
post
within
48
hours.
Don’t
get
me
wrong,
I
have
nothing
against
the
vet
making
a
profit
but
their
mark
up
was
a
little
OTT.
Thank
you

it

have
been
customer
friendly
for

to

That
would

that
I
like,
more
than

The
things
that
I
like
most
is
you
don't

you
are
informed
at

via

that

then
processed,
then

(there
are
numerous
options

which
I
rarely

Then
it

in

you
do
have

is
very
rare,
they
are

We
were
attracted
to

several
faucets,

and

systems
several
years
ago
and
were
plaqued
with

particularly
the

valves.

We
had
much
difficulty
contacting
customer
service,
who
ultimately
did
not
seem
to
know
how
to

We
even
had
to
entirely

a
newly

system
because
we
could
not

it.

we

(it
was

Rather
than

this,
we
simply
called
our

at
CarsDirect.com
and
he
set
the

straight
and

I
had
a
problem
they
resolved
it
quickly
and
to
my
satisfaction.
I
have
used
the
Global
Parking
website
on
two
occasions
and
it
such
a
quick
and
easy
process
to
go
through
that
I
feel
totally
comfortable
using
it.

I
can't
say
the
same
about
other
websites
that
I
have
used.

When
I
had
deal's
to
contact
a
representative
by
phone,
the
person
I
talked
to
was
not
only
professional
but
was
courteous
and
helpful.

I
plan
to
make
all
my
future
long
term
parking
arrangements
with
Global
Parking.
I
was
able
to
find
the
part
I
needed,
when
I
couldn't
find
it
anywhere
else.
It
shipped
and
arrived
quickly.
The
only
draw
back
was
that
the
shipping
cost
was
pretty
steep.
I
ordered
a
6
gallon
water
heater
that
was
priced
for
less
than
several
other
websites.
Not
only
was
it

it
was
delivered
the
morning
after
it
was
ordered.

and
the

time
is
awesome.
Been
using
Shopto
for
a
long
time
and
I
haven't
been
disappointed
once!
Ordered
4
tyres
online,
no
problems
reported.
I
ordered
the
part
and
received
an
e-mail
confirmation
my
order
was
pending
payment
approval.
The
next
day,
I
received
another
e-mail
confirmation
my
payment
was
approved
and
my
order
was
pending.
Four
days
later
I
received
another
e-mail
confirmation
my
order
was
being
refunded
without
any
other
notice
concerning
the
part.
Was
it
backordered,
unavailable,
damaged
in
shipment?...

I'm
assuming
I
need
to
order
the
part
from
another
source
but
an
e-mail
explanation
would
be
nice
since
that
seems
to
be
the
communication
method
of
choice.
Extra
Super
Fast
service
shocked
me
completely.
Your
"better
than
I
could
have
imagined"
service
left
me
with
a
huge
smile.
I
had
the
car
apart
and
repaired
it
(myself)
before
the
next
parts
even
arrived.

I
don't
know
if
the
second
order
of
parts
will
fit
because
I
haven't
gotten
back
to
the
project
since
the
first
parts
arrived
so
fast.
But,
I
do
have
renewed
faith
that
they
sent
me
the
right
parts...
since
they
obviously
resolved
my
first
challenge
with
such
ease.
The
item
was
ordered
on
second
of
June
as
a
birthday
gift
for
my
son,
delivery
was
programmed
as
standard,
that
is,
within
3
days.
On
the
3rd
of
June
I
received
a
"garbled"
automated
telephone
call
stating
that
delivery
was
to
take
place
within
24
hours.
By
Friday,
the
6th
of
June,
no
delivery
had
been
made.
My
son
worked
from
home
on
a
couple
of
days
expecting
the
delivery.
On
Friday
6th
of
June
I
telephoned
Homebase
"on
line
query
departrment"
to
be
told
that
the
item
had
been
delivered
on
4th
of
June
and
left
in
a
"secure
place"
on
the
front
of
the
house.
This
had
not
taken
place
and
there
is
NO
SECURE
PLACE
AT
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
HOUSE
AS
IT
IS
COMPLETELY
OPEN
TO
THE
ROAD!!!!
Additionally,
NO
UNSUCCESSFUL
delivery
notification
card
had
been
left
at
the
house
,
THE
ITEM
COULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
LEFT
AT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
HOUSE
AS
A
LOCKED
GATE
SECURES
ACCESS
TO
THE
BACK
OF
THE

The
lady
handling
my
query
eventually
arranged
for
an
item
to
be
available
for
COLLECTION
at
the
Southampton
shop
on
Saturday
7th
June.
I
requested
refund
of
the
delivery
fee
which
was
received
in
my
Bank
account
on
Monday
9th

I
recommend
you
try
purchasing
your
your

canon

inks
from
Printer
Basics.
They
are
safely
packaged
and
quickly
delivered.
They
give
very
satisfactory
well

photos,
as
good
as
original
canon
inks,
at
a
very
good
price
both
in
set
form
for
a
particular
printer
or
as
individual
items.
They
have
similar
arrangements
for
other
manufacturers
printers
(if
yours
isn't
a
canon
printer)

I
love
that
Town
Fair

will
plug/repair
my
tire
when
I
have
a

in
it,
but
why
does
it
take
them
2-3
hours
to
do
it?!?!
My
car
is
only
in
the
bay
for
15
mins
tops?
Why
am
I
waiting
another
2-2.5
hrs
to
get
in
there?
Can't
I
make
an
appointment
so
I
don't
have
to
spend
an
evening
roaming
around
the
nearby
locations
waiting
to
get
into
the

Just
a
suggestion.
Otherwise,
the

is
good
and
so
is
the

without
any
problems.
I
love
the
choice
and
the
value
of
the
product,
but
having
the
VAT
added
at
the
till,
and
then
even
to
the
postage
is
a
continual
frustration.
Especially
as
when
I
apply
a
discount
it
only
takes
it
off
the
base
price
of
the
goods.
It's
only
a
minor
niggle
though,
as
the
selection
and
speed
of
delivery
more
than
make
up
for
this!

I
have

the

Without

I
will
continue

Wow,
what
a
great
experience
renting
a
car
in
England.
We
were
able
to
finalize
everything
from
the
US
and
when
we
went
to
pick
up
the
Ford
Focus,
at
the
National
agency
in
Slough,

they
had
upgraded
us
to
a
Mercedes
wagon.
I
know
this
doesn't
always
happen,
but
it
was
a
nice
surprise.
Didn't
have
one
complaint
about
the
car
and
upon
our
return
to
drop
off
the
car
at
the
airport,
we
were
met
promptly
and
spent
a
total
of
maybe
10
minutes
in
the
agency
office
before
catching
their
free
shuttle
to
the
airport
terminal.
Sure
glad
I
had
the
CDW
coverage
from
my
credit

company.
Walked
away
satisfied
and
even
got
a
small
refund
because
we
returned

a
few
hours
early.
I
can
only
hope
all
who
use
Rentalcars.com,
will
have
the
same
positive
experience
that
we
had.
I
would
definately
use
the
service
again.
The
screen
was
shipped
fast.
Wish
it
had
specific
model
instructions,
but
it's
not
too
hard
to
figure
out.
Overall,
you
really
can't
beat
it!
I
would
never
,ever
shop
at
this
place
again.
The
customer
service
people
are
arrogant
and
rude.
All
they
want
is
the
money.
Beware
of
this
retailer!!
i
bought
a
laptop
here
and
questioned
the
sale
price
later,and
they
told
me...too
bad,
you
already
bought
it
at
the
high
price,so
why
would
we
give
you
the
sale
price.
I
would
sooner
go
to
another
store.
Never
Again!!!!
My
first
transaction
here.
I
will
come

This

my
2nd.

the
pool
closing
kit
from
Doheny's
and
by
the

I
have
only

This
kit
works
well,
very
easy

No

The

what
I
wanted
with
great

I
received
my

very
quickly
and

Very

Very

I'd

I've
carried
a
pocket
knife
since
I
was
in
the
Cubs,
my
last
being
a
little
Opinel.

I
was
uneasy
about
that
-
while
it
was
everything
I
needed,
I
knew
in
the
back
of
my
mind
it
wasn't
legal
to
carry
it.

At
my
age
you
wouldn't
think
that
should
be
a
worry,
but
these
days
you
actually
can
get
stopped
and
searched
(at
a
passport
office
for
example).

This
knife
seems
fine
-
non-locking,
self
sharpening
(we'll
see
how
that
turns
out),
and

it
appears
to
be
well
able
to
carry
out
a
pocket
knife's
essential
function
-
to
cut
things.

So
far,
so
good.
Doctor's
RX
on
file
but
they
would
not
ship
order
because
I
didn't
sign
up
for
automatic
shipments.

this
means
a
new
Rx
for
every
time
you
order.

Will
never
order
from
them
again.

Amazing
how
they
automatically
came
up
with
my
name,
address
and
credit
card
-
but
no
record
of
a
previous
prescription.
This
is
very
very
close
to
the
original
aftershave
i
used
to
use
back
when
they
still
sold
them
now
they
have
the
classic
one
which
i
do
not
like
at
all
overall
everything
was
great
and
will
buy
again
!
STG
is
my
first
choice
for
online
shopping.

Why?
Ordered
my
items
on
Saturday
night
to
be
delivered
today
before
12
o
clock,
got
a
few
emails
to
update
me
on
my
order
which
was
great
to
have
and
was
also
tracked
right
up
until
delivery,
Which
came
at
10
o
clock
this
morning,
the
item
itself
was
in
great
condition
and
plays
very
nice
will
definitely
use
again
and
recommend
to
others
go
for
smoke
have
a
great

range
of
products
and
there
customer
service
is
second
to
non.

Did
i
mention
free
postage,
free
eliquid
and
one
of
the
most
competivelty
priced
products
on
the
market
its
a
no
brainer
:)
I
asked
a
couple
questions
they
responded
with
the
right
answers
and
the
parts
were
exactly
right.
I'm
not
much
of
a
computer
person
but
it
was
as
painless
as
it
could
have
been.
I'd
and
will
use
these
guys
every
time.
Used
this
site
for
some
time
now.
Never
had
any
problems
and
the
delivery
time
has
always
been
top
class.
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
packing
of
my
plants
when
they
arrived.
We
love
our
comfy
sack!
It
is
the
first
seat
taken.
We
have
owned
our
sack
forever
and
just
recently
purchased
some
additional
foam.
The
trasaction
was
quick
and
easy
and
the
delivery
was
fast.
Best

of

I
found
B&H
using
a
google
search
on
a
product
I
wanted.

Shipping
was
free
and
fast
-

I
will
come
and
shop
here
again
delivery
is
very
slow
2
weeks
to
get
some

.
Worked
with
my
needs,
price
and
all.
Ron
and
his
wife
helped
us
get
moved
in
without
hassle.
I
ordered
a
Hope
freehub
body
which
was
already
competitively
priced
and
then
received
a
further
10%
off
at
the
checkout.
Delivery
was
free.
The
item
was
despatched
the
next
morning
and
arrived
the
day
after
that.
Well
definitely
use
Merlin
again.
Ordered
several
transformers
on
Sunday
night
and
received
them
a
couple
of
days
later.
Goods
were
well
packaged
and
as
described,
delivery
was
free
as
the
order
came
in
over
50
quid.
Will
definitely
use
these
people
again.
I
thought
the
website
was
excellent
very
simple
to
follow
and
had
good
details
of
the
parts
I
was
after.Tne
part
ordered
arrived
sooner
than
I
thought
which
was
great.I
would
recommend
this
website.-
I
am
presently
waiting
to
see
how
they
will
respond
to
a
mistake
of
a
wrong
part.

I
have
had
difficulty
trying
to
get
an
answer
so
I
will
not
give
any
positive
comments
yet.

If
they
rectify
the
situation
by
allowing
me
to
return
a
wrong
part
and
a
return
of
funds,
I
will
gladly
add
my
praise.

thanks
Love
everything
you
guys
and
gals
do!
They
give
a
good
account
of
the
goods
you're
looking
at,
most
have
photo's
to
back
up
descriptions
so
you're
pretty
sure
of
what
you're
buying,
almost
as
good
as
being
in
the
shop.
I
loved
the
transaction,
it
was
fast
and
the
parts
are
what
they
descibe.
I
will
would

shot
you
won't
be
disappointed.
great
job
guys!!!!!!
i
don't
buy
my
supplements
anywhere
else
With
undercutting
competitors
prices
it's
impossible
to
get
it
cheaper,
and
it
ships
extremely
quick....What
else
do
you
want
from
a
supplement
company?
We
are
very
pleased
with
the
help
with
our
reservation.

The
agent
was
very
courteous
and
helpful.
Great
to
find
luxurious
items
at
great
prices
that
create
a
great
experience
in
shaving.
After
50
years
of
shaving
I
now
appreciate
using
great
equipment
that
I
never
knew
existed
for
such
a
required
regimen.
I
have
ordered
some
pretty
expensive
items
at
a
really
reasonable
cost.
The
experience
has
always
been
great!
We
have
found
J
to
be
very
hard
working
and
has
come
up
with
numerous
solutions
to
help
develop
and
expand
our
online
business.
He
has
also
been
very
creative
and
always
available.
Best
thing
to
happen
to
us
on
our
e
commerce
site.
With
gas
prices
these
days,
it
would
cost
2
gallons
of
gas
to
go
to
and
return
from
the
closest
store
where
our
brand
of
dog
food
might
be
found.
I
say
might
be
found
because
it
is
often
not
available.
PetFlow
has
a
much
better
selection
and
so
far
has
our
brand
in
stock.
Being
retired,
the
savings
is
appreciated.
You
need
to
improve
your
customer
service.

I
attempted
to
contact
your
company
because
I
had
a
damaged
part.

All
I
received
was
an
automated
phone
recording
and
put
on
hold.

No
one
ever
answered
the
phone.
I
don't
think
I
will
ever
purchase
from
your
company
again.
Easy,
fast
and
delivered
to
me
overseas
in
two
days
as
promised!

Constant
communication
from
them.
Great
experience!
Found
the
part
I
needed
on
line.
It
was
quick
and
easy
to
order.
A
few
days
later
the
part
showed
up
at
my
doorstep.
Correct
part

I
installed
it
right
away
and
have
had
no
issues.
I
would
recommend
PartsGeek
to
anyone.
Excellent
service
I
will
recommend
and
also
use
it
again

exactly
what
I
needed
I
was
a
little
hesitant
of
them
a
couple
years
ago,
tried
them
out
and
have
continued
to
go
back
ever
since.
Great
tasting,
awesome
ingredients,
but
super
overpriced:
only
ten
servings
per
420g
container.

I
can
buy
high
quality,
organic

much
cheaper.
Much
love
to

I
won't
be
ordering
any
more

Just
found
this
site
looking
for
the
best
deal
on
some
MHP
IsoFast
50.

They
didn't
have
the
best
price...until
I
plugged
in
the
competitor's
price
and
then
they
BEAT
the
best
price
I
could
find.

True
they
don't
offer
free
shipping...but
they're
pretty
honest
about
the
deal
since
the
sites
I
compared
that
offered
free
shipping
truly
were
more
expensive
in
the
long
run.
Great
customer
service!
STG
has

most
honest
and
detailed

on
the
net,
period.
You
can
get
a
detailed
overview
of
a
product
from
anyone
who
sells
anything,
but
only
STG
will
tell
you
both
the
good
and
the
bad,
give
an
honest
opinion,
and
tell
you
exactly
what
is
and
isn't
going
to
keep
you
safe
for
however
you
plan
to
ride.

You
can
check

with
search
engines
and
haggle
out
the
best
deal
if
you
think
you
can
beat
them,
but
call
them
up
and
you
will
get
the
best

on
the
safest

with
the

I
couldn't
be
happier
with
every
single
item
I've
bought
and
conversation
I've
had
with
these
guys.

They're
the
best,
and
they've
earned
my
business
for
life.
That''s
just
the
way
it
is.
I
primarily
bought
it
because
it
was
the
best
product
I
could
find
to
attach
my
iPad3
to
the
car
headrest
(to
keep
my
2
year
old
entertained
on
long
trips)
but
now
I
use
the
carry
case
more
than
I
do
my
official
iPad
cover
-
which
isn't
as
sturdy
when
I
stand
the
iPad
up.
So
that's
a
win/win
as
far
as
I'm
concerned.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
used
this
dealer
-
the
service
was
prompt
and
efficient.
The
web
site
was
easy
to
navigate.

I
quickly
found
everything
I
was
looking
for.

Prices
were
somewhat
better
than
other
on-line
sources,
and,
of
course,
considerably
lower
than
the
brick-and-mortar
stores.

My
order
was
shipped
promptly
and
arrived
in
a
few
days.

Everything
was
in
perfect
condition
and
exactly
as
advertised.

and
got

to

very
quickly
Quick

B&H
has
always
been
very
"user
friendly"
to
deal
with.

Their
technical
help
has
been
a
big
plus.
Easy,
no
problems
and
they
kept
us
informed
with
the
ability
to
track
the
order.
Great
company
match
competitor
prices
I
think
I
got
a
good
product
for
the
money
spent,
but
I
was
told
I
would
be
in
and
out
in
45-60
mins
(and
I
had
an
appointment!)
but
I
was
there
for
two
hours,
with
no
update
while
waiting,
no
apology
or
financial
concession.

After
you
spend
$775
you
should
not
drive
off
the
premises
frustrated
or
disappointed.

At
that
moment,
I
left
spending
what
I
considered
significant
money
and
I
was
not
pleased
with
my
experience.
My
glasses
are
great,
I
got
the
best
price
on
Ray-Bans
out
of
everywhere
I
looked
and
they
always
responded
right
away
to
my
questions
via
email.
Swift
servcie
at
a
good
price.

Tyres
working
well
(although
they
have
only
been
on
the
car
for
a
few
days).
I
order
my
part
,and
I
got
it
next
day.
The
part
is
good,
and
the
price
is
good
too.
Bought
the
inner
fender
well
and
front
guard
for
inside
the
wheel
well
on
my
2003
Lesabre.
The
inner
fenderwell
was
paper
thin
compared
to
the
original,
the
front
guard
was
much
better
in
quality
and
thickness.
Didn't
use
the
inner
fenderwell
because
of
the
quality.
After
we
submitted
our
inquiry,
we
heard
back
quickly
from
David
Chen,
one
of
the
account
managers
at
Flashbay.
And
once
we
confirmed
on
the
logo,
we

Hey,
the
parts
for
my
'95
Nissan
pickup
are
easy
to
locate
on
the
web
site,
even
for
a
man
with
little
mechanical
aptitude
interest
or
ability.
I
got
what
I
needed
promptly
and
inexpensively.
I
did
not
know
about
this
company
but
when
I
bought
my
first
floodlights
with
them,
my
experience
was
awesome.
Price,
delivery
and
product
are
excellent.
I
am
writing
before
I
even
get
there
to
say.
Received
the
part
i
wanted
in
a
timely
manner.

i
was
very
pleased
and
would
use
the
service
again.
Bought
a
North
Face
Gilet
for
myself
and
a
jacket
for
my
Girlfriend
a
week
later,
both
arrived
within
2
days
with
free
delivery.
Substantial
saving
over
rrp
prices,
£40
and
£70
saving,
cheapest
I
could
find
online.
I
would
definitely
recommend
The
Outdoor
Shop
and
I
will
buy
again.
What
more
can
you
want
except
a
huge
range
and
they
have
that
covered
as
well
This
is
a
great
site
easy
to
use
an
great
layout
plus
there
are
pleny
of
different
brands
to
choose
from!
We
decided
we
wanted
NOT
to
have
a
TV
visible
in
our
living
room.
The
TV
lift
cabinet
was
a
great
option.
Our
Bose
TV
presented
a
bit
of
a
problem,
but
it
was
resolved
creatively
and
without
much
of
an
issue.
We
have
had
a
problem
with
swelling
of
the
top
that
would
not
close
completely.
Several
visit
from
a
local
wood
"doctor"
solved
the
problem.
We
are
delighted
with
out
choice.
The
company
has
worked
with
us
easily
on
the
small
glitches.
When
I
took
my
concerns
to
the
manager,
about
the
insulation
falling
from
the
ceiling
on
my
expensive
and
collectible
car
(1
of
22
and
in
mint
condition)
she
said:
“it’s
only
paper
insulation
and
it
wipes
right
off”.
To
which
I
quickly
replied
and
before
she
placed
her
hand
on
the
surface:
"don’t
do
that”
which
she
promptly
did.
The
she
said:
“
look
it
wipes
right
off”.
I
immediately
asked
her
to
leave
before
I
told
her
what
an
idiot
that
she
is.
I
had
to
clean,
buff
and
polish
the
hood
several
times
to
get
the
marks
out.
It’s
not
surprising
that
she
drives
a
Geo
(nothing
against
Geo’s
but
it’s
not
my
idea
of
a
sensible
or
desirable
car).
When
I
moved
out
of
the
unit
she
asked
me:
”
if
I
had
cleaned
the
unit
out
prior
to
leaving”
to
which
I
replied:
“I
have
removed
my
belonging
but
left
all
of
the
debris
from
the
ceiling
behind”
and
promptly
left
without
saying
another
word.
I
would
recommend
supplement
wearhouse
to
anyone
trying
to
buy
supplements
because
they
have
the
cheapest
prices
out
there.
They
may
have
high
shipping
prices
but
it
is
worth
it
with
how
good
of
deals
you
receive.
Not
to
mention
them
matching
competitors
prices
and
even
going
5%
lower.
We
got
exactly
what
they
promised
us
,
good
service
without
any
problems.
I
got
one
of
there
power
steering
hose
for
my
Nissan
Murano
it
is
installed
and
hopefully
it
will
last
7
years
like
the
oringinal.

Hey
friend,
when
your
auto
part
fails,
check
out
this
site
to
see
if
you
can
order
it
and
replace
it
yourself,
rather
than
pay
a
mechanic
or
shop
to
do
it.


Too
easy.
No
matter
whether
you
are
a
professional
or
an
amateur.
You
will

This
is
my
#1
site,
for
buying
all
my

I
ordered
one

It
came
on
time
and
intact
as
promised.
Thank
you.
I
WOULD

THIS

I

I
ordered

for
for
our
new
Lab
puppy.
It
was
an
easy
process,
and
the
live
chat
folks
who
answered
several
questions,
a
couple
of
different
times,
were
like
other
dog
owners
providing
advice
and
not
sales
people.
The
web
site
was
easy
to
navigate
and
understand.

I
felt
confident
that
I
was
getting
the
correct
part.

The
price
was
half
as
much
as
other
suppliers.

I
will
be
using
parts
geek
from
now
on.
I
ordered
part
I
needed,
it
was
in
stock
,
it
was
way
cheaper
than
any
auto
part
store.
I
received

the
part
in
2
days
1/3rd
the
price,,
and
that
included
SH.
I
saved
$30.00.
I
will
definitely

order
from
them
again
if
and
when
I
need
the
part.
The
ordering
process
was
easy
and
your
pricing
was
the
best
I
found
on
the
internet.

The
confirmation
emails
on
the
order
were
a
little
confusing
as
they
put
some
doubt
as
to
the
availability
of
the
products
I
ordered
and
seemed
to
contradict
the
information
about
product
availability
that
was
given
when
I
placed
the
order.

However
the
parts
were
shipped
and
delivered
as
ordered,
came
in
a
very
timely
way,
and
were
exactly
what
I
ordered
and
needed.
I
myself
was
recommended
by
a
friend
to
check
out
Dolphin
Fitness
because
of
their
unbeatable
prices.
I
had
just
brought
some
supplements
that
I
thought
were
going
for
a
great
price
but
had
to
immediately
take
them
back
as
Dolphin
Fitness
beat
them
by
a
long
shot.

The

I

PartsGeek
is

their

However,
their
Customer
Service
is
too
computerized

customers
properly.

It

turnoff

Fortunately,
the
impersonal

of
PartsGeek's
Customer
Service
stimulated
me
to
find
a
much

more

company
that
is
already

my

to

there

As
always
wiggle
has
provided
a
great
service
to
me.

Sometimes
there
are
cheaper
websites,
but
when
it
comes
to
delivery/returns/customer
service
there
are
few
competitors
out
there
who
compete.

And
it
is
always
nice
to
get
some

the

Purchased
some
new
winter
training

and
various
other
parts,
searched
around
the

and
these
were
the

Ordered

around

and
the

they
arrived

The

I
ordered
a

which
was
showing
as
expected
delivery
5-10
days.
I
emailed
sales
to
confirm
this
delivery
date,
to
which
I
received
a
very
prompt
response
informing
me
that
the
item
was
due
in
stock
within
the
next
week.
This
was
great
because
I've
had
previous
experiences
with
other
online
suppliers
where
they
advertise
the
item
as
being
available,
only
to
find
out
that
this
is
not
the
case
after
purchasing
it.
I
only
wish
I'd
have
written
down
the
names
of
the
people
that
helped
us.

From
the
lady
at
the
counter,
to
the
guys
working
the
send
out
office
at
the
lot,
everyone
was
extremely
helpful
and
friendly.

We
found
the
car
we
picked
was
just
right
for
our
touring.

It
was
an
Open

wagon
that
worked
out
great.

I
will
definitely
used

I
will
do
business
with
them
again.
I
use
printerinks
for
all
my
domestic
needs
but
feel
the
loyalty
to
me
could
be
better.
Little
incentive
to
re-order
in
future
Placed
order,
but
the
wrong
item
was
sent
,
I
emailed
explaining
my
problem
,
I
had
immediate
response
and
apologies
sent
item
back
Freepost
and
was
sent
replacement
without
a
single
problem
!
Excellent
service
thank
you
guys
....
I
would
use
or
recommend
without
hesitation
A*
Competitive
pricing,
free
delivery
(even
on
a
Sunday)
and
superb
communications
-
what
more
could
anyone
ask
for?
Found
the
part
$60
cheaper
on
partsgeek
,
exact
same
brand
that
autozone
had
but
alot
cheaper.
Cant
complain
I
found
lower
prices
elsewhere,
but
by
the
time
shipping
and
handling
charges
were
added,
their
prices
were
considerably
higher
than
PartsGeek.
I
have
used
3000rpm
a
number
of
times
now
and
have
received
an
excellent
professional
service
every
time.
Their
prices
are
very
good
and
are
hard
to
beat.
I
WOULD
RECOMMEND
THIS
COMPANY.
The
SpareFoot
representative
was
friendly
and
very
helpful,
answered
my
questions
and
suggested
additional
searches.
Would
use
again
Came
across
All
Beauty
some
18/24
months
ago
and
is
now
my
destination
of
choice
for
perfumes,after
shave
and
skin
products.
I've
used
Rentalcars
in
the
UK
and
they
have
been
magical
and
last
year
in
Malaga
again,
they
were
excellent.
I
was
looking
to
replace
a
Shower
Pump
and
struggled
with
the
manufacturers
website.
The
parts
I
received
were
not
the
ones
I
ordered.
I
ordered
two
tie
rods,
and
not
only
was
I
sent
two
different
sizes
(both
incorrect)
they
were
also
missing
the
seals.

When
attempting
to
return
the
incorrect
parts,
I
have
not
been
able
to
get
anyone
from
Partsgeek
on
the
phone.

I
follow
the
steps
outlined
on
their
website
for
returns,
and
generate
a
"return
ticket"
and
after
doing
that
three
times,
I
still
have
only
received
emails
saying
"Thank
you
for
return.
Someone
will
be
contacting
you
within
48
hrs."
Yet
no
one
has
contacted
me.

It
was
bad
enough
that
I
received
the
wrong
parts,
but
its
even
worse
buying
from
a
company
that
doesn't
stand
behind
what
they
sell.
Given
the
limitations
of
buying
online,
i.e
i
don't
get
to
see
the
flowers
in
the
flesh,
this
service
was
very
well
executed.
I
was
informed
at
every
step
by
text
and
email
when
the
flowers,
vase
and
card
would
be
delivered,
and
even
when
they
had
reached
their
destination.
I
used
the
standard
service.
But
if
i'd
wanted
the
flowers
delivered
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
would
have
had
to
upgrade.
Excellent
service
and
fine
selection
of
bouquets.
The
product
i
purchased
was
as
expected,
reasonable
quality
at
a
very
very
reasonable
price.
Delivery
estimated
next
day,
it
arrived
next
day
and
the
instructions
i
left
on
the
delivery
companies
email
were
followed
to

the
letter.
Thats
not
to
mention
that
the
delivery
guys
had
the
food
sense
to
email
me
and
inform
me
of

the
estimated
delivery
day.
Ordered
a
few
times
of
musclefood.com
now,
every
time
all
the
food
came
on
time,
and
even
when
the
couriers
were
being
a
pain
to
deal
with,
and
delivered
my
food
too
late
(not
the
fault
of
musclefood.com),
everything
was
kept
nice
and
chilled.
Easy
to
use,
just
sign
up
and
pay
the
amount
you
want
get
then
pick
the
game
that
you
need
points
for
and
your
done
basically.
Very
easy
and
safe
and
you
don't
need
to
buy
any
annoying
game
cards
in
stores
and
look
like
a
tool.
Just
try
it
once
I
came
in
at
the
last
minute
on
my
spare.
Pressure
was
low
and
had
a
blow
out
a
few
days
earlier.
I
needed
a
new
tire
but
ended
up
getting
two.
10
minutes
later
they
were
done.
Great
customer
service
and
no
complaining
for
the
last
minute
business.
Great
job
guys!
I
bought
a
ox
censor
,
and
it
came
without
the
factory
plugin,
it
cam
with
a
phony
splice
kit
for
the
wires.
I
was
not
informed
of
this
in
the
order.
i
am
very
disappointed
with
parts
geek,
I
had
heard
they
are
a
good
company
to
do
business
with.
Great
results
after
some
reservations
about
whether
I
was
doing
the
right
thing.
Good
service
Bought
3
trophies
with
engraving
from
the
website
which
was
easy
to
navigate
and
slick
from
purchase
to
payment.
Delivered
very
quickly,
quality
of
the
product
is
brilliant,
what
more
could
you
want!
Very
impressed
would
recommend
to
anyone!
Probability
won't
buy
from
again
Great
service
this
time,
I
ordered
250
16x

they
sent
250

8x

discs
,
a
couple

emails
later
I
got
them
sorted.
Great
Job
thanks
guy's.
I
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
return
this
item,
just
didn't
work
my
vehicle
still
reflects
the
same
problem,
although
I
changed
the
part
and
used
a
technician
to
do
it,
please
contact
regarding
the
returning
process.
Ordered
a
bargin
wheel
set
for
my
MTB
and
some
Avid
brakes
on
a
Sunday
and
they
arrived
on
the
Tuesday.
Above
expectations
on
service
and
delivery
arrived
on
time
specified.
Ordered
&
received
products
next
day
could
not
ask
for
better
response
The
curtains
were
of
excellent
quality
and
value.
Good
choice,
competitive
prices,
fast
delivery
I
never
usually
write
reviews,
but
I
feel
that
I
have
to
for
this
website.

I
was
scared
of
purchasing
Skyrim:
Legendary
Edition
from
somewhere
other
than
Steam,
especially
for
so
cheap!

I
even
bought
it
after
11PM
(at
a
strange
time),
but
I
received
my
CD
key
via
email
after
5
minutes.

10/10,
would
buy
from
again.
Terrible
customer
service.
This
is
like
dealing
with
eBay,
not
a
proper
online
company.
A
good
product
for
the
price.
and
quick
delivery.
Ordered
a
playset
for
my
two
boys.
Shedsforless
had
the
best
price
hands
down.
Shipping
was
excellent.
They
are
really
dedicated
people
since
they
done
the
job
on
Sunday
and
less
that
12
hours
.
Very
professional
translation
without
a
doubt
.
Excellent
prices,
jet
fast
shipping,
slick
website:
I'll
definitely
use
Inkfarm
again!
very
fast
shipping
and
excellent
prices
on
OEM
items

I
have
needed.

I
look
forward
to
shopping
here
when
I
need
parts!
I
received
my
part
in
a
box
with
loose
tape
falling
off
and
barely
closed.

Worst
packing
I
have
ever
seen!
Have
not
built
it
yet
(
only
arrived
today
!
)
but
quality
of
timber
&
fittings
look
good,
Knots
all
stopped
up,
great
value
!
Pure
was
easy
to
order
and
the
products
work.

You
should
try
it
and
see
for
yourself.
What
can
I
say!
its
a
magnet-
however
a
very
strong
magnet
for
such
a
compact
unit,
feel
confident
it
will
perform
well
-
impressed
enough
to
order
2
more
.
Great
customer
service.
And
super
fast
delivery.
A
very
efficient
service
which
I
would
be
more
than
happy
to
recommend
I
bought
what
I
thought
was
a
deal
on
some
Marc
Jacobs
perfume.
The
item
came
without
a
box,
seal
broken,
and
leaked
all
over
the
packaging.
I
wrote
them
an
email
(the
only
way
other
than
a
fax
that
you
can
contact
them)
a
week
ago
and
they
have
not
replied.
Poor
service
,lousy
product,
and
a
feeling
of
being
taken.
I
will
never
order
from
this
company
again.
And
I`m
$130.00
poorer
for
the
experience.
I
have
developed
a
great
relationship
with
herbies
over
the
years
and
have
a
lot
of
friends
that
have
followed
me.
word
of
mouth
works
out
the
best!!
They
have
kept
everyone
of
our
business
happy
.
I
have
seen
many
comments
on
here
and
people
can
be
kinda
"DUH"..

for
one
thing
herbies
is
NOT
the
breeder
and
therefore
can
not
control
the
freshness
he
is
presented
with
from
the
BREEDER!
and
of
coarse
the
mail
problems
is
all
HERBIES
fault
cuz
he
owns
the
mail
system
world
wide.
when
I
made
a
complaint
about
my
mail
it
had
herbies
address
.

to
much
indulgence
is
no
good

it

now
Pure

have
just
what
I

with

Loved

I
explained

then

had

a

gave

the

Amazing

just
what
i
was
looking
for!
Very
efficient
and
good
to
work
with.

I
placed
a
large
order
and
it
was
delivered
on
time
and
my
requests
dealt
with
confidently.

Would
not
hesiate
to
recommend.
I
spent
the
whole
day
researching
new
equipment
and
not
once
did
I
have
any
issues
with
the
site
and
check
out
was
easy.
I
dropped
my
laptop
and
shattered
the
screen
I
had
priced
replacing
screens
before
a
few
years
ago
and
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
just
replace
my
laptop
as
in
the
past
it
was
cheaper
to
do
that.
A
few
days
before
going
to
buy
a
new
i
googlled
laptop
screens
and
found
Laptopscreensnow.com
i
was
amazed
at
the
prices
i
placed
an
order
for
a
new
screen
and
received
it
in
a
matter
of
a
few
days.
It
took
me
less
than
10
minutes
to
remove
and
replace
the
screen
from
start
to
finish,
and
this
was
all
done
for
less
than
a
hundred
dollars
and
that
included
express
shipping.
I
will
definitely
use
them
again
in
the
future
should
i
have

It

It
saved
me
a

of
time
and
hassle

esp.
the
time
when
the
smoke
was
coming
out
of
the

Instead
of
towing
to

shop,
the
mechanic
fixed
it
right
outside
my
house.
picked

I
ordered
a
few
items
from
this
company
for
my
mother
for
mothers
day.
I
ordered
them

a
week
and
a
half
in
advance.
A
week
later
when
I
had
not
received
them,
I
contacted
the
company.

After
being
on
hold
for
over
5
min
then
cut
off,
I
called
back.

I
was
told
that
the
order
had
been
placed
and
sent
to
the
shipping
department.

It
had
not
been
shipped
yet,
but
was
being
processed!?

I
used
this
company
because
they
are
in
Georgia
and
I
like
supporting
the
local
businesses.
I
will
not
make
that
mistake
again.
Thank
you
for
the

the
next
day.

and
great
communication
Reliable
service
and
product.
Always
as
advertised!
I've
purchased
from
PureFormulas
several
times
now.
I've
received
my
purchases
quickly
with
no
problems
every
time!
These
folks
hands
down
had
the
best
deal
on
Aqualung
gear.

They
know
how
to
price
and
work
to
make
your
purchase
a
reality.

I
cannot
say
anything
negative
about
my
experience.

They
wanted
my
business
and
they
made
sure
they
got
it
and
I
got
the
deal
I
needed.
I
needed
a
new
radiator
for
my
truck.

I
checked-out
PartsGeek
and
they
had
a
good
price.

Nothing
great,
but

$11
less
than
my
local
supplier
and
I
knew
it
would
be
delivered
to
my
door.

What
they
failed
to
tell
me
was
that
it
would
ship
from
California,
7
days,
plus
the
one
day
it
took
to
process
the
order.

Eight
days
total.

No
option
to
expedite
shipping,
and
no
reason
for
me
want
expedited
shipping
since
in
the
past,
their
orders
have
reached
my
home
in
two
days
tops.

That
was
acceptable.

When
I
realized
from
the
tracking
info,
that
it
would
be
a
full
week,
they
could
only
be
contacted
by
opening
a
"Ticket"
to
discuss
the
issue.

Same
thing
with
the
order,
no
way
to
directly
get
shipping
info,
without
delaying
the
order.

They
should
have
red
flagged
the
order
when
they
knew
it
would
only
ship
from
CA
by
ground,
so
I
could
have
considered
this
fact.

PartsGeeks
is
out
of
my
list
of
options.

The

a

of
my

was
missing.

took
care
of
the
issue
quickly
and
professionally
and
resolved
everything
as

I

This
tour
was
such
a
fun
way
to
familiarize
ourselves
with
the
layout
and
major
landmarks
of
the
central
city.
The
tour
isn't
super
in-depth
in
terms
of
historical
detail
about
the
things
you
will
see
but
it
is
excellent
in
terms
of
seeing
the
city
from
a
super
fun
point
of
view.
And
the
clientele
is
great--lots
of
fun,
fit,
young
Americans.
Definitely
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
new
to
Paris.
I

Great

and
great

Always

The
whole
ordering

from

placing
the

was

easy.
Great

Ordered
a
new
bass
guitar
with
GAK
(always
the
'go-to'
guys
for
me)
and
was
promised
next
day
delivery.
Sure
enough
it
arrived
today.
These
guys
are
the
best.
They
have
the
best
prices
and
such
great
customer
service.
Their
shipping
system
is
a
bit
difficult
to
track
packages
online
but
they
always
work
with
you
to
make
it
happen.
Got
a
rental
car
in
Italy
off
Maggiore
Rentals
and
they
gave
us
a
near
new
508
Peugot
station
wagon
which
ran
immepably
and
very
reasonable
on
fuel.
I
received
the
parcel
within
5
working
days
and
I'm
on
the

side
of
the

Price
is
quite
reasonable
and
the
quality
of
the
products
is
just
as
excellent.
I
planned
a
week
long
trip
to
New
York
state
but
with
only
2
days
in
NYC.
The
first
day
in
the
city
I
used
the
pass
only
1
time
as
the
weather
was
bad
with
no
problem.
when
I
returned
2
days
later
I
found
the
pass
had
expired
when
I
tried
to
use
it.
I
did
purchase
2
days
but
no
where
did
the
fine
print
say
it
was
good
for
2
'consecutive'
days
only.
I
examined
the
paperwork
they
had
sent
and
the
web
site
and
nowhere
did
it
say
must
be
used
2
consecutive
days.
I
spent
the
day
paying
for
my
activities
as
I
didn't
have
the
time
to
pursue
solving
this
problem
and
the
discount
card
they
sent
had
NO
PHONE
NUMBER
to
call.
When
I
returned
from
vacation
I
sought
to
get
a
refund
but
they
fought
it
stating
I
did
use
it
ONCE.

I
don't
know
if
they
have
added
full
disclosure
on
the
policy
or
a
way
to
contact
them
in
the
event
of
a
problem
since
my
experience
in
the
Spring.
Hopefully
they
did.
I
am
sure
as
with
many
people
it
takes
a
leap
of
faith
to
make
major
purchases
online-
especially
with
a
company
you
have
never
dealt
with
before.
I
am
happy
to
report
G&S
online
was
a
pleasant
experience.
I
feel
the
prices
are
very
fair
and
the
service
was
quick.
I
will
purchase
from
them
again.

service
from
this
company
is
the

I've
come
across
anywhere............and
I'm
63
years
of
age!
The
a
fully
fitting
of
the
tyres
was
ok
but
charging
me
3
times
for
my
tyres
instead
of
2
is
unacceptable
and
caused
me
days
of
worry.
My
bill
should
of
been
300
pound
but
instead
they
took
450
out.
They
did
finally
refund
me
the
150
but
I
had
no
apology
and
no
attempt
at
any
kind
if
compensation.

Don't
think
I
can
trust
them.

Although
there
were
some
20
reviews
that
said
this
company
did
not
ship,
shipped
damaged
items,
and
tried
to
commit

in
one
way
or
another,
we
found
this
company
to
be
quiet
competent.

I
designed
custom
coasters
for
my
friend's
newly
completed
bar
in
his
home.

He
loved
them
and
it
was
something
that
he
did
not
have.
I
would
advise
you
to
get
square
trade
warranty
for
all
electronics
you
buy
or
order
online.
They
will
either
replace
your
defective
equipment
or
send
you
a
check
for
equal
value.
Trust
me,
it's
worth
it.
I
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
First4magnets.
I
ordered
my
magnets
from
their
website
(almost
too
much
to
choose
from!),
paid
my
monies
and
they
arrived
exactly
as
advertised
the
next
again
day.
I
bought
20
little
disc
magnets
and
they
came
well
packaged
in
a
sturdy
plastic
container
with
spacer
discs
between
the
magnets
to
prevent
chipping
during
transit.
I
don't
buy
a
magnets
all
the
time,
so
I
can't
compare
them
directly
to
anyone
else
in
the
same
line
of
business,
but
when
the
quality
of
service
is
this
good,
I
wouldn't
think
of
going
anywhere
else.
Highly
recommended.
The
service
was
very
nice
indeed.
The
questions
were
answered
quickly
and
free
of
confusion.
The
only
problem
was
the
shipping,
were
I
asked
for
a
quickly
dispatch
because
I
would
going
to
need
the
package
in
10
days,
there
was
a
email
confirming
that
but
after
all,
only
one
week
after
the
real
shipping
happened.
This
kind
of
error
have
to
be
addressed
because
it
made
me
think
everything
was
OK
and
only
one
week
after
I
realized
it
wasn't.
I
wore
a
full
beard
since
Viet
Nam.

Hated
shaving
and
swore
I
would
never
do
it
again.

When
I
decided
to
trim
up
my
face
so
my
wife
would
kiss
me
again
before
I
get
to
old
to
care,
I
went
to
using
her
throw
away
blades.

Always
hated
it
but
thought
that
was
just
what
shaving
was.
SHE
LIKED
HER
SAMPLE
OF
CANYON
LAKE
SO
MUCH
THAT
I
SEARCHED
FOR
THAT
BRAND
LOCALLY
WITH
MAJOR
BEER
AND
WINE
OUTLETS
IN
SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA,,.

I
HAD
NO
SUCCESS
UNTIL
I
USED
THE
INTERNET.

I
HAD
TO
HAVE
THE
WINE
SHIPPED
FROM
NY
TO
CA.
And
we
all
lived
happily
ever
after.
I
bought
a
key
safe,
it
was
delivered
quickly,
the
end.
Not
much
else
to
say
really.

I
bought
some
bright
green
snowboarding
socks,
they
arrived,
and
they
are
bright
green.

What
more
could
a
man
want?
We
are
a
family
of
two
adults
and
three
boys
under
11.
We
were
collected
from
our
hotel
before
daybreak,
by
a
very
polite
and
efficient
Spanish
driver,
who
spoke
excellent
English.
The
car
was
clean
and
the
drive
from
Benidorm
to
Alicante
was
smooth
and
uneventful.
I
would
heartily
recommend
Suntransfers
to
anyone.
Fast,
responsive
and
efficient,
with
good
technical
support
on
how
to
properly
use
the
equipment.

I

spot
on

very
happy
The
only
time
I
had
a
concern,
it
was
taken
care
of
immediately
and
politely.

Ordered
about
10
times
now
and
pricing
is
the
best
on
the
web,
do
a
comparison
and
you'll
see.

Use
the

to

bucks
off
of
the
shipping!

Lots
of
free
goodies
with
every
order
too!
Booking
process
is
easy
and
reliable.

User
ratings
of
hostels
are
a
good
guideline,
but
generally
reflect
relative
quality
for
a
given
destination.
This
is
the
first
time
I
have
used
Blackcircles.com.

The
website
was
informative
and
easy
to
use,
and
although
their
price
was
pennies
more
than
the
cheapest
supplier
I
found,
their
fitting
centre
was
closer
to
home.

The
online
followup
was
excellent
-
I
particularly
liked
that
they
gave
a
named
customer
service
advisor
in
case
of
difficulty.
Outstandingly
good
website
and
speed
of
delivery
just
as
good.
I
have
just
bought
quite
a
few
things
from
Simply
Scuba
to
replace
my
mostly
10
year
old
equipment
and
give
this
company
a
very
good
rating.
Just
slightly
slow
in
dealing
with
returns
but
you
can
feel
very
confident
that
they
will
sort
all.
I
think
this
is
good
way
to
travel
but
be
aware
that
there
are
some
hiccups
in
the
process.
I
once
had
to
pay
my
own
way
back
to
the
hotel
after
waiting
an
hour
and
a
half
at
the
airport.
I
continuously
called
the
hotel
to
pick
me
up
and
they
kept
saying
they
were
sending
someone.
I
won't
use
that
particular
hotel
again
to
fly
but
I
will
use
this
website
because
they
don't
all
operate
like
that.
I
purchased
a
diamond
engagement
ring,
and
two
wedding
bands,
in
January
2013.

Anthony
and
others
I
spoke
to
at
Brilliance
were
great
in
helping
me
choose
the
right
diamond.

The
rings
are
beautiful
and
shipped
quickly.

We've
had
them
independently
appraised
at
higher
than
the
purchase
price.

Thanks,
Brilliance.
The
website
was
easy
to
use,
even
for
a
man!
The
service
throughout
has
been
excellent
-
this
is
my
second
order,
and
the
goods
are
exactly
as
expected,
probably
even
better
than
expected!
I
ordered
a
CB
radio
and
antenna...with
so
many
choices
the
detailed
descriptions
and
reviews
on
the
web
site
made
my
choice
much
easier
and
I
could
not
be
happier.

The
price
was
lower
than
other
sites
when
you
consider
the
equipment
came
complete
in
a
package
with
no
need
to
purchase
other
support
items
not
included
with
the
radio
on
other
sites.
Having
used
shopto
for
a
while
now
among
other
sites
I
can
safely
say
it
is
the
top
of
the
lot,
out
of
7
I
use
it
is
the
best
value
on
new
products,
deals
and
bundles,
and
among
the
best
for
preorders;
concerning
arrival
time,
bonuses
and
price
guarantee.
The
top
was
delivered
very
quickly
,
and
of
course
delivery
is
free
,
which
is
always
a
nice
bonus
.

is
a
killer
sometimes.
My

within

It
matches
the
original
exactly
and
fit

just
as
it
was
supposed
to.
(One

had
smashed

On

outward
journey
I
was
kept
waiting
for
20
minutes
even
though
I
had
called
in
plenty
of
time
as
required.

I
understand
somebody
else
hadn't
collected
their

on
their

journey
which
was
creating
a

Notice
the

and
the

was
that

I
could
either
leave
the

an

have

I
advise

if
they

serious
about
watching

visit

they

help

David
Shuttle
did
me
proud,
very
fast
despatch,
very
well
packed,
along
with
free
delivery
and
a
special
offer.
Ist
class
alround.
Excellent
prompt
delivery,
just
what
i
wanted,
recommended
retailer.
We
liked
the
site
and
the
price
of
items.
However
after
going
through
the
procedure
of
ordering
the
product
we
entered
our
post
code
and
it
wouldn't
accept
it
tried
several
times
and
finished
up
ordering
by
telephone.
The
service
was
excellent
and
order
arrived
within
48hrs.
It
was
a
shame
we
were
frustrated
by
the
website!
ordering
was
easy,
and
the
delivery
next
day
which
i
thought
was
excellent.
However
at
this
time
of
year
you
would
expect
the
item
would
look
like
it
was
ready
to
give
as
a
present,
unfortunately
the
Hunters
Box
was
defaced
and
covered
in

grime
and
thick
dust.
i
rang
the
company
who
listened
but
no
too
sure
that
they
have
taken
any
notice!
i
used
to
buy
all
our
outside
walking
goods
from
Uttings
who
were
excellent
all
round
in
their
service,
unless
i
am
convinced
otherwise
with
at
least
feedback
i
will
go
back
to
Uttings.
Our
main
sewer
started
plugging
up

late
one
afternoon.
I
asked
Nertworx'
"Help,
I
need
a
plumber
bad,
NOW!".
Cody
called
me
within
minuets
and
stopped
by
within
the
hour.
He
promised
to
be
here
the
next
morning.
The
sewer

cogged
up
completely
later
that
evening.
He
and
his
mate
were
here
shortly
after
eight
the
next
morning.
They
encountered
a
huge
root
that
had
pushed
up
the
PVC
sewer
pipe
causing
it
to
clog
and
they
had
it
repaired
within
3
hours.
They
finished
a
bit
sooner
than
Cody
had
estimated
so
he
lowered
the
quoted
price!!!
How
many
guys
do
you
find
to
do
that?
Great
job!

Well
done!

Right
price!
Fast
delivery
and
great
product/
I
haven't
received
a
conformation
email
letting
me
know
my
products
have
shipped.
Its
been
a
week
since
I
placed
my
order..
I
still
haven't
received
my
order..
I've
ordered
from
these
guys
multiple
times.
I
love
the
price
match
guarantee.
Best
feature
ever.
I
know
some
other
sites
have
brand
exclusivity,
but
with
the
wide
selection
of
supplements
on
the
site,
you
can
find
always
find
a
similar
product
at
a
great
price.
The
shipping
was
fast
and
the
part
was
the
correct
one.
It
was
a
lot
cheaper
than
local
parts
dealers
wanted
for
there
parts.
Would
definitely
buy
again
from
Parts
Geek.
Rev
has
changed
my
professional
world,
where
I
am
currently
immersed
in
a
research
study.
My
ability
to
conduct
interviews
and
rely
on
the
Rev
app
on
my
iPhone
to
clearly
record
these
interviews
and
then
with
the
click
of
a
button
have
them
transcribed,
within
a
day
(at
most)
is
AMAZING!
Thank
you
Rev!!
Disappointed
-
no
doubt
a
great
item,
but
sizing
badly
wrong
for
main
garment
(and
the
free
gift
-
one
size
-
was
also
too
small
for
an
average
adult).
On
the
plus
side,
comms
from
Country
Attire
was
fine
-
emails
and
texts
with
a
one
hour
delivery
slot
-
but
the
upshot
is
that
I
have
to
take
time
out
to
return
the
package
to
a
Post
Office
some
distance
from
me
and
I
didn't
have
the
coat
I
wanted
for
a
walking
weekend.
My
suggestion
to
Country
Attire
-
if
a
coat's
sizing
is
unusually
small,
advertise
the
fact
more
effectively
-
I'm
a
42"
chest
and
a
XL
was
way
too
tight.
No
problems,
would
use
again!
Excellent
company
to
deal
with.
Choose,
pay
and
play.
I
have
ordered
textbooks
from
Bookbyte
for
4
years.
They
have
always
delivered
my
books
ahead
of
time
and
in
great
condition.
The
books
are
much
cheaper
than
some
of
the
other
online
competitors.
Moreover,
Bookbyte
offers
rental
option
so
I
don't
have
to
sell
my
books
back.
I
have
contacted
customer
service
numerous
times,
and
they
always
respond
within
24
hours.
I
highly
recommend
this
site
to
any
college
student
or
anyone
in
general.
I
found
this
on
line
and
had
just
replaced
my
IPhone
3.

The
information
on
line
was
clear
and
the
application
process
simple.

shortly
after
submitting
a
request,
the
free
post
bag
arraived
and
then
within
a
reasonable
time
the
money
was
in
my
account.

It
couldn't
be
simpler.
Site
is
frendly
and
easy
to
us
A
great
website,
an
easy
ordering
process
and
fantastic
service,
so
if
you
have,
as
I
do,
a
strange
obsession
with
your
choice
of
writing
implement,
then
this
is
the
place
where
your
dreams
come
true!!
Great.
Will
use
them
again
and
again.
The
shipping
was
really
slow
took
a
whole
week
to
arrive
at
my
door.
All
else
was
fine.
I
have
used
your
service
4
times
and
have
all
ways
been
pleased.
Whilst
the
product
I
bought
is
actually
made
here
in
Australia
I
was,
and
continue
to
be
unable
to
acquire
them
locally.
My
order
from
Vivomed
came
from
the
UK
quickly,
inexpensively
and
they
work
just
fine.
Thank
you.
Ordering
is
easy.
Each
time
I
have
bought
the
goods
have
been
shipped
the
same
day.
They
arrive
within
24
hours.
And
the
price
is
right.
Has
a
huge
selection,
but
easy
category
or
typed
search.
Usually
fast
to
deliver
I
recommend
you
book
your
next
trip
with
Travelocity
like
I
did.
Good
bed,
strong
solid
oak,
innovative
fittings
and
spot
on
delivery
service.
Black
Circles
offer
a
good
price
coupled
with
first
class
24
hour
delivery,
I
can't
fault
them.
5
star
range
is
great
value
for
my
office
needs.
Delivery
is
always
prompt.
Would
have
no
problem
recommending
Hunt
Office
to
clients,
friends
and
family.
The
best
prices,
quick,
safe
and
easy.
I
congratulate
you,
you
are
the
best
OEM
parts,
with
2
day
air
service
that
works!
You
won't
find
any
better!

the
ink.
its
fine,
would
like
to
have
been
able
to
track
the
shipment.
I
had
people
crying
for
Ink.
Telling
them
when
it
would
arrive
would
have
helped.
Second
order
with
B&H
and
thus
far
they
have
been
very
reliable.
I
ordered
some
surgical
masks,
and
they
arrived
in
a
timely
manner,
and
were
as
I
ordered.
I
am
perfectly
satisfied.
I
have
purchased
products
from
this
company
several
times
over
the
years.
The
stuff
they
sell
works
well,
and
the
service
is
prompt.
Good
business.
Great

amazing
delivery
heat

round
fantastic
thank
you
very
much

of
company

been
looking
for
o.k.
for
price
and
brillant

like
they
have
to
works

the
larger
items
i
paid
3
times
the
price
just
for
shipping
but
other
than
thay
great
customer
service
excellent
parts
The
checkin
process
was
done
in
a
way
that
makes
sense,
allowing
you
to
get
your
stuff
into
your
space
without
too
much
extra
hassle,
and
the
security
processes
made
me
feel
comfortable
leaving
my
things
there.

Many
of
the
other
storers(?)
I
ran
into
moving
in
had
been
there
for
multiple
years,
which
also
made
me
feel
better.
Ordered
a
HOG
Classic
2nd,
and
had
it
in
3
days.
Great
service,
fast
shipping
and
awesome
prices.
The
communication,
tracking
and
delivery
were
great,
really
looking
forward
to
using
this
over
Christmas.
What
a
delight
to
find
a
place
where
I
can
get
pencils
that
are
otherwise
only
available
in
the
"civilized"
parts
of
the
world,
i.e.,
out
side
of
the
US.

As
a
complete
"graphite
machiniac"
(someone
who
is
totally
absorbed
in
mechanical
pencils
using
graphite)
Cult
Pens
is
my
idea
of
the
perfect
place.
Switched
over
to
MrChewy.com
as
the
other
company
I
was
using
took
too
long
for
shipping.
MrChewy
said
2
days
for
shipping
and
on
the
2nd
day
it
was
at
my
front
door.
Petflow
is
great.
It
is
convenient,
and
delivery
is
always
on
time.
Very
flexible
with
delivery
schedule
also.
Easy
to
find
a
Weber
grill
tray
on
the
website
at
a
competitive
price.
Quick
delivery.
Will
use
Garden
XL
again
in
the
future
and
would
recommend
them.
They've
got
an
easy
to
use
website,
a
very
good
range
of
sports
products
and
quick
delivery.
Would
recommend
and
use
again
myself.
Ordered
a
jacket
which
was
delivered
promptly
the
next
working
day.
Exactly
the
sort
of
service
you
need.
Would
recommend
and
use
again.
The
Curve
RS-7
was
exactly
what
I
needed
to
replace
the
dinky
one
that
came
with
my
D800.
They
won’t
ship
‘old’
coffee.
I
ordered
a
driver
side
mirror
that
would've
cost
hundreds,
got
it
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost.
Shipped
when
it
said
it
would,
and
got
it
in
less
than
a
week
for
very
cheap
S
&
H.
The
part
was
OEM
and
a
perfect
match.
Would
definitely
use
them
again
&
reccomend
them
to
everyone!

I
found
the
product
I
was
looking
for,
and
placed
the
order,
expecting
it
to
arrive
within
the
time
frame
I
needed
it.

Nothing
on
the
web
site
showed
that
the
item
was
out
of
stock,
but
I
received
an
email
from
a
few
days
later
saying
the
item
was
out
of
stock,
and
on
order.

Had
I
known
that,
I
would
have
ordered
the
item
from
someone
else,
since
it
wasn't
going
to
arrive
on
time.

I
sent
an
email
to
the
company
notifying
them
of
the
issue,
and
asked
if
they
could
help
point
me
to
where
I
could
get
it
sooner,
but
I
never
heard
anything
back
from
them
until
the
product
shipped,
a
week
later
than
what
I
needed
it.
The
guy
that
helped
me
was
nice,
and
not
just
youre
the
customer
nice.
He
seemed
to
genuinely
want
me
to
get
not
just
the
most
expensive
tire,
but
the
best
tire
for
me.
I
will
definitely
be
returning
for
my
future
tire
needs!
We
called
to
order
food
for
our
2
dogs
when
we
realized
our
local
stores
were
completely
out

MrChewy.com
ensured
us
that
they
had
the
food
we
needed
in
stock,
and
we
would
receive
it
the
next
day.

We
did,
even
though
it
was
SATURDAY!!!!

We
are
so
happy
with
the
great
service
we
received,
we
are
going
to
continue
ordering
our

food
from
MrChewy!!!!!
Thank

much!!!!
I
have
always
had
great
luck
when
dealing
with
BHPhoto
I've
only
had
to
return

and
they
sent
a
replacement
before
they
had

received

I
would

great

overall,
also
cheap

just
don't
risk
yourself
by
pre-ordering,
this
kind
of

can
mess
up
on
those
at
times.
site

Give

Buying

Never

We
have
ordered
100's
of
custom
flash

from
Flashbay.

They

exceeded

Our

I
highly

A
friend
referred
to
legwearloft
as
I
was
struggling
on
what
to
get
for
a
few
cousins
and
my
sister...I
was
able
to
get
them
all
something
especially
for
the
colder
weather...they
ended
up
loving
the
mukluks
and
legwarmers
I
got
them...thanks!
Finding
a
business
that
actually
sells
quality
stuff
at
these
"wholesale"
or
"discount"
prices
is
great.
My
friends
and
I
order
bulk
stuff
from
clothing
shop
online
all
the
time
especially
for
our
intramural
sports
leagues.
I
was
referred
to
minitime
through
a
friends
family
and
was
very
impressed
by
the
amount
of
vacation
destinations
not
to
mention
hotel
deals
in
the
area
of
the
attraction.
It
was
helpful
to
read
the
trip
reviews
from
other
parents
about
their
travel
experience
and
definitely
had
an
impact
on
our
decision
where
to
travel
and
stay.
Bobby
the
owner
of
Altieri
Fine
Watches
&
Jewelry,
was
very
fair
when
it
came
to
trading
in
my
Rolex
Datejust
watch.
Him
and
his
team
was
nice
enough
to
walk
me
through
the
resell
process
and
showed
me
the
second
hand
market
price
and
how
they
based
their
quote
for
my
watch.
Ordered
around
15.00
delivered
next
day
around
11.00
now
that's

,currys
were
more
expensive

.
Driver
rung
to
say
he
was
near

was
clean
tidy
x
very
helpful
everything
was
fantastic
would
recommend
We
ordered
the
water
blade
and
was
really
clueless
as
to
what
we
needed
,like
the
way
they
suggest
what
you
might
need
etc
making
it
easy
to
complete
the
purchase
cheers
I
love
this
store
they
have
the
right
parts
and
the
best
prices
from
the
biggest
to
the
smallest.

My
1st
stop
is
parts
geek
before
any
parts
store
hands
down..
11
days
since
my
order
and
waiting,charge
my
card
the
same
day,then
credited
back,then
charged
next
day
again,that
was
on
nov.24
today
dec
1st
and
i
still
did
not

got
my
order,i
will
never
buy
anything
from
this
site.
I
looked
up
the
part
on

the
PartsGeek.com
website.

The
part
that
came
up
for
my
model
make
and
year
(the
only
choice
listed)
turned
out
to
be
a
trunk
lift
support
for
the
convertible
and
not
the
hatch
lift
support
for
the
hardtop
coupe
I
was
needing.

After
e-mailing
them
to
arrange
an
exchange,
they
said
they
would
send
me
an
RMA
within
4
days.

It
has
been
5
days
and
no
RMA.

They
have
no
parts
exchange
program
so
exchanging
a
part
takes
weeks
not
days.

Their
shipping
time
was
reasonable.

I
like
the
website
and
their
intent
seems
genuine,
just
not
overly
impressed.

I
will
most
likely
use
them
again
in
the
future
and
hope
for
a
5-star
experience...
:~)
Quick
an
efficient
Five
star
service
all
the
time,
very
helpful
staff
,
always
the
cheapest
prices!
&
fast
collection
and
delivery
too,
overall
great
company...
Thank
you...
Beware
that
if
you
buy
the
wrong
ink
cartridge,
you
only
have
30
days
to
return
it.
I
order
a
receiver
and
I
was
impress
on
the
timing
that
I
received
it,
on
time
to
install
and
keep
the
family
happy
just
in
time
for
playoffs,
thanks,
good
job.
We
found
booking
with
Easytobook
was
a
very
easy
procedure
and
will
certainly
use
them
again.
These
magnets
are
the
bees
knees!
They
are
easy
to
use
when
installing
heavy
paper
drawings.
They
look
very
stylish
and
discrete
and
come
in
a
variety
of
finishes
to
suit
every
situation.
Overall
great
experience.
They
had
an
issue
with
my
prescription,
pupil-something-or-other.
They
called
me
and
we
got
it
worked
out.
Glasses
arrived
MUCH
sooner
than
anticipated.
Couldn't
be
happier.
I
also
used
their
fall
coupon
to
get
a
good
chunk
of
change
taken
off
the
lenses
price!

It's
awesome
to
have
found
a
travel
site
that
provides
the
most
competitive
prices,
a
wide
variety
of
hotels,
tours,
and
activities
for
sale,
and
an
intimate
and
expert
knowledge
of
the
city.
Neworleans.com
is
the
"end
all,
be
all"
for
all
my
New
Orleans
travel.
Would
like
to
see
pay
pal
as
an
option
as
it
is
more
rust
worthy
than
other
options
I
have
used
I
have
been
using
the
Total
Primate
Care
for
several
months
now
and
can't
think
of
any
reason
not
to
endorse
them.

I
feel
like
crap
if
I
forget
my
TPC
in
the
morning.

I
also
use
the
Shroom
Tech
Sport
for
added
energy
during
workouts.

When
I
finish
a
2
hr.
training
session
I
still
have
energy
left.
I
drove
255
miles
round
trip
to
pick
up
my
bees
today.
It
was
a
nice
little
ride
and
when
I
got
to
Pigeon
Mountain
it
took
maybe
3
mins
to
check
in.
A
short
100
yard
drive
and
picked
up
was
a
breeze.
The
people
I
encountered
were
great
and
very
helpful
made
the
drive
well
worth
the
trip.
I
also
need
to
say
that
I
placed
a
mail
order
a
few
weeks
ago.
Everything
I
order
was
just
great
quality
and
it
arrived
on
time.
This
is
my
first
hive
and
Pigeon
Mountain
has
made
it
a
breeze.
Thanks
to
all
of
you.
Recipient
sent
us
a
photo
of
the
flowers.
They
were
beautiful.
Delivered
right
on
time!
I
felt
very
good
about
my
purchase.
Bought
the
mechanical
clutch
linkage
for
a
74
CJ.
I
really
did
not
need
the
bell
crank,
probably
the
most
expensive
part
but
I
could
not
figure
out
how
to
split
out
what
I
actually
needed
on
the
website.
The
"kit"
came
as
individual
parts
in
plastic
envelopes.
There
is
an
exploded
parts
drawing
but
it
was
not
labeled,
at
least
in
a
way
that
I
could
understand
so
I
gave
up
and
ordered
the
whole
thing
including
stuff
that
I
did
not
need.
Fast,
easy,
knowledgable
service.
Our
range
cooker
'expired'
two
days
before
Christmas.
We
got
the
identical
item
from
Appliances
Online
and
it
was
delivered
in
24
hours.
They
took
away
our
old
cooker
as
well.
Great
service,
good
prices,
clear
web
site.
Just
an
overall
good
experience.
Fully
satisfied
with
service
and
product.
It
was
a
fantastic
day
out,
plenty
of
buses
to
hop
on
and
off,
the
taped
commentary
was
very
useful
and
interesting.
Very
impressed,
turned
up
on
time
and
changed
two
tyres
in
twenty
..
No
complaints
at
all,

will
definitely
use
again..
Start
to
finish
no
issues
whatsoever,
in
fact
didn't
even
really
notice
the
parking
process
which
is
exactly
how
I
like
it
..
Just
joining
the
multitudes
praising
this
company,
cannot
fault
them
in
any
way
..
from
the
ease
of
the
website
to
the
speed
at
which
they
get
the
bag
to
you
-
keep
you
informed
of
the
status
and
transfer
the
money
..
Superb
company
!
Their
prices
are
very
good,
unquestionably
some
of
the
cheapest
around,
however,
once
the
order
is
accepted
it
all
rather
falls
apart.
they
send
u
an
email
with
an
overly
optimistic
estimate
of
delivery
date
(carefully
and
discreetly
adding
"subject
to
availability").
You
then
get
an
email
link
to
trust
pilot
requesting
you
rate
them
before
you
have
experienced
the
joys
of
their
off-shore
(i'm
guessing)
customer
services.
While
evidently
well-meaning
and
for
the
most
part
polite
and
patient
are,
as
far
as
I
can
tell
simply
reading
off
what
it
says
on
the
orders
part
of
their
website.
They
appear
to
have
no
additional
info,
thus
rendering
a
call
to
them
when
u
are
often
passed
to
voicemail
after
hanging
on
for
ages
utterly
pointless.
Hi,
tyre
received
in
good
time,
was
looking
forward
to
fitting
on
the
wheel
and
test
out
onthe
turbo
trainer,
only
to
find
the
normal
innertube
was
too
big,
so
had
to
wait
until
I
good
source
the
right
size
innertube.
Once
innertube
was
brought
and
fitted
with
new
tyre
I
have
been
happily
turbo
training
with
out
disturbing
the
wife
noise
wise.
It
would
have
been
helpful
for
your
website
to
ask
if
I
needed
an
innertube
to
go
with
the
tyre,
otherwise,
good
product
and
service
and
would
recommend
the
website
No
complaints
Very
fast
and
no
problems
happened.
Ordered
a
stethoscope
with
free
engraving
on
Wednesday
at
around
3
PM.
Tracking
it,
I
saw
that
it
started
to
ship
the
same
day
at
6
PM
and
it
was
already
engraved.
It
arrived
2
days
after.
This
was
all
with
normal
shipping,
too.
We
reorder
the
same
buttons
yearly.

I
have
asked
for
the
buttons
to
be
saved
so
there
is
not
a
set
up
fee
charge.

We
get
charged
every
time.

Where
is
the
love
for
the
repeat
customer?
Good
price
for
good
tyres,
but
I
did
get
"messed
about"
a
bit
on
delivery
dates.
Ordered
a
set
of
stickers
for
a
Triumph
Street
Triple,
I
paid
for
first
class
recorded
delivery
(£3.50ish),
as
I
was
in
the
middle
of
painting
a
bike
for
a
friend
I
expected
to
get
these
within
a
day
or
two
at
the
most,
after
having
no
sign
of
them
3
days
later
I
called
to
enquire
on
their
whereabouts.
The
guy
I
spoke
to
told
me
he
hadn't
"gotten
around"
to
doing
them
yet
and
that
he'd
been
planning

on
making
them
on
Sunday
to
post
on
Monday,
I
didn't
get
an
appology
either.
Stickers
finally
arrived
on
Wensday,
If
I'm
paying
for
something
like
this
and
I'm
charged
first
class
recorded
I
sort
of
expect
to
not
have
to
wait
over
a
week
for
them
to
arrive
because
someone
plainly
just
can't
be
bothered
to
pull
his
finger
out
any
sooner,
also
making
a
profit
off
the
postage
charges
is
a
cheap
thing
to
do
(postage
was
well
under
£2..the
envelope
didn't
cost
the
rest
I'm
sure).
Overall
the
stickers
where
pretty
good,
just
a
shame
I
had
to
wait
so
long
to
get
them,
I
would
have
used
you
again
but
sadly
after
this
sort
of
treatment
I'll
go
elsewhere.
awesome
job
and
great
products
Fast
delivery
and
reasonable
price
The
town
that
I
traveled
to
had
few
available
hotel
rooms
the
weekend
I
was
there.

One
full
hotel
gave
me
the
number
to
ReservationCounter.com
and
a
list
of
a
few
hotels
that
possibly
had
a
room.

When
I
called
ReservationCounter.com
they
found
an
available
room
but
I
was
hesitant
to
make
a
reservation
because
I
knew
nothing
about
the
hotel.

The
person
I
was
talking
to
hurried
me
to
make
the
reservation
before
the
room
was
gone.

I
did
reluctantly
make
the
reservation
rather
than
sleep
in
my
car
that
evening.

When
I
got
to
the
hotel,
the
room
I
reserved
was
not
available
and
I
had
to
take
a
room
that
I
normally
would
not
accept
(a
smoking
room).

The
hotel
did
give
me
a
cheaper
rate
(due
to
having
to
take
the
smoking
room)
than
ReservationCounter.com.

The
hotel
told
me
to
call
ReservationCounter.com
and
cancel
the
original
reservation.

I
called
and
tried
to
cancel
the
original
reservation
and
the
first
representative
hung
up
on
me
(to
be
fair,
maybe
it
was
a
mistake).

The
second
representative
did
cancel
the
reservation
but
still,
3
days
later,
the
charge
has
not
been
reversed.

To
make
it
worse
the
Days
Inn
hotel
that
ReservationCounter.com
sent
me
to
was
one
of
the
nastiest
hotels
that
I'd
ever
seen.

From
this
experience,
ReservationCounter.com
seems
like
a
company
out
for
a
quick
sale
with
no
concern
for
the
customer.
Read
above,
please.
Used
coppermine
earlier
and
this
made
life
so
much
easier
!
I
cant
recommend
this
site
enough
to
people
who
wish
to
buy
games
online.
It
is
always
working,
very
good,
trustworthy,
fast
moneytransfer.
I
am
really
satisfied
with
the
service....
I
have
purchased
photo
paper,
inks
and
lenses
from
this
company.
I
have
always
received
what
I
ordered
in
a
timely
manner.
So
far,
no
hitches
at
all.
I
recently
signed
up
for
Internet
and
Cable
and
everything
went
pretty
smoothly.

I
went
online
to
ask
a
few
questions
and
they
were
able
to
reduce
my
bill
by
removing
the
second
receiver
box
fee
which
was
great.

They
did
remove
my
HD
without
me
asking
them
to.

I
only
asked
if
they
could
give
me
HD
for
free.

I
called
back
and
they
should
have
reinstated
the
HD
back
at
the
$10
fee
per
month
starting
today.

Hopefully
it's
working
when
I
get
home
today.

Other
then
that
a
happy
camper.
Orders
are
processed
quickly,
the
staff
has
a
wonderful
mix
of
professionalism
and
kindness.
Great
selection,
reasonable
prices
and
very
fast
shipping.
Ordered
twice
from
partsgeek
and
everything
was
in
order.
will
defiantly
do
business
again
I
was
looking
for
some
uncommon
stainless
steel
blots
and
they
had
everything
in
stock
and
I
received
them
faster
then
I
expected.
Great
job
and
I
be
using
them
again.
The
website
was
easy,
and
delivery
was
here
almost
before
I
logged
off,
altogether
amazing
service
After
wrecking
the
side
wall
of
my
Michelin
pro4
service
tyre
with
a
bit
of
a
altercation
on
a
descent,
I
had
to
revert
back
to
my
conti
gator
skins
(very
good
tyres),
I
noticed
that
they
don't
roll
as
well
and
feel
hard
sending
road
vibration
up
trough
the
bike.
I
decided
to
try
the
vittoria
tyres,
these
are
excellent
I
have
done
a
couple
of
crit
races,
hill
climbs
and
a
bunch
of
distance
rides,
they
perform
brilliantly
in
all
applications,
possibly
not
quite
as
soft
as
the
pro4's.
I
wasn't
sure
about
what
to
choose
from
two
different
road
wheels,
so
after
a
couple
of
quickly
replied
emails
a
decision
was
made
and
I
went
with
the
stores
recommendations
and
was
very
happy
with
purchase.
The
wheels
only
just
turned
up
at
the
max
given

which
was
a
little
unfortunate
but
can't
be
helped.
The
fog
lights
worked
as
listed
.....very
satisfied
and
would
use
parts
geek
again.
I
made
one
shake
with
that
product
drank
it
and
couldn't
hold
it
down
threw
it
up
three
times
horrible
product
and
for
the
price
it
makes
it
that
much
worse.
This
was
the
first
order
that
i
have
placed
with
sinister
diesel.
I
ordered
a
coolant
filtration
system
for
my
powerstroke
and
the
staff
answered
all
of
my
questions
very
thoroughly
about
the
product.
Ive
ordered
many
aftermarket
parts
from
many
vendors,
&
sinister
has
been
the
friendliest
to
deal
with!
Definitely
have
my
repeat
business!
The
part
arrived
as
ordered,
no
problems.

However
I
suspect
the
manufacturer
has
altered
the
spec
as
although
it
works
it
isn't
quite
right.

I
won't
blame
Shower
Doctor
however.
Simple
order
of
pen
refills,
delivered
next
day
and
a
free
marker
included!

Can't
ask
for
more.
They
provide
a
good
fast
service
but
you
pay
for
it
as
their
service
fee
is
pretty
high.
Parts
Geek
has
always
provided
excellent
products.

The
products
are
exactly
as
they
describe
them.

It
is
easy
to
surf
their
website
to
find
what
you
want.

Their
prices
are
very
hard
to
beat.

Parts
are
always
well
packaged
and
arrive
in
a
very
timely
manner.

Parts
Geek
has
never
let
me
down.
Use
merlons
as
much
as
the
other
two
sites
I
use.
Good
service
and
good
prices.i
will
always
use
them
as
long
as
I
can
ride.
As
ever
Merlin
Cycles
provide
one
of
the
best
services
around.

Best
price
and
order
arrived
next
day
(unlike
some
other
bigger
online
stores
you
would
have
to
wait
for
a
week!).
Never
did
this
before.

U
tube
got
me
started
.

Replacing
he
first
strut
took
an
hour.

The
other
three
took
less
than
an
hour.

It
helps
knowing
what
to
do.
I
find
Western
Bikeworks
often
has
the
best
prices
on
the
web.

Their
specials
are
unbeatable,
coupons
are
combinable,
selection
is
great,
shipping
is
normally
free
on
orders
over
$75.

Give
Western
Bikeworks
a
try
today,
you
won't
regret
it.....
The
reception
lady
was
very
friendly
and
organised.
Offered
(expensive)
tea/coffee
from
the
vending
machine.

Comfy
seats,
spacious
waiting
room
with
a

window
on
the
workshop,
lots
of
(car)
magazines
to
read.

Workshop
supervisor
knew
how
to
start
my
car
too,
so
lots
of
experience!
We
requested
the
second
smallest
car
for
a
trip
in
Italy.

We
picked
up
the
car
in

Sorrento,
it
was
the
next
size
up
from
what
we
requested
(it
was
a
Lancia
Musa
with
more
than
75,000
km
and
quite
worn
tires,
scratched
up
and
top-heavy,
a
truly
horrible
car).

It
got
us
where
we
needed
to
be
and
I
enjoyed
our
tour
of
Italy
in
spite
of
it.

Trust
me,
in
Italy,
you
want
to
be
driving
the
smallest
car
possible,
especially
if
your
plans
include
seeing
Naples,
the
Amalfi
coast,
and
Sicily.

Problem
is,
when
we
turned
the
car
in
Palermo

we
were
charged
about
120
euros
extra
because
the
car
we
received
was
bigger
than
the
one
we
requested.
This
is
called
bait-and-switch
and
it
is
an
unscrupulous
business
tactic.

I
couldn't
argue
with
the
guy
about
it
since
my
Italian
is
minimal
and
the
agent
couldn't
speak
English
or
French,
so
I
just
ate
the
extra
bill.

It
won't
kill
me.

Still,
if
a
company
is
unable
to
provide
the
smaller
car
we
requested
--and
would
have
preferred--
they
should
still
honor
the
price.

Cars
provided
should
be
in
better
repair.

My
next
car
rental
in
Europe
will
use
a
different
agency.

It
is
also
worth
noting
that
nobody
was
at
the
place
in
Sorrento
where
we
were
supposed
to
pick
up
the
car
until
about
a
half-hour
after
we
were
scheduled.

That
kind
of
freaked
me
out
too,
since
our
entire
travel
agenda
was
predicated
on
having
this
car,
but
the
guy
did
eventually
show
up
and
was
actually
quite
friendly
and
funny.
Placed
order
on
a
bank
holiday,
had
a
couple
of
questions
and
wanted
to
add
to
the
order.
Was
surprised
they
were
open
and
everything
sorted
in
a
very
friendly
and
personal
way.
Will
now
not
use
anyone
else!
Was
surprised
at
how
quickly
I
received
the
order
and
all
was
as
ordered.
The
sirts
turned
out
just
right
and
the
artwork
is
excellent.
So
much
to
choose
from,
so
much
information.
I
was
impressed
from
the
moment
l
ordered
the
parts.
I
ordered
a
muffler
from
Partsgeek.com.

Even
with
shipping
it
was
$15
cheaper
than
anything
I
could
find
close
to
home.

The
order
experience
was
simple
and
fast.

They
confirmed
the
order
and
told
me
when
it
would
ship.

Got
here
right
when
they
said
it
would.

Highly
reommended.
Will
not
order
from
anywhere
else.
B&H
is
my
go
to
place
for
camera
supplies
and
sometimes
other
electronics
too.

Prices
are
keen,
shipping
is
often
free
for
smaller
stuff
and
no
tax
for
me.
They
have
everything
that
I
am
looking
for
and
they
offer
so
many
free
samples
so
I
can
evaluate
before
buying.
In
fact
this
is
my
second
order
and
I
am
buying
things
that
I
got
as
samples
in
my
first
order.
I
would
have
never
tried
them
otherwise.
They
were
excellent
quality.
I
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
online
but
have
never
had
as
good
experience
as
i
have
with
Supplement

send

on
a
Monday
to
see
exactly
how
long

take

one
observation:a
faster

will
make
this

a
very
strong
competitor.A
very
good

Eiffel

no

but
Fat

did!

YAY
I
deal
with
quite
a
few
online
companies
but
Doheny
outshines
them
all.
I
found
exactly
what
I
needed
at
the
BEST
prices
around....I
checked
everywhere.
Very
quick
and
easy,
delivery
options
were
fantastic....coming
from
a
John

employee
this
is
high
praise
indeed!
Will
use

I
was
told
of
this
website
from
a
friend
and
when
I
looked
on
the
website
and
the
amazing
prices.
Ive
ordered
almost
200$
of
stuff
from
supplementwarehouse
now
and
the
shipping
is
super
fast
and
worth
every
penny.
Try
it
for
yourself!!!!
Product
was
as
described
and
at
a
very
good
price.
Returns
policy
was
a
big
attraction,
but
not
needed.

Product
was
well
packaged
for
shipping
and
arrived
quickly
and
safely.
Very
helpful
in
store
without
being
pushy.
I
like
this
site
because
they
will
automatically
give
you
a
price
that's
5%
better
than
another
site
if
you
find
something
cheaper
somewhere
else
although
I
haven't
found
anything
cheaper
elsewhere.
Great
service,

great
friendly
employees.
Great
selection
at
the
best
prices
I
have
ordered
cameras,
laptop,
printer,
scanner,
microscope,
and
various
accessories,
etc.
I
have
yet
to
be
disappointed.
The
products
have
arrived
promptly
and
met
or
exceeded
my
expectations.
B&H
provides
great
service
and
good
value!
Der
Online
Kauf
war
einfach
und
direkt,
die
Lieferung
war
ebenfalls
wunderbar.
Meine
Freundin
war
begeistert.
I
found
Cultpens
on
Google
and
thought
they
really
looked
like
pen
experts
-
I
had
made
a
mistake
buying
cheap
refills
from
Ebay
before
and
thought
'Not
again!'
I
looked
at
a
few
sites
for
memory
for
my
Toshiba
laptop
and
Mr
Memory
was
one
of
the
few
that
actually
listed
my
model.

The
price
was
also
better
than
others
so
I
felt
confident
in
ordering.

The
memory
arrived
within
a
couple
of
days
and
was
easy
to
fit
with
the
helpful
video
lesson.

I
can
recommend
Mr
Memory
with
no
reservations.
This
is
the
second
time
I've
used
Boilerjuice
for
a
delivery
and
the
system
works
very
well.

I
always
get
a
number
of
quotes
and
this
time
Boilerjuice
was
again
the
cheapest,
provided
I
paid
by
debit
card.

The
delivery
came
well
within
the
quoted
period
and
was
from
one
of
the
companies
who'd
quoted
me.

The
previous
time
I
ordered
oil
Boilerjuice
wasn't
the
cheapest
so
I
will
continue
to
ring
round
for
quotes.

The
service
is
also
useful
for
the
regular
e-mails
which
keep
me
in
touch
with
general
oil
price
trends.
After
all
the
normal
shopping
around
SkyParkSecure
where
the
best
price
(by
at
least
the
price
of
a
couple
of
beers
in
the
airport).
The
booking
system
was
straightforward
and
got
the
Manchester
T2
multistorey
for
15
days

for
not
a
lot
more
than
any
of
the
long
stay
options.
I
ordered
a
muffler
from
them.
The
Bolt

website
makes
it
super
easy
to
find
even
the
most
obscure

The
company
also
supports
non

organizations
such
as
The
Geek

helping
to
inspire

of

Bolt

will
always
be

Would
highly

Great

I
purchased
the
trampoline
at
11.30am
and
it
arrived
the
following
day
as
promised,
It
only
took
me
and
my
wife
around
1
hour
to
put
it
up,
the
quality
and
style
of
the
trampoline
is
of
an
unquestionably
high
standard,
i
would
recommend
sport
and
leisure
uk
to
anyone
and
i
know
it
is
early
days,
but
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
many
years
of
fun
on
the
trampoline.
B+H
makes
it
easy
to
spend
your
money...items
are
in
stock,
pricing
is
good,
and
ordering
is
a
piece
of
cake...never
mind
the
free
shipping.
Would
recommend
these
guys.
It
sure
was
nice
not
driving
14
miles
round
trip
for
my
dogs
food.

Delivered
within
2
to
3
days
of
first
order
and
auto
delivery
is
very
easy
to
set
up
and
adjust
to
your
pets
feeding
needs.
Good
product,
great
delivery!
Top
class
service!
As
per
usual!
Having
tried
many
other
companies

I
found
these
guys
have
a
range
of
products
that
are
just
what
I
needed
with
great
taste
and
I
must
say
the
protein
shakes
do
exactly
what
they
say
on
the
packet
feel
great
after
taking
them
and
for
a
good
deal
of
time
after.
I
have
just
started
the
CLA
tabs
so
we
shall
see
if
these
are
just
as
good,
I
hope
they
are.
I
ordered
a

Edwin
Jagger
Double
Edge
Razor.
I
haven't
shaved
with
a
double
edged
razor
for
years.
My
previous
one
was
an
old
safety
razor,
Gillette
I
think
circa
1960s
that
I
used
for
years
and
could
adjust
the
blade
height
and
angle
on.
The
Jagger
is
straight
to
the
point,
no
frills,
and
unable
to
be
adjusted.
Initially,
I
was
a
bit
concerned.
However,
I
popped
in
a
blade,
lathered
up
very
well,
and
went
to
it.
I
could
tell
as
soon
as
the
blade
hit
my
face
that
the
blade
was
sharp
and
the
angle
perfect.
I
got
a
fantastic
extremely
close
shave
with
not
a
knick
or
cut.
I'm
very
impressed;
my
face
is
almost
as
smooth
as
my
girlfriend's
behind.
Almost.
Nothing
is
that
smooth.
And
by
the
way,
I
have
a
tough
thick
beard;
she
loved
snuggling
up
without
the
threat
of
whisker
burn.
Many
thanks
to

I
had
a
problem
at
the
beginning
with
my
reservation
and
economy
car
rental
did
a
great
job
to
fix
it.
The
Maggiore
in
Naples-Italy
is
always
one
of
the
best,
the
only
problem
is
that
you
need
to
take
a
bus
for
arrive
to
their
location
and
the
traffic
is
what
is
it!
We
drop
the
car
off
the
day
before
and
was
really
easy.
Of
course
we'll
be
back.
The
only
concern
is
if
the
Economic
Car
Rental
can
reimburse
the
exceed
to
the
car
rental
company
so
they
will
not
hold
so
much
money
for
your
rental,
it
would
be
awesome
to
rent
again
with
you!
Extensive
product
inventory,
easy
to
purchase,
what
you
want
when
you
need
it.
They
have
good
prices
and
they
get
the
parts
to
you
in
good
time.
Received

very
quickly
after
going
through
a
few
safety

Will
use

Excellent

I
bought
three
jackets
which
were
dispatched
quicker
than
I
thought
they
would
be
and
arrived
promptly.

We
kept
two,
one
for
my
eldest
son
and
one
for
me,
and
returned
the
third
via
the
postage
paid
envelope.

The
price
of
the
jacket
was
then
credited
back
to
my
card
without
request
from
me
and
all
is
well.

Very
easy
to
deal
with
and
all
very
straight
forward......odd
because
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
catch;-))
Nice
quick
service.
Yes
I
recommend
them..
Always
easy
and
a
great
price
My
mechanic
told
me
about
parts
geek.
He
suggested
that
I
buy
new
wheel
bearings
there
and
he
gave
me
the
names
of
the
best
manufacturers.

I
was
very
pleased
with
the
selection,
and
also
the
prices.
After
I
ordered
them
Parts
Geek
sent
emails
with
the
tracking
number,
and
status
of
my
order.
The
bearings
arrived
three
days
later
and
my
mechanic
installed
them
immediately.
Another
happy
customer!
B
&
H
can
be
trusted
to
offer
professional
videographers

me,
a
wide
selection
of
professional-quality
products.
I'm
especially
happy
that
they
accept
PayPal.
Everything
about
the
service
was
very
good,
from
the
service
in
the
store
through
to
communications
after
ordering
which
clearly
indicated
when
we
could
expect
delivery
(actually
quite
few
emails
and
texts!).
The
table
and
chairs
are
really
very
good
and
the
promotional
deal
was
very
good
value.
We
stayed
at
the
Thistle
Victoria
so
pick
up
was
just
outside
the
hotel.

Came
out
of
the
hotel
at
15:25
but
as
there
were
no
buses
waiting
we
decided
to
have
a
drink
in
the
pub
opposite.
Left
the
pub
at
15:45
as
a
bus
had
just
parked
up.
We
wanted
to
do
the
red
tour
but
the
bus
was
for
the
blue.
(There
was
an
issue
with
this
bus
as
it
stayed
put)

Not
a
problem
though
as
the
information
leaflet
specfied
tours
run
at
10-15
minute
intervals
although
we
knew
that
was
subject
to
change.

We
waited
for
30-35
minutes
and
3
or
4
buses
arrived
but
they
were
all
for
the
'blue
tour'.

The
driver
of
bus
that
had
parked
up
was
waiting
around
and
we
asked
him
when
the
'red
tour'
bus
would
arrive.

He
spoke
on
his
phone/radio
and
advised
that
the
bus
would
be
5-6
minutes.

We
waited
a
further
10
minutes
and
another
'blue
tour'
bus
arrived...swiftly
followed
by
another.

Overall
we
waited
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
for
a
'red
tour'
bus
and
because
of
the
delay
had
to
cut
the
tour
short
as
we
had
pre-booked
tickets
for
the
London
Eye.
We
appreciate
it
was
the
day
of
the
Olympic
marathon
and
we
were
expecting
minor
delays,
but
a
70
minute
wait
was
excessive.
extremely
easy
to
use
got
great
parts
at
a
cheap
price
and
quick
delivery.
i
would
recommend
this
site
to
every
one
thank
you
The
large
bug
was
that,
when
ordering
the
soft
copy
of
a
book
for
the
reduced
price,
it's
not
possible
to
modify
the
quantity
of
the
book
you're
ordering
(or,
if
it
is,
I
couldn't
find
it
and
it
wasn't
readily
available
on
the
website).
I
wanted
two
copies
and
had
to
place
two
separate
orders.
The
lay
out
of
the
website
is
first
rate.

I
like
all
the
features
that
makes
the
purchase
decision
easier,
ie
product
pictures,
filters,
comparisons,

info,
and
reviews.

The

no

I
am

The

There
is
a
reason
why
PHP
Designer
is
rated
so
high
above
other
IDEs,
It
has
everything.
It
has
an
FTP
client,
PHP
Manual,
PHP
live
syntax
checking,
popup
info
on
function
usage,
and
so
much
more!
The
layout
can
be
customized
to
any
developers
needs
or
wants,
along
with
changing
the
color
of
the
syntax.
It
supports
the
norm
of
CSS,
JS,
PHP,
HTML,
but
also
many
other
languages.
The
interface
is
intuitive,
easy
to
use,
and
fully
packed
with
useful

features.

Also
my
favorite
feature
is:
its
ability
to
beautify
code.
It
makes
your
code
much
easier
to
read
and
to
develop
with.
If
you
are
a
web
developer
seeking
for
a
good
editor
that
doesn't
cost
huge
amounts
like
Adobe's
products,
get
PHP
Designer!
I
personally
think
it
is
better
than
Adobe's.
Someone
I
trust.
I
ordered

late
one
afternoon
and
lo
and
behold
the
parcel
arrived
the
very
next
day
!
Now
thats
quick,
their
service
can't
be
bettered.
I
enjoyed
the
walking
tour
the
most
of
the
whole
"Big
Bus
Tour"
(BBT).
The
guide
was
interesting,
knowledgeable,
and
personable.
BBT
was
considerate
in
providing
free
rain
coats
when
it
rained.
The
audio
recordings
on
the
buses
were
good.
The
only
improvement
they
could
make
is
to
give
better
directions
of
how
to
find
the
tour
once
you
get
off
the
Heathrow
Express.
It
was
not
far
to
a
pick
up
spot
either.
It
would
have
been
nice
to
know
what
to
expect
once
I
arrived
at
Paddington
instead
of
wandering
around
until
I
found
their
bus
stop.
The
boat
ride
was
boring
because
it
took
so
long
to
get
going.
The
ride
itself
wasn't
too
bad.
To
save
time,
stay
on
the
bus.
Fast
and
easy
to
use.
Plus
I
love
the
online
deals
that
you
can
get!
pure

perfect

Excellent

guys
worked
hard
to
make
sure
the
price
was
and
the
professionalism
was
out
standing
going
out
if
the
way
to
make
me
happy!
thanks
town
fair.
The
reservations
processes
were
as
easy
as
any
rental
car
in
the
US.

The
cars
are
smaller
(luggage
capacity-wise)
than
what
we
thought
we
could
use.
Upgrades
were
much
better
and
reasonable.

The
Renault
Megane
used
in
south
of
France
is
an
amazing
car.
The
diesel
w/auto
shutoff
yielded
a
>50
mpg
(converting
from
km/l).
It
had
plenty
of
power
and
cruising
ability.

Very
quiet,
too.
Simple
ordering
and
checkout
The
rapid
reliable
service,
the
good
prices
and
great
products,
means
that
i
will
keep
coming
back
to
this
website
for
a
very
long
time.
Above
says
it
all!!!
I
was
very
surprised
at
the
PRICE,QUICK
NO
CHARGE
DELIVERY,
and
NO
SALES
TAX.
I
hope
everyone
is
served
that
well.
Partsgeek
has
cheap
parts
in
stock,
at
good
prices,
and
they
ship
quickly!

If
you
need
something
for
your
ride
(OEM
or
non-OEM),
they
are
the
ones
to
order
from.

I
couldn't
be
happier.
Much
Thanks!!
They
were
very
helpful
during
the
process
on
meeting
my
needs.
Thanks
for
everybody
Frankly,
I
paid
about
$100
for
a
warranty
that
cost
me
$100
later
to
have
my
daughter's
phone
repaired.

So
in
the
end,
I
basically
paid
$200
for
a
used
phone.

(I
could've
just
tossed
it
and
bought
a
new
Moto
G
for
$180.)
Im
Sorry
My
Other
Review
Was
Wrong,
I
can't
even
re-fill
cartridges
at
COSTCO
for
the
price
I
can
buy
them
new
at
InkFarm.
I
ordered
an
intruder
alarm
for
my
daughter,
excellent
choice,
competetive
prices,
rapid
delivery
checked
out
prices
on
the
internet,
reidys
came
out
equally
as
good
as
other
outlets,
however
they
were
offering
free
headphones
with
the
amplifier,
which
is
a
bonus
when
you
have
to
practice
at
home.
i
would
definately
use
reidys
again
in
the
future
when
i
will
be
looking
for
a
new
guitar
They
are
the
real
deal.
Love
the
service.
The
customer
service
is
great
as
well!!
We
received
a
friendly
and
helpful
reponse
to
our
initiakl
enquiry
and
Atlantic
Signs
were
able
to
supply
our
need
quickly,
and
delivered
the
product
at
a
good
price
and
exactly
with
the
time
frame
that
they
had
promised.
The
order
was
efficiently
and
promptly
dealt
with
and
dispatched
The
best
I
have
found.
The
staff
were
excellent
and
very
friendly

and

the
delivery
eas
very
fasr.
Ordered
a
Lavatube
premium
kit
on
27th
Dec
2011
-
it
arrived
a
week
later
-
appreciated
it
was
christmas
so
delivery
took
a
while
longer
but
was
kept
updated
as
to
the
status
of
my
order.

Lavatube
itself
is
a
fantastic
bit
of
kit
for
the
price
paid
and
I'm
happily
sat
vaping
on
it
as
I
type.
I
was
looking
for
a
part
for
my
uncle
who
does
not
have
internet
access.
The
part
he
needed
would
have
cost
three
times
as
much
from
the
Volvo
dealer.
I
got
the
part
for
a
third
of
the
price.
Great
place
to
find
hard
to
find
parts
for
foreign
cars.
Great
Job
fellas.
It
works
well
for
me
and
they
have
what
I
am
looking
for.
Parts
Geek
had
a
wide
selection
of
what
I
was
looking
for
and
the
parts
fit
perfectly.
A
very
positive
experience.
B&H
always
has
what
I
want
at
competitive
prices.

Excellent

marvellous
product,
grrrreat

Expected
what's
to
be
expected...what
I
ordered
and
great
service
lovely
company
to
do
business
with...
cant
recommend
highly
enough
!
Ordered
my
Euphoria
Overdrive
on
the
Friday...it
was
with
me
on
the
following
Monday.
Website
was
safe
and
secure
with
a
fantastic
array
of
Guitars..Amps...Effects
ect
on
display.
Spoke
to
"Rick"
on
the
phone
who
was
most
helpful.
Will
defiantly
be
using
Toneworld
again
in
the
near
future...
And
will
recommend
to
my
musician
buddies
!!
Have
used
GAK
on
a
number
of
occasions
...
always
a
great
site
to
order
from.
Fast
turnaround
too
:)
1
small
part
was
missing
but
we
used
an
old
1
so
no
problem,
it
looked
like
(the
srinkrap
was
open)
it
may
have
been
returned
pads
and
1
little
spring
didn't
get
returned.
I
will
definitely
use
PartsGeek
again.
my
only
negative
experience
was
setting
us
a
limo
service
for
a
recent
trip
to
NYC.

The
pick
up
there
was
good
the
return
never
showed
up.

I
asked
for
refund
as
I
resorted
to
a
taxi
versus
miss
my
flight
and
I
have
not
had
any
of
my
calls
returned
by
that
limo
service.

They
are
not
honest
and
did
not
refund
my
money.
The
purchase
experience
was
good
and
rounded
from
the
ease
of
purchase
to
the
text
from
the
driver
to
notify
a
delivery
time.
Have
found

Vet
Approved
to
be

an

I
Thank
You
.!!!!!!!!!!
Product
is
good,
home
delivery
is
convenient,
I
would
like
an
email
sent
1
week
ahead
of
time
explaining
the
order
with
a
way
to
modify
the
order
online..
Called
to
file
claim
on
a
computer
and
set
time
to
call
after
4
pm.
Guy
kept
calling
in
the
morning
when
we
were
not
available.
Had
to
call
back
probably
3-5
times.
Finally
had
to
talk
to
a
manager

to
get
anywhere
and
even
that
took
two
times
to
finally
get
them
to
call
at
the
correct
time
to
get
the
computer
fixed.
From
start
to
finish
was
1
month,
even
when
there
policy
states
it
is
repaired
within
5
business
days
or
you
get
your
money
back.
In
my
opinion
it
was
a
very
unacceptable
experience.
If
the
repairman
kept
closing
the
ticket
you
should
have
called
or
emailed
to
find
out
what
the
problem
was.
Fortunately
the
computer
is
fixed
now,
unfortunately
I
still
have
a
warranty
on
this
computer
and
another
one
with
you.
Hope
and
pray
I
never
have
to
use
it
again!
Once
you
admit
to
yourself
that
you
are
in
financial
hardship,
then
contacting
Harrington
Brooks
is
good
for
you,
they
treat
you
like
a
person
not
a
leper,
they
advise
you
all
the
way.
I
originally
started
a
Debt
Management
Plan,
then
went
to
an
I.V.A.,
although
you
do
pay
a
small
fee,
this
is
not
much
and
they
do
all
the
work
for
you,
this
take
the
weight
of
your
debt
off
of
you.
Music
Magpie
is
easy
to
use,
just
type
or
scan
in
your
items,
like
CD's
and
DVD's,
I
was
hesitating
to
purchase
an
non-OEM
salt
cell
from
an
online
reseller,
due
to
the
potential
issues
and
having
to
deal
with
returns.
Poolsupplyworld.com
was
great
-
excellent
price,
quick
delivery,
product
that
works
as
advertised,
and
corteous
service
with
personal
follow
up.
I
will
certainly
use
this
pool
supply
web
store
again.
I
found
a
lower
price
for
the
tires
I
wanted.
They
beat
the
other
guys
price
no
problem.
I
made
an
appointment
online
and
everything
went
smooth.
In
and
Out!
I
travel
quite
a
lot
and
Golf18
makes
it
easy
to
find
playable
courses
throughout
the
US.
When
you
show
up
at
the
course
there
is
never
a
hassle
with
payment.
I
have
used
Golf18
and
never
had
any
problems.
Truly
excellent
service
Tahoe
Mountain
Sports
offers
easily
navigable
site
,
a
good
selection
of
products
and
excellent
service.
My
selections
were
shipped
promptly
and
arrived
safely.
I
bought
2
mitchelin

tyres
for
my
motorcycle,

I
saved
at
least
10
quid
and
the
tyres
were
delivered
to
my
door
the
next
working
day.
Value
for
money
and
a
speedy
service
all
in
one.
I
will
certainly
use
Black
Circles
again,
and
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
tyres
at
a
genuinly
competative
price.
We
had
a
hard
drive
failure
and
Fields
Data
was
able
to
recover
the
data
for
us.

We
found
the
price
a
bit
steep--$800
rather
than
the
$199
in
the
ads,
but
they
were
willing
to
work
on
a
private
and
non-corporate
issue.

We
had
quotes
of
$2000
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
from
more
corporately
oriented
companies.

We
sent
in
our
hardware
and
we
got
the
diagnostic
and
results
as
promised.

However
communication
was
not
all
it
could
be--results
could
only
be
viewed
with
Chrome
browser
or
Safari--and
that
was
not
specified.

Once
we
knew
this,
we
could
see
from
their
report
that
the
data
we
were
interested
in
was
recovered,
and
we
happily
gave
them
our
credit
card.

But
we
were
not
informed
that
by
paying
with
a
credit
card
we
would
incur
a
overseas
transaction
fee
because
the
charge
was
by
a
British
bank,
so
$25.00
was
added
to
the
$819
quoted
which
we
were
not
expecting.

Had
we
known
this

we
might
have
chosen
another
kind
of
payment.

We
gave
them
authority
to
charge
our
card
on
1/14/2014,
but
we
did
not
receive
our
data.

We
called
the
recovery
specialist
using
a
cell
phone
he
was
not
familiar
with
he
answered
and
told
us
that
his
office
had
had
a
hard
drive
failure
of
their
own.

Once
again
he
promised
to
send
the
data.

When
we
got
our
credit
card
statement
without
any
e-mail
that
the
data
had
been
shipped,
we
disputed
the
charge.

The
next
day,
we
had
an
e-mail
that
the
data
had
been
shipped,
and
4
days
later
we
got
the
DVD
with
the
data.

We
then
un-disputed
the
charge.

On
the
whole,
our
experience
was
positive
with
regard
to
performance,
unsatisfactory
with
regard
to
communication,
and
OK
with
regard
to
cost.

The
specialist
tried
to
blame
delays
on
our
only
having
given
him
a
PO
Box,
but
we
were
never
asked
for
a
physical
address.

We
had
asked
to
have
the
data
shipped
with
tracking
info
but
this
was
not
done.

Finally
the
data
arrived
by
USPS
priority
mail
about
2
days
after
we
were
told
to
expect
it.

All
our
mail
comes
to
a
PO
Box.

Even
the
UPS
drivers
occasionally
drop
packages
off
at
the
post
office
for
our
PO
Box.

On
the
whole,
our
experience
was
positive
with
regard
to
performance,
unsatisfactory
with
regard
to
communication,
and
OK
with
regard
to
cost.


The
company
delivered
on
its
promises
finally,
and
possibly
under
pressure.

They
could
work
on
their
communication
with
customers
would
be
our
main
criticism,
but
on
the
whole
we
would
recommend
them.
I
have
been
ordering
my
supplements
from
Supplementwarehouse
for
years
now.

I
have
saved
tons
of
money
and
have
had
no
problems
with
customer
services.
Accidentally
hit
a
mailbox
and
knocked
my
passenger
side
mirror
off!
I
looked
around
these
guys
have
the
lowest
price
and
they
were
very
good!
I
ordered
a
new
PC
from
Dinopc,
I
was
given
all
the
details
of
cost
as
I
selected/upgraded
the
spec,
on
completion
of
my
order
I
was
sent
an
email
confirmation,
I
was
also
given
details
of
how
to
check
the
build
progress
and
on
completion
I
was
sent
a
tracking
number,
it
did
take
over
2
weeks
but
that
was
not
the
fault
of
dinopc
that
was
due
to
a
4
day
bank
holiday,
once
my
pc
arrived
it
was
expertly
packaged
and
everything
was
as
I
had
requested.
I
am
more
than
happy
with
the
service
that
Dinopc
provided
and
i
would
strongly
recommend
them
to
anyone.
I
have
not
had
to
use
there
customer
helpline
so
I
can't
really
comment
on
it.
Good
services
came
quick
I
had
been
saving
my
pennys
for
a
very
long
time
and
eventually
had
the
funds
to
purchase
my
dream
amplifier.
Gak
were
helpful,very
quick
prossesing
my
order
and
it
was
as
easy
as
making
a
phone
call.
Well
done
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
i
will
without
a
doubt
recomend
you
to
anyone
and
i
will
be
back
for
more
goodies
soon.
many
thanks

My
October
2013
order
for
a
Mitsubishi
mini
split
arrived
well
packaged
but
was
missing
the
stand
on
which
to
mount
the
condenser
unit.

I
phoned
the
toll
free
number
to
report
this
but
still
have
not
received
a
call
back
or
email
concerning
this
issue.


This
charge
will
be
disputed
with
my
credit
card
company
and
the
condenser
stand
reordered
from
another
supplier
if
it
is
not
sent
immediately.

Its
holding
up
the
install
process.

I
can't
recommend
this
firm
at
this
time.
Phoned
first
&
got
excellent
advice
on
the
product
i
wanted.
Always
quick
service
with
the
best
prices
A++++
I
called
Mammothhobbies.com
to
discuss
some
information
I
needed
to
consider
my
first
rc
truck
purchase.
They
were
so
helpful
and
knowledgable.
They
not
only
had
the
best
price,
but
they
sent
me
all
kinds
of
free
stuff!
(Charger
upgrade,
stickers
and
a
$5
coupon
voucher)

I
have
recommended
their
site
to
at
least
3
people
since
I
made
this
$400+
investment
a
few
days
ago.
Thanks
again
guys.
You
will
be
receiving
all
of
my
business!
I
bought
a
udu
drum
from
GAK.
They
kept
me
up
to
date
with
my
order
as
promised,
and
the
price
was
great.
Fantastic
instrument,
and
service.
loeshop.dk
er
virkelig
overskuelig
at
anvende,
og
servicen
er
i
top.
Jeg
skrev
til
dem
angående
en
salgsfaktura
efter
et
køb
på
webshop,
og
fik
svar
efter
maks
en
halv
time.
Endvidere
fik
jeg
besked
på
dagen
om
at
Postdamnark
ville
levere
min
pakke!
Jeg
er
ovenud
tilfreds
med
den
service
de
har
ydet,
og
det
er
bestemt
ikke
sidste
gang
jeg
handler
hos
dem.
Nem
og
overskuelig
side.
Vildt
hurtig
levering.
Meget
tilfreds!
The
service
was
great,
and
i
received
my
package
the
the
day
after
i
ordered
it!
I
like
the
part
geeks
got
the
parts
they
were
right
and
got
them
faster
the
expeted.i
will
order
from
them
again.
I
am
happy
with
the
products
and
pricing
but
the
packing
on
my
last
3
orders
and
this
one
is
poor.
The
boxes
all
arrived
either
torn
open,
crushed
and
mangled.
Nuts
and
bolts
were
missing
in
one
box
and
the
replacement
box
of
that
item
also
had
been
damaged
with
pieces
missing.

I
just
bit
the

bought
he
missing
parts
at
the
hardware
store.
The
boxes
they
used
were
not
sufficiently
rated
for
the
items
being
shipped.
Customer
service
has
always
been
super
helpful
and
cordial.
Nothing
was
damaged
or
missing
from
this
order
and

I
would
still
buy
from
them
because
of
the
price
&
products.
My
juicer
was
delivered
from
the
UK
to
Spain
in
record
time.
Always
find
products
in
stock
and
competitively
priced.

Shipping
and
billing
are
flawless
and
I
continue
to
do
business
with
B&H.
In
short:
I
will
be
back
to
order
again
I
have
ordered
many
items
from
B&H.
From
dollars
to
thousands
of
dollars.

I've
always
felt
secure
ordering
from
B&H.
The
items
were
shipped
fast,
and
always
as
described.

B&H
is
my
#1
online
shopping
store
for
camera

Key

just
the

you
need
delivered
superfast
and
at
a
kickass

would
highly
recommend
and
will
be
using
again!
I
choose

It's

I
loved
its

This
was
my
first
time
using
this
site.
The
process
was
quick
and
easy
but
I
was
disappointed
to
be
sent
the
wrong
frames.
Although
it
was
the
same
brand,
the
style
and
prescription
were
wrong.
The
customer
service
representatives
were
helpful,
especially
Nicole
who
answered
my
call
several
times.
I'm
quite
happy
with
the
frames
but
I
hope
this
issue
doesn't
happen
often.
Sceptical
at
first.
They
were
the
best
price
on
line
and
very
fast
delivery.
I
will
be
using
this
company
again.
The
prices
on
Victoria
Plumb
are
always
good,
and
as
a
Trade
Customer
we
are
eligable
for
next
day
delivery.
However,
why
pay
extra
for
delivery
on
Tuesday
instead
of
Wednesday,
when
it
turns
up
on
Wednesday
anyway?!
No

I
purchased
XBOX

at
a

and
it
was
delivered
instantly
I
wanted
to
replace
the
LCD
panel
for
my
Asus
G75
ROG,
which
had
the
notorious
defect
where
striped
lines
show
up
in
dark
areas.
Asus
themselves
wanted
to
keep
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks
for
diagnosis,
and
refused
to
simply
replace
the
panel
even
though
it
was
a
known
defect
(and
a
ten-minute
job).
Enter
laptopscreen.com;
a
quick
search
for
my
laptop
model
brought
the
right
product
to
my
attention.
It
fit
perfectly
(am
using
it
now)
and
was
delivered
quickly
and
cheaply.
Good

I
bought
a
Fender
Squier
Bullet
HSS
strat
and
it
arrived
when
GAK
said
it
would,
carefully
packed
and
the
guitar
is
excellent,
though
I'm
still
finding
where
the
tones
are.
I
would/will
use
your

again
and
I
will
recommend

My
only
gripe
is
that
having
paid
for
a
delivery
slot
of
midday
to
5pm
as
I
was
going
out,
this
was
amended
to
a
latest
of
5.15
leaving
me
less
time
than
was
comfortable.
Having
said
that,
it
arrived
at
exactly
5.15
and
the
delivery
men
could
not
have
been
more
helpful.
They
had
a
lot
of
stairs
to
contend
with
but
they
they
were
very
cheery
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
running
an
hour
and
a
half
late
and
didn't
expect
to
get
home
until
10.00.
They
deserve
full
marks
and
I
would
happily
use
AO
again
and
will
recommend
them
should
the
need
arise.
These
trousers
are
great
-
just
what
I'd
expect
from
Berhaus.
They
are
light,
totally
waterproof
and
so
easy
to
put
on
when
things
turn
nasty.
I
haven't
tried
the
whisky
as
it
was
a
present
but
perhaps
I
will
before
long.
All
I
can
rate
is
the
delivery,

which
was
very
quick
indeed
and,
and
the
packaging
which
was
about
as
safe
as
it
could
be.
Below
average
prices,
extremely
quick
and
great
service.
Will
use
again
and
again.

I
just
ordered
flowers
for
my
mum
for
Mother's
Day
in
England
on
Sunday.
It
was
really
easy
to
navigate
the
website,
and
there
was
plenty
of
choices
available
even
though
it
is
only
a
couple
of
days
before
Mother's
Day.
I
could
have
even
had
them
delivered
the
same
day,
but
chose
Saturday
instead.
Overall,
I
was
very
happy
that
I
managed
to
sort
this
out
without
any
problems.
Hostelworld
is
truly
a
backpackers
best
friend
abroad.
With
the
Lonely
Planet
guidebooks
being
so
poor
so
these
days,
it
has
been
important
to
me
to
supplement
its
material
with
an
outside
source,
especially
when
it
comes
to
accommodation.
What
makes
the
site
so
useful
is
its
candid
reviews
from
fellow
travelers,
which,
in
my
opinion,
is
the
most
reliable
feedback
you
can
get
and
the
ability
to
check
availability
and
reserve
a
bed
in
just
a
few
clicks.
A
highly
reccommended
website
for
accommodation
bookings.
Easy
navigation,
good
descriptions,
fast

a

experience.
I
will
certainly

was
processed
immediately
and
I
received
my
shipment
in
just
2
days,
when
I
expected
it
in
about
a
week.
The
parts
work
great.
I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
It
was
my
mistake
when
I
ordered
the
wrong
size
helmet.
Phil
was
helpful
in
checking
out
my
returned

and
getting
me
the
right
size
helmet
shipped
out
the
same
day.
Great
service!
Good
product.
Rivals

nicely.
I'll
continue
to
shop
here.
Couldn't
beat
the

offered,
not
even
with

Hard

than
this

was.
I
was
looking
for
storage
in
SoCal
and
there's
hundreds
of
options.
I
came
across
SpareFoot
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try.

I
had
a
great
experience.
A
young
lady
named
Story
helped
me
and
she
was
wonderful.
In
short
order
she
was
able
to
tell
me
my
options
based
on
my
requirements
and
then
got
me
a
nice
discount.

This
is
the
only
way
to
shop
for
storage.

the

Good

Cult
Pens
is
still
my
favourite
site
for
all
things
pen/pencil.
A
great
range
covering
new
and
rare
objects
at
good
prices.
I
always
check
the
B&H
website
as
their
prices
are
seldom
beat
by
other
sites.

Service
is
always
great,
too!
I'm
very
pleased
with
the

The

is
very
well
designed,
it
is
easy
to
find
the
information
one
is
looking
for.
It
is
also
very
straightforward
to
place
and
submit
your
reservations.
The

a

Tripping
made
the

and
quick.
Now
on
my
trip
I'm
happy
knowing
I
found
the
best
house
among
all
the
different
rental
sites.
Their
website
was
super
easy
to
use
and
I
was
able
to
filter
to
find
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for!
I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
Have
used
this
company
before
so
knew
what
to
expect.
They
didn't
disappoint
me!
Will
continue
to
use
them
in
the
future
for
special
occasions.
Many
thanks.

This

I

10/10
I
ordered
the
barbecue
cover
as
it
was
an
Outback
one
at
a
very
reasonable
price.
I
am
disappointed
with
the
delivery
timescales,
particularly
as
throughout
the
time
I
awaited
delivery,
your
website
clearly
showed
it
in
stock!
This
is
deceipt
as
it
should
not
have
been
shown
as
being
in
stock.
I'm
sure
your
website
could
have
been
edited
quite
easily
to
reflect
this.
However,
I
now
have
received
the
item
and
am
satisfied
with
it.
I
would
seriously
think
twice
before
placing
any
more
orders
with
you,
and
would
not
recommend
you
to
friends.

The
jacket
I
bought
is
very
stylish
and
very
high
quality.

I
do
have
a
few
comments,
first,
my
inquiries
made
via
email
were
never
answered
and
second,
the
website
is
not
always
functioning
properly
and
I
had
a
problem
placing
my
order
on
a
few
occasions.
I
purchased
a
battery
and
screen
for
my
EVO
but
both
products
did
not
work.

The
top
of
the
screen
does
not
respond
and
the
battery
was
completly
dead
with
.5mil
volts
that
would
not
charge.

They
will
not
take
back
the
screen
once
its
used
but
how
do
you
know
it
works
until
you
replace
it.
Sold
two
n95's
to
Mazuma
that
would
have
otherwise
sat
collecting
dust,
very
helpful
service.

This

Definitely

The
parts
I
have
received
so
far
have
been
very
good.They
all
have
fit
like

far
it's
been
all
good
.
I
will
get
more
parts
from
parts
geek.com
no
worries.
I
have
had
numerous

experiences
with
PartsGeek.
1001
model
kits
really
came
through
for
me
on
some

I
had
been
searching
for.
The
communication
was
great,
and
even
though
it
took
a
little
time
to
get
the
decals
I
was
full
aware
of
what
was
going
on.
The
service
was
as
good
as
the
communication,
and
when
the
order
was
shipped
it
arrived
quickly
and
in
great
order.
I
will
shop
there
again.
really
good
service
I've
been
buying
my

from

for

The

is
always
great
and
the

are
fair.
Way
too
much
noise
in

at

center.
hard
to
hear

Found
out
call

was
not
a
Marriott
center
but
an

center.
Rep
was
helpful
and
efficient
in

whilst
i
think
the
product
is
quite
good,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
aftersales
doesnt
live
up
to
the
product!!
Helpful
staff
and
very
prompt
delivery;
they
have
always
had
the
stock
in
that
I
need.
Easier
than
goingb
to
my
local
stockist
who
always
have
to
order
in.
Yet
again,
helpful
staff
,
well
priced
good
quality
goods,
efficient
delivery;
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend.
That's
funny
but
the
vast
majority
of
my
purchases
were
things
like
bags,
wallets
etc
instead
of
music
stuff.
And
always
everything
comes
in
time
and
in
good
condition.
So.
Big
Up.

I
ordered
a

cap
with

A

was

An

was
issued
for
the
part,
but
shipping
was
75%
of
the
total
cost
and
not
reimbursed.

Not
a
good
policy.
Outstanding
price!
But
a
little
slow
on
the
delivery.
But
will
continue
to
buy
here!

The

was
every
bit
as
good
as
described.
Great

great
price
and
great
service,
thats
all
I
have
to
say!
i
love
their
service
I've
been
using
them
for
a
number
of
years
and
always
found
them
to
be
extremely
helpful
and
reliable.
Appliances
online
provided
an
exceptional
service
from
start
to
finish.
Not
only
were
they
one
of
the
cheapest
around,
they
also
went
the
extra
mile
to
get
the
items
delivered
to
a
central
London
location
with
extremely
limited
access.
This
is
the
best

I
ever
used,

I
also
love
the
computer

and
other
options
I
would
highly
recommend.

I

I

I
phoned

They
answered
immediately
and
informed
me
that
everything

Hostelworld
was
my

trusted
resource
in

on

They
provided
me
with
a

honest

so
that

I

it's
very
simple
and
easy
to
use.

I
like
that
it
stores
my

from
certain

so
it
makes
re-ordering
even
quicker.

I
do
run
into
some

with
the

such
as
getting

but
delivery.com
has
no

from

all
I
can
say
is
that
if
you're
looking
for

-
this
is
the
place
to
shop
for
it!
Awesome
prices

I
used
Envirofone
once
before
many
years
ago
and
had
no
problems.
However,
I
cannot
say
it
is
the
same
this
time
round.
When
I
signed
up
I
requested
a
welcome
pack
with
an
envelope
for
me
to
send
my
old
phones
in.
None
arrived,
so
I
had
to
phone
up
to
order
one.
Once
my
welcome
pack
had
arrived
I
sent
my
phones
off
on
special
delivery
to
ensure
that
they
arrived
before
the
deadline.
I
then
sat
back
and
waited
for
my
cheques
to
arrive.
Eventually,
a
cheque
arrived
for
one
of
my
phones
and
it
was
not
for
the
correct
amount!
I
phoned
again
and
spoke
to
the
representative
who
informed
me
that
my
phones
had
not
arrived
in
time
and
I
would
be
offered
less.
I
told
her
that
I
had
sent
the
phones
on
special
delivery
to
arrive
a
day
before
my
deadline
and
when
she
investigated,
she
found
that
they
had
arrived
on
time.
She
said
she
would
send
another
cheque
to
me
to
make
up
the
difference,
which
I
have
now
received.
She
also
confirmed
to
me
that
because
of
damage
to
my
other
phone
they
had
to
reduce
the
offer
price,
which
I
accepted.
She
said
that
this
cheque
was
being
posted
that
day.
This
was
a
week
ago
and
I
have
not
received
this
cheque.
So,
another
phone
call
is
required
to
find
out
where
it
has
gone!
All
in
all
a
poor
service
and
I
won't
be
using
Envirofone
when
I
sell
my
next
phone.

As
a
supporter
of
Northampton
Town
Football
Club
and
a
keen
attender
to
their
home
games,
I
was
after
a
claret/maroon
undershirt
so
that
it
would
keep
me
warm
during
the
winter
months
and
allow
me
to
wear
my
replica
shirt
over
the
top
of
it.
I
had
been
looking
for
months
and
had
seen
the
Canterbury
cold
shirts
before
but
they
were
all
fairly
expensive.
That
was
until
I
found
Barrington
Sports
who
had
the
same
item
but
with
20%
off.
I
jumped
at
the
opportunity
and
ordered
one.
I
ordered
it
on
the
Tuesday
and
it
was
in
my
hands
on
the
Friday,
a
truly
brilliant
feeling
as
I
was
then
able
to
use
it
on
the
Saturday!
It
is
a
fantastic
product
and
kept
me
warm
throughout
the
match
and
is
the
perfect
colour.
Thank
you
very
very
much!!

we
wanted
in

we
wanted
and
the

within

Will

Priceline
again!!!!
B&H
pricing
almost

always
seems
to
be
lower
than
other
retailers.

I
have
never
been
disappointed.

The
quality
of
their
items
is
always
exceptional.
NetCertLabs

Yes
great
prices
but
bad
Delivery
i
needed
to
have
the
parts
in
before
Sunday.
So
that
my
michanic
could
put
them
in
before
my
Vacation
but
no
way
i
got
the
water
pump
last
and
i
did
not
get
them
together
that's
not
right.
Well
thank
you
for
the
awesome
price
but
why
should
i
get
any
more
parts
from
you
company
and
i
do
need
more
parts.
Great
online
site
for
all
types
of

Had
every
part
I
was
looking
for
(even
some
less
than
popular
ones)
and
at
prices
that
will
make
you
want
to
buy
extras.
The
shipping
was
very
fast
and
affordable.
Great
service
to
overseas.
Fine
books,
fast

and
good

experience.
Kit

A
company
you
can

!
I
made
my
first
order
and
I'll
definitely
use
them
again.

No
shipping
and
product
came
on
the
third
day
after
placing
order.

Prices
I
compared
before
the
order
were
either
lower
or
at
least
the
same.

Elsewhere
I
would
have
had
to
pay
shipping
so
yes
it
saved
me
money
using
PureFormulas.
I
trust
B&H
with
all
of
my
photographic
needs.
Being
a
lifetime
Photographer
I
always
thought
that
a
camera
strap
was
a
nuisance
so
up
until
now
I
have
carried
my
cameras
in-hand
or
in
a
bag.
Also,
with
old
age
setting
in
arthritis
will
invariably
show
up.
Bought
the
Metro
strap
and
so
far
I
am
very
happy
with
the
way
it
works.

I
have
purchased
a
number
of
warranties
through
Square
Trade
and
have
been
unfortunate
to
need
them
a
few
times.
In
each
case
the
process
was
appropriate
and
hassle
free.
Whether
it
was
an
item
that
needed
repair
or
a
total
replacement,
the
claim
process
was
straight
forward
and
met
my
every
expectation.
They
have
never
tried
to
manipulate
their
warranties
to
get
out
of
fulfilling
their
obligation
and
it
is
refreshing
to
find
a
company
that
operates
with
ethics.
Thank
you
Square

a
cheap
deal.

JamPlay
offers
lessons
for
every
ability
from
"this
is
a
guitar"
to
advanced
concepts
and
techniques.

The
lessons
are
detailed
and
progressive
and
something
is
available
for
nearly
every
genre
such
as
rock/blues,
jazz,
flamenco,
and
country.
The
building
itself
is
very
nice
(looks
nice,
and
contemporary),
but
none
of
that
matters
if
the
place
isn't
managed
well.

We
arrived
at
1AM
and
our
room
got
mixed
up
with
someone
else
(that
we
woke
up
when
we
tried
to
get
into
the
room),
when
we
let
the
front
desk
know
they
immediately
called
the
people
in
the
room
waking
them
up
again...

They
got
it
straightened
out
and
gave
us
coupons
for
a
"free"
breakfast
-
turns
out
if
you
get
anything
hot
at
breakfast
that's
an
extra
fee
($11/person!)
so
we
still
had
to
pay
for
it.

it

fast
and
I
am
happy
with
my
purchase
Pen

arrived
in
a
relatively
short
period
and
were
exactly
as
described.
My
only
criticism
is
the
postage
of
£10.00
-
which
certainly
got
the
order
to
me
quickly
but
I
would
not
have
been
perturbed
if
the
postal
charge
was
around
£4.00
and
the
goods
arrived
a
week
or
two
later.
Perhaps
alternatives
on
postage
costs
cpould
be
put
to
customers
when
ordering
I
loved
using
Oak
Furniture
Land.
Easy
to
order,
fully

lovely

The

Whats
not
to

It
was
an

a

and
the

Everything
was
excellent,
and
will
definitely
use
it
again.
Everything
worked
fine
on

the

asking
for
confirmation
that
the

were
ready
on
the
day
before
they
were
suppsed
to
be
shipped
was
confusin
-
otherwise,
well
done.
I
like
the
variety
of
products
they
carry.

They
delivered
very
quickly
and
their
website
is
easy
to
navigate.
Great
save
for
only
a
few

Covered
my
wife's
bumper
that
was
chipped
and
scratch
on
her
Avalon
due
to
lifting
weights
in
and
out
of
trunk.

Car
looked
new
except
the
top
of
the
rear
bumper,
it
looks
new
again.
i
received
an
item
that
was
substituted
for
the
one
ordered,

this
item
would
not
work
and
had
to
return
it
for
the
right
one.

i
had
to
pay
the
shipping
for
sending
the
order
back
even
though
it
was
partgeeks
mistake.
i
FOUND
THE
SERVICE
AS
PROMISED
AND
THE
PRICES
MODERATE
You
should
have
a
look
at
the
rates
on
Red
Spot
Car
Rentals

If
they
have
what
you
want
and
they
did
for
me
the
rates
are
quite
good
for
the
car
you
get.

The
pick
up
and
drop
off
had
no
dramas.

I
booked
on
line
so
dont
know
how
you
would
go
if
you
just
fronted
up
at
the
airport.
Read
the
reviews
and
wasn't
sure
so
I
booked
the
time
an
hour
earlier
than
check
in
just
in
case
they
were
not
there,
but

I
shouldn't
have
worried.
They
were
they
waiving
at
me
as
i
turned
the
corner
and
on
the
return
were
waiting
for
me
with
my
car
even
before
I
had

phoned
them.
Everything
went
fine
except
having
to
lay
out
the
£1000
deposit.
We
should
have
been
told
about
this
beforehand.
Love
you

It's
a

Don't

I
can
only
comment
on
my
personal
experience:
I
purchased
a
pair
of
tickets
(for
my
girlfriend
and
her
best
friend)
to
go
and
see
'Donny
and
Marie
Osmond'
at
the
O2
arena
on
the
opening
night
of

their
tour.
An
example
of
what
other
companies
should
be!
I
always
get
my
orders
in
less
than
30
minutes,
very
secure
and
trustworthy!

The
floormats
I
ordered
do
not
fit
even
a
little
bit!!!
They
were
listed
as
fitting
a
2004
Infiniti
G35
Coupe.
When
we
tried
to
put
them
in
the
car
they
would
not
fit
without
hitting
the
rails
where
the
seat
slides
back
and
forth.
Thus
we
were
not
able
to
adjust
the
seat
to
the
proper
location
we
need
to
drive
car.
We
would
have
to
have
the
seat
all
the
way
in
the
back
position.
That
would
make
it
impossible
to
to
push
the
clutch
pedal
all
the
way
in
to
get
the
car
in
gear.
We
read
the
return
directions
sent
with
the
floormats
and
would
have
to
pay
for
return
shipping
and
restocking
fee!!!!!!!!!!!
As
the
mats
seem
to
be
fairly
heavy
it
does
not
make
sence
to
pay
for
return
shipping
and
restocking
fee
as
this
was
not
our
fault
that
the
do
not
fit
the
model
car
they
were
purchased
for
So
I
guess
we
will
just
have
to
EAT
THE
$68.00
WE
PAID
FOR
THEM!!!!!!!
We
Will
Not
Be
Doing
Bussiness
With
Parts
Geek
Again!
Other
Buyers
Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!

The

The

was

Even

took
under
10

and
I

Awesome!
BH
Photo
is
the
ONLY
store
in
the
entire
country
that
I
will
trust
for
my
camera
supplies,
they
have
everything
I
need
in
stock,
they
have
a
great
staff
on
hand
to
answer
every
question...
I
keep
coming
back
again
and
again
I
use
this
site
all
the
time
to
find
the
cheapest
fares.
They
also
send
me
emails
for
special
deals.
Very
good
WEB
Site
,
you
can
find
hints
and
wizards
to
get
the
type
of
certificate
you
need.
Once
you
start
buying
a
certificate
at
trustico
you
get
it
in
just
a
few
minutes!
i;m
sorry
I
cant
t
give
you
a
5
star
rating,
but
you
made
a
mistake.
This
was
a
good
deal.
Their
price
was
right
and
the
product
was
excellent,
a
perfect
match
for
the
original
screen.
Thanks
to
the
how-to
videos
(2),
I
was
able
to
walk
through
the
entire
replacement
procedure
on
my
crippled
machine
before
I
even
ordered
the
thing.

When
the
part
arrived,
It
took
me
about
a
whopping
10
minutes
for
the
entire
job,
from
removing
the
bezel
to
booting
up
and
wiping
my
finger
prints
off
the
new
screen.

Total
cost
about
$75
with
FedEx
shipping.
I
got
my
product
very
quickly.

However,
it
did
not
fit
the
vehicle
that
they
said
it
would
and
the
correct
part
was
not
available.

They
will
refund
purchase
price
but
not
the
shipping
cost
to
me
or
the
cost
for
me
to
return
it.

If
this
was
my
mistake
I
would
expect
to
pay
the
shipping,
but
it
wasn't.

It
was
advertised
incorrectly
and
they
will
not
pay
for
their
mistake.

That
is
poor
business
ethics.

I
will
NEVER
do
business
with
them
again.

This
policy
is
stated
on
their
website,
unfortunately
I
didn't
think
it
would
apply
if
it
was
their
mistake.

I
guess
that
is
my
bad.

Buyer
beware.

Next
time
I
will
buy
from
Summit.

They
did
offer
free
shipping
on
my
next
order,
however
there
will
be
no
next
order.
I
send
around
20
parcels
a
day.
I
have
used
them
only
once
and
it
was
a
good
experience
.
I
only
used
them
once
as
a
had
a
discount
code
otherwise
they
would
be
too
expensive.
BIG
MAJOR
FLAW:
you
cannot
get
a
quote
unless
you
have
already
sold
the
product
as
the
site
requires
a
postcode.
Ok
let's
say
I
want
to
sell
some
stuff
in
Australia
and
need
to
say
the
postage
costs,
well
parcel
hero
cannot
give
you
a
quote;
therefore
it'
s
easier
to
use
other
sites
for
selling.so
to
sum
up
apart
from
being
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
and
not
able
to
provide
quotes
it
is
a
good
site.
I'm
in
no
rush
to
use
again
though.
No
problems
all
worked
well
just
takes
a
little
longer
to
use
than
say
parcel2go.
Site
just
needs
to
be
slightly
more
simplified
.
The
email
to
inform
you
the
parcel
has
been
delivered
is
great
Always
reliable
with
great
prices,
the
online
help
makes
it
easy
to
find
the
correct
cables
etc.
I
had
only
one
bad
experience
with
Global
and
that
was
in
Washington
State.

The
motel
lost
my
truck
keys
and
would
not
reimburse
me
for
the
expense
of
getting
home
and
back
and
having
a
locksmith
reprogram
my
truck.

I
have
used
you
at
other
times
and
been
very
satisfied.

I
will
never
again
park
at
a
hotel/motel.


Your
lots
are
great.
Bought
an
over

U

Did
I

I
ordered

Jack
Wolfskin
jacket

it
was

I

So
the
transaction
online
was
very
simple
and
was
the
best
price.

I'm
generally
the
person
that
feels
you
get
what
you
pay
for,
but
I
took
a
crap
shoot
hoping
all
would
go
well.

Firstly,
priceline
booked
my
room
through
their
'sister'
company,
booking.com.

While
I
normally
would
not
care
if
everyone
was
peachy,
it
matters
now
when
you
have
a
problem.
This
product
integrates
perfectly
with
our
online
store.

It
is
very
easy
to
use
and
runs
without
manual
intervention
from
our
staff.

Mailbeez
has
put
a
lot
of
attention
into
the
inner
workings
of
this
product
and
it
shows
in
the
polished
layout
and
easy
operation.

Our
favorite
feature
is
the
ability
to
send
automated
marketing
emails
to
our
new,
recent,
and
past
customers
without
touching
anything.

So
far,
from
2
weeks
of
use
we
have
noticed
an
increase
in
product
reviews
and
conversions.

Support
from
mailbeez
is
top
notch
and
quick
to
respond!
I've
worked
with
Mike
on
many
projects
for
implementing
features
on
the
DRIS
website
for
years
and
I
have
to
say,
Mike
and
his
staff
are
top
notch!

They
definitely
know
the
scuba
industry
and
can
answer
just
about
any
question
thrown
at
them.
They
advertise
buyer
protection,
but
they
do
not
provide
it.
Ultimately
they
are
the
judge
and
jury,
so
be
forewarned
that
buyer
protection
does
not
exist,
I
found
out
the
hard
way.
They
have
great
prices,
I
got
just
a
goofy
good
deal
on
my
Whites
Fusion
during
their
black
friday
special.
Mike
was
always
there
to
answer
my
questions,
and
the
work
they
did
on
the
suit
(replaceable
neck
and
wrist
seals)
was
first
rate.
I
was
very
satisfied
with
the
service
I
received.
Was
able
to
track
shipment
right
away
and
it
came
right
on
time.
items
that
were
brought
were
good,
the
only
problem
was,
no
instructions,
as
you
can
get
the
legs
mixed
up
on
assembly,
the
other
problem
was
it
seems
to
have
sat
around
awhile
as
was
full
of
dust
and
friction
marks
on
the
legs
in
transit
[packaging]
there
was
also
a
small
tear
on
the
underside

if
i
had
paid
full
price
for
this
i
would
not
be
amused,
but
it
was
soon
cleaned
up
and
im
happy,
think
someone
should
check
and
be
responsible
for
the
goods
before
they
leave,
but
hey
im
not
the
boss.
My
order
was
received
on
time
and
the
price
was
correct.
That's
all
I
ask.
Arrived
as
promised.
Priced
competitively.
I
did
not
think
I
could
get
as
good
service
from
an
on-line
provider
as
I
get
from
the
local
T-Shirt
Print
Shop;
I
was
wrong.

The
website
was
"wicked"
easy
and
there
was
a
person
to
live
chat
with
to
get
me
through
the
process
and
make
sure
I
picked
out
the
right
colors.

Never
have
been
sure
about
ordering
something
as
substantial
as
a
new
computer
online
as
I
was
rather
worried
that
something
would
go
wrong
or
there
would
be
some
other
kind
of
problem
that
would
cause
stress.
I
took
the
plunge
and
glad
I
did!
I
found
the
selection
and
configuration
process
on
Dino
PC's
website
very
easy
to
follow
including
the
ordering
and
payment
process.
My
computer
arrived
from
Dino
PC
within
the
estimated
delivery
date
and
packed
as
stated
on
the
website.
Setting
up
of
my
new
computer
was
extremely
easy
and
took
hardly
any
time
or
effort
;
the
only
time
taken
was
the
usual
software
updates
required
for
Windows.
I
was
also
extremely
happy
that
there
was
no
pre-loaded
junk/software
on
the
computer,
no
'trial'
software
or
programs
either
like
you
normally
get
from
a
shop
bought
computer
and
to
cap
it
all
the
final
price
was
much
cheaper
than
a
comparitive
computer
from
one
of
the
usual
high
street
pc
retailers.
Overall
I
was,
and
still
am,
very
impressed
and
extremely
satisfied!
Thankyou
Dino
PC!
Great
prices
and
a
very
large
selection
of

could

the

I
have
just
booked
a
parking
spot
with
SKYPARK
for
my
next
holiday
abroad.
I
am
afraid
that
this
review
will
be
very
boring
because
there
were
no
problems
with
the
booking,
no
frightening
prices
to
make
me
anxious,
nothing
I
didn't
understand.
I
have
been
a
customer
of
Doheny's
for
several
years
and
I
have
always
had
the
same
result
with
every
order.
That
is,
swift
and
accurate
service
with
a
quality
product.
Delivery
was
fast
and
the
products
as
shiw
in
web
site
Thanks
team,
you
will
hear
a
lot
more
from
me
:)
I
can't
rate
Cult
Pens
highly
enough.
A
few
clicks
and
my
purchase
was
complete.
Smooth
process
and
everything
works
as
expected
Fantastic
customer
service.
They
found
me
the
exact
space
and
location
that
I
was
looking
for.
Good
products,
arrived
promptly.
A++
Paid
up
front,
no
hidden
charges
when
I
arrived
at
destination.
Alamo
were
pretty
rubbish,
booked
a
car
months
in
advance
at
a
specific
time
to
arrive
and
be
told
that
they
didnt
have
the
car
I
booked.
Stood
waiting
for
over
an
hour.
Finally
got
a
car,
but
it
was
dirty.
However,
the
return
of
the
car
was
amazing.
Drive
in,
park
up,
remove
your
luggage,
someone
gives
it
the
once
over
and
you
get
a
ticket
to
say
everything
is
ok.
2
minutes!
Cant
fault
rentalcars.com
though.
Would
book
with
them,
but
would
be
tempted
away
from
Alamo.
When
you
get
to
your
car
hire
place,
there
will
be
extra
charges.
Everything
should
be
specified
on
the
website.
I
used
rentalcars.com
previously,
they
were
much
better.
No
hidden
charges,
paid
up
front,
arrived,
picked
keys
up
and
left
(brand
new
motor).
VIPcars
gave
me
a
quote,
I
booked
it,
but
when
I
arrived
to
pick
up
car,
the
extra
charges
meant
the
car
was
double
the
quote.
Not
a
great
car
either.
Not
sure
,
have
bought
from
before,
but
this
time
think
part
was
old.

I
was
a
little
bit
hesitant
to
order
from
Ties.com
for
fear
of
bad
quality
with
the
low
prices,
but
am
so
glad
to
see
that
the
quality
is
great!!
Thank
you
so
much
for
providing
an

and
quality

:)
Got
what
others
wanted
to
much
for
and
it
was
delivered
on
time.
I
asked
question
per
e-mail
and
was
answered
courteously
and
professionally.
You
can't
ask
for
more
than
that.
Product
was
as
told.The
confusion
was
on
the
items
company
mergers
that
had
me
confused.
But
all
was
explained
save
big
on
price.
The
plaques
came
out
perfect.

we
are
excited
to
get
them
up
at
the
school
for
everyone
to
enjoy.
I
highly
recommend
Plaquemaker.

My
order
was
handled
quickly
and
the
final
product
was
sturdy
and
attractive.

I
found
the
prices
very
reasonable.
I
haven't
used
black
circles
before
but
found
the
process
fast
and
efficient,
the
only
blip
in
the
purchase
was
the
requirement
to
upload
my
driving
licence
when
I
wanted
to
spread
the
payments
over
12
months,
and
despite
my
best
efforts
my
licence
verification
was
rejected...but
was
accepted
the
next
day.
Happy
with
the
process
and
it
was
very
convenient
with
the
garage
less
than
500
yards
from
my
doorstep.
I
buy
a
premium
dog
food
and
I
watch
the
price
closely,
keep
the
price
competitive.
Your
service
will
keep
me
coming
back.
I
have
made
several
bookings
with
Parcel2Go
on

of
the

I
work
for.
There
was
a
slight
delay
in

the

spoke
to
Emma
who
was
very
helpful
and
polite.
She
got
me
a
copy
emailed
across
instantly
without
any
fuss
or
drama.
I'm
sure
to
continue
using
them
for
future
orders.
Arrived
quickly
and
very
well
packaged.

Thanks.

Already

We

They
did
a
wonderful
job
the
only
reason
I
am
giving
them
4
stars
instead
of
5
was
because
they
kept
addressing
me
with
my
predecessor
name
instead
of
mine.
Even
though
I
had
my
name
clear
as
day
in
my
email
responds.
Other
than
that
they
did
an
excellent
job!
Was
very
fast
quick
simple
and
easy,
Love
them
:D
You
did
what
you
said
that
you
would
do
when
you
said
that
you
would
do
it
-
thanks!
Everything
was
ordered
perfect
and
in
great
shape.
Also
the
delivery
came
in
3
and
5
days
instead
of
7
to
10
days.
Everything
was
ordered
correctly
and
the
web
site
made
it
clear
on
which
part
fit
which
model
car.
One
thing
though.
I
ordered
left
and
right
brake
sensors
.
They
are
different
and
the
package
did
not
say
which
one
was
left
or
right.
I
figured
it
out
because
one
only
fit
one
location
but
labeling
left
or
right
would
of
be
nice
as
to
know
for
sure.
Other
than
that
all
was
great.
Thank
you.

I

SIN
DUDAS
MUY
RECOMENDABLE
By
far
my
favourite
place
to
go
for
e-liquids,
would
recommend
to
all.

I
mostly
use
the
VG
based
XO
(own
brand)
liquids
but
I
have
recommended
the
site
to
friend's
who
use
the
other
brands.
I've
purchased
a
number
of
different
products
from
JW
Supps
and
they
haven't
let
me
down
once;
be
it
the
quality
of
the
product,
the
prices
they
offer
or
just
the
description
of
products
unfamiliar
to
me
-
they've
not
missed
the
mark
once.

Oh,
and
delivery
is
very
fast
on
UK
orders.

Happy
to
recommend
to
all.

Cheers
Until
these
guys
do
something
horribly
wrong
I
will
continue
to
use
and
recommend
them
and
their
products
to
all
considering
dipping
their
toes
into
the
world
of
sports
supplements.

There
are
so
many
'brands'
wanting
to
trick
you
into
paying
whey
(pun
intended)
over
the
top
for
your
protein
or
amino's
and
it
makes
my
eyes
roll
when
I
hear
kids
in
my
gym
talking
about
how
good
their
£60
(1.9kg)
tub
of
protein
is
better
than
theirs...
it's
not.

My
Protein's
protein
is
better
than
all
with
a
good
selection
of
different
blends
and
a
price
beating
unlfavoured
basic
range
(£45.00ish
for
5kg
of
90%
WPI
protein?

Unbeatable!).

You
can
use
them
with
confidence
and
they
have
a
good
customer
service
dept.
to
boot.

No
I
don't
work
for
them
but
I
certainly
buy
from
them,
hope
this
little
review
helps?
They
were
fast
in
finding
a
good
priced
flight.
They
called
back
at
a
convenient
time
for
us
to
make
the
payment.
All
my
contact
with
Go-Electrical
was
exemplary.
From
the
time
of
placing
the
order
to
delivery
was
3
working
days
and
at
each
stage
I
received
an
informative
email.
Can't
fault
them,
would
certainly
look
to
use
them
again.
Nothing
really
to
add,
my
order
was
correct,
came
promptly
and
was
in
good
order.
Keep
it
up!
I

Great
prices,
fast
shipping!
-
I'm
hooked!!
The
part
I
ordered
was
shipped
to
me
very
quickly.
The
quality,
fit,
and
pricing
was
excellent.
Couldn't
beat
it
anywhere
else!!!
When
I
see
multiple
add-on
fees
to
an
order,
I
make
an
extra
effort
to
find
the
same
products
on
other
websites.

There
were
three
different
fees
added
to
my
last
order,
one
of
which
was
"mailing"
when
the
order
was
being
shipped
by
a
different
carrier.
I
bought
the
unlock
code
for
my
at&t
Galaxy
S2
at
aroung
midnight
and
it
was
in
my
email
within
2
minutes.

It
did
exactly
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
and
now
I
can
use
it
on
the
t-mobile
network
as
well
as
any
other
GSM
network.

It
was
easy
and
I
didn't
even
have
to
call
costumer
service
for
help.
And
the
web
site
could
have
parts
out
of
stock
and
u
wont
know
until
they
charge
u
for
them
and
then
they
say
something
was
wrong
with
your
shipping
.
which
is
not
true.then
they
take
forever
to
return
ur
money.
As
above,
I
got
what
I
ordered
so

Great
company
to

I
chose

down
VA
Loan
and
they
did
a
fantastic
job
from
start
to
finish.

My
loan
officer,
Daniel
Heggarty,
walked
us
through
the
process
from
pre-qualification,
approval
to
closing.

They
helped
me
find
an
agent
and
made
sure
the
process
was
kept
moving
along.

When
we
started
having
delays
with
the
listing
agent,
he
got
on
it
with
both
the
listing
and
our
agent
to
get
things
done.

We
even
got
a
check
back
from
VU
for
using
the
agent
they
recommended
and
we
got
money
back
at
closing
too.

I
really
couldn't
have
asked
for
anything
more.

We
love
our
new
house!
I
needed
and
ordered
an
external
shower
valve
and
decided
to
add
a
shower
riser
and
shower
head
to
the
order,

It
became
a
"bundled"
order.

I
am
satisfied
with
the
valve
but
the
riser
and
shower
head
did
not
work
with
the
configuration
of
my
existing
system.

In
trying
to
return
these
parts
I
was
declined
as
it
was
considered
a
bundle
and
would
have
to
return
the
entire
order
to
receive
a
refund
-
the
valve
already
installed
made
this
impossible.

Very
rigid
in
their
approach.

Either
ensure
your
do
not
have
bundled
orders
or
do
not
order

And
one
of
those
was
a
Bankholiday.
I
bought
a
PSN
$20
card.
They
sent
the
info
after
just
a
couple
of
minutes
to
my
email.
Using
Paypal
is
nice
and
the
processing
fee
is
one
of
the
lowest
I've

The

is
very

on
my
next
move

I
purchase
a
fair
amount
of
goods
online,
but
when
I
want
to
purchase
expensive
camera
equipment
I
will
always
go
through
B&H.
They
ship
their
merchandise
out
quickly
and
in
safe
packaging,
their
pricing
is
always
competitive,
and
they
will
most
like
have
the
product
you
are
looking
for.
Kept
seeing
a
lot
of
targeted
ads
on
Facebook
and
Google
so
I
checked
out
the
site
and
after
I
had
moved
house
I
put
in
my
first
order
which
consisted
of
6
Protein
Ready
Meals
(had
eaten
1
so
far
and
it
was
very
yummy)
and
the
£75
Starter
pack
which
contains
so
much
meat
its
insane.
People's
faces
when
I
say
it
includes
5kg
of
chicken
breasts
is
worth
the
purchase
alone!
ive
just
bought
an
iLok
from
GAK
and
I
have
to
say
that
I
am
impressed
with
the
speed
and
efficiency
of
delivery
and
after
doing
a
bit
of
research
and
comparisons
I
found
GAK
sold
the
same
product
cheaper
than
anywhere
else
I
had
seen.
Great
job
and
response.
The
pictures
on
the
labels
came
out
perfect
and
the
order
came
much
faster
than
expected.
I
was
able
get
all
the
information
I
needed
and
was
able
to
reserve
the
storage
unit.

This
was
all
done
after
the
business's
regular
hours.

The
person
I
spoke
was
very
friendly
and
helpful.

I
will
definately
use
them
again.
Super
easy
to
use
and
so
many
great
listings
-
definitely
my
go
to
from
now
on!
Signing
up
with
livewatch
was
a
breeze.

The
customer
service
person
was
extremely
nice
and
helpful.

I
ordered
the
hardware
and
it
arrived
in
a
few
days.
It
took
only
a
few
hours
to
get
everything
installed
and
tested.
On
my
startup
day
the
rep
called
me
promptly
and
we
were
activated
in
a
few
minutes.

I
had
one
false
alarm
with
my
garage
door
and
I
was
promptly
called
by
the
service.

Also
got
a
text
as
well
as
the
people
on
my
ASAP
list.

It
all
works
perfectly
just
like
you
would
expect
for
a
whole
lot
less
money
than
you
would
pay
one
of
the
"Big
Three"
monitoring
companies.

I
am
completely
satisfied
and
I
know
you
will
be
as
well.
Great
quality
products.

No
games
or
hassles.
Choose
the
products
you
want
from
a
well
designed
website
and
get
them
shipped
to
you
within
a
very
short
time.
You
cant
beat
that!
Love
this
website.

Reliable,
great
customer
service,
and
excellent
variety
of
vendors.

I
would
recommend
Delivery
to
anyone...
Plus
there's
a
sweet
rewards
system
that
gets
you
lots
of
prizes
once
you
place
a
certain
number
of
orders.

Win-win!
Very
impressed
with
the
price
of
100
AAA's.
Cannot
fault
them
as
a
supplier.
Great
product,
quick
delivery
and
they
have
every
magnet
you
can
think
of!!
Will
use
them
again.
I
was
sceptical
when
i
first
was
at
the
site,
but
after
my
first
order
went
that
smooth
(and
reading
other
reviews)
i
bought
my

Needed
a

for
my
2009
car
-
and
only
the
dealer
sold
them,
according
to
my
independent
garage.
$650.
including
labor!

I
found
PartsGeek
online,

and
bought
a
remanufactured
one,
and
it
was
shipped
quickly.

The

installed
price
with
labor
was
about
a
third
of
what
the
new
starter
would've
cost
me.

I've
used
remanufactured
parts
before,
and
had
good
luck
with
them.

Ask
me
again
in
a
year
or
two's
time
as
to
how
this
one
is
holding
up.
But
as
of
now,
I'm
a
happy
camper,
and
would
consider
using
this
company
again.
I
needed
buttons
for
an

so
I
contacted
Affordable
Buttons.

Since
I
knew
nothing
about
the
process,
they
explained
exactly
what
I
needed
to
do.

I
had
our
designers
create
the
button
layout
based
on
their
instructions
then
Affordable
Buttons
did
the
final
touch-up.

They
arrived
before
the
promised
date
and
were
perfect.

Afforable
Buttons
were
very
helpful
and
knowledgable.

The
buttons
were
a
hit
at
the
event.
Great
experience.
I'd
buy
again.

Ordered
on
line,
called
to
check
on
parts
the
day
they
were
to
arrive
only
to
find
out
they
did
not
ship.
They
were
waiting
for
me
to
call
and
confirm
the
order.
Why
would
i
bother
to
order
on

if
you
have
to
call
to
finish
the

Told
them
to
cancel
and
i

I've
dealt
with

for
years.
They're

While

online
I
found
a
site
that's
like
the
Kayak
of

It
was
very
straightforward
to
find
all
the
options
I
needed
in
a
unit,
and
the
online
deal
I
found
is
saving
me
about
$30
a
month
on
my
5x10.
They
got
back
to
me
very
quickly
and
offered
me
more
money
than
the
other

at

I
just

But
in
the
winter
I
have
faced
a
problem,
I
needed
to
buy
warm
boots
with
fur
as
in
the
winter
in
Russia
it
is
cold,
every
winter
there
are
frosts
to
a
minus
of
26
degrees
on

and
in
boots
without

is
cold.
In

boots
with

did
not
sell,
is
the
most
exact
1или
than

which
to

Over
the
years
I
have
ordered
several
Safilo

frames
because
the
quality
is
absolutely
first

I
ordered
my
latest
frames
from
AFEyewear.com
because
I
could
not
find
them
locally.
After
ordering
them
I
was
notified
that
they
were
on
backorder.
I
was
given
an
opportunity
to
either
cancel
my
order
or
to
continue
the
backorder.
Those
frames
are
worth
waiting
for
&
I
know
that
backorders
generally
are
not
the
fault
of
the

so
I
chose
to
wait.
The

I
do
a
considerable
amount
of
hobby
trading
on
eBay.

I
found
an
item
I
wanted
to
build
and
present
to
a
physician
friend
who
has
provided
me
with
competent
and
compassionate
healthcare
over
the
past
decade,
but
found
the
eBay
price
and
S&H
to
be
unrealistic
for
a
new
but
relatively
common
product.

I
decided
to
research
the
product
on
HobbyLinc,
just
to
see
if
my
theory
of
price
gouging
held
true.

Even
having
to
pay
GA
sales
tax,
the
HobbyLink
price
was
well
below
HALF
of
the
asking
price
with
S&H
charges
for
the
identical
item
on
eBay.
I
wanted
to
get
a
stethoscope
for
my
fiancée,
and
they
helped
me
with
not
only
the
purchase
and
engraving
of
the
stethoscope,
but
also
finding
a
nice
physician
bag
to
keep
that
and
some
other
stuff
in.
Spoke
with
them
on
the
phone
three
times,
and
they
were
excellent
with
their
help!
Shipped
fast,
and
couldn't
have
been
happier
with
them!
I
can

but
I
did
a
little
searching
on
Ebay
and
found
Ingram's.
After
checking
them
out-
researching
their
location
and
reading
reviews-
I
placed
an
order.
The
price
was
great
and
they
tossed
in
a
10kW

strip
for
free!

This

is
a
quick
and
easy
study
combined
with
really
great
customer
service.

My
only
small
point
of
contention
is
that
because
I
pay
with
a
credit
card,
the
materials
I
order
have
to
be
shipped
to
my
home,
as
opposed
to
my

where
I
spend
a
zillion
hours
a

All
things
being
equal,
great
job!!
Ok,
so
I
have
been
struggling
with
losing
and
managing
my
weight
as
well
as
staying
healthy.
I
swear
I
have
so
many
physical
and
health
problems
from
my
surgeries
in
the
past
I
just
felt
that
I
would
never
stay
as
fit
and
healthy
as
I
wanted
to.
However
when
one
of
my
family
members
had
this
"heavy
duty
shaker
bottle"
from
this
place
called
supplement
warehouse
I
immediately
questioned
her
on
where
she
purchased
that
awesome
looking
bottle.
Once
she
told
me
about
the
site,
the
rest
was
history.
See
I
was
purchasing
meal
replacements
from
other
places
but
the
prices
for
all
foods
and
organic
items
are
crazy
sky
high,
but
unfortunately
I
kept
paying
for
the
meal
replacements
that
I
wanted
because
I
couldn't
find
any
place
else
that
was
selling
it.
Well,
not
only
does
this
sight
sell
what
most
stores
don't,
it
compares
prices
to
other
competitors.
I
was
literally
able
to
find
an
item
on
another
site,
post
the
URL
in
the
item
I
wanted
from
Supplement
Warehouse
and
I
got
it
for
cheaper
on
this
sight.
No
other
sight
compares
to
this
honestly,
and
so
I
will
keep
investing
with
this
company.

of
virtually
everything
I
have
ever
purchased
from
MCM
over
the
last
20
or

years!

On
the
few
occasions
when
something
arrived
inoperable,
MCM
has
been
most
righteous
in
correcting
the
problem
or
replacing
the
unit,
hassle-free.

Their
shipping
is
as
fast
and
expedient
as
anyone
I
have
ever
done
business
with
online.

Even
when
I
have
orders
shipped
to
other
places
around
the
country,
they
are
received
quickly.

On
of
my
most
recent
purchases,
an
amplified
HDTV
antenna
and
amplified
speakers
were
the
same
exceptional
values
I've
come
to
expect
from
MCM.

Saturday
in
AZ,
they
then
got
picked
up
on
Monday
and
they
didn't
arrive
in
MA
till
Monday
the
following
week.

Not
having
your
clubs
for
2
weekends
is
really
not
a
workable
solution.
Basically
went
onto
the
web
site
..
Entered
reg
number
,
selected
tyres
,
selected
local
garage
and
saved
about
£30
against
going
into
the
garage
myself!!!

No
brainer
..
Great
price
and
easy
to
use...delivered
within
48
hours
of
me
ordering...once
I
ordered
I
realised
I
ordered
the
wrong
strength
..this
wasn't
an
issue
I
was
advised
just
to
send
them
back
as
long
as
they
weren't
open
and
they
would
replace!!
I
have
purchased
tires
for
4
vehicles
at
this
store
location.
I
have
worked
with
different
sales
associates
and
always
treated
professional.
I
would
recommend
to
see
anyone
of
them.
They
stand
by
there
work.
I
have
yet
receive
my
purchase
because
I
am
not
at
home
during
the
day
when
FedEx
attempts
delivery.
I
was
not
aware
when
I
made
the
purchase
that
I
would
be
required
to
sign
for
the
equipment.
Supposedly
this
is
a
feature
orchestrated
by
the
sender
(Test
Equipment
Depot).
FedEx
will
not
leave
at
my
home
without
signature.
Nor
can
I
get
them
to
leave
at
FedEx
hub
where
I
could
go
by
and
pick
it
up.
Very
frustrated
about
the
shipping
experience.
Don't
know
when
I
will
get
the
equipment
I
ordered.
Meine
Umbuchung
wurde
trotz
mehrfachen
Anrufens
nicht
durchgeführt.
letztlich
habe
ich
selbst
im
Hotel
angerufen.
werde
nie
mehr
mit
HRS
buchen.
The
part
I
received
was
not
the
part
in
the
picture,
What
a
waist
of
money!!!!!!
The
goods
were
as
decribed
and
delivered
quickly
with
good
packaging.
I
ordered
my
Hartke
115c
Bass
Combo
online
from
GAK,
paid
the
cash,
crossed
my
fingers
and
held
my
breath...


It's
a
BIG
box
-
and
a
LONG
way
from
Brighton
to
Barrow
in
Furness!!!
I
was
even
naive
enough
to
request
delivery
before
12
noon.
I
was
a
bit
leary
when
I
first
saw
the
out
dated
discounted
prices
on
certain
supplements.
But
all
there
products
are
great.
And,
the
products
which
are
not
discounted
for
quick
sale
are
still
well
below
competitor's
prices.
Products
arrive
on
time
and
that
is
a
key
issue
when
you
need
to
stay
"on
cycle".
Optimum
Nutrition
Food
was
well
priced
and
it
arrived
before
the
promised
delivery
date.
Was
a
bit
skeptical
about
using
this
company,
but
ps4
deal
seemed
too
good
to
miss.
Ordered
a
few
things
from
them
and
no
issues
whatsoever,
always
delivered
on
time.
Been
using
cloud
9
for
a
while.
Really
like
this
company
and
the
others
they
have
under
their
belt.
Brilliant
online
pharmaceutical
and
so
far
the
best
I
have
used.
Promised
I
would
not
buy
from
them
again
after
the
shambles
I
experienced
with
support
over
a
pressure
washer
(no
tracking
info,
developed
fault
within
2
weeks,
long
wait
times
on
phone).
Have
used
Liberro
a
few
times
and
they
have
become
one
of
my
favourite
e-cig
companies
to
deal
with.
I
have
used
Qvc
a
couple
of
times
and
always
found
them
to
be
first
class.
Items
are
of
always
good
build
quality
and
also
I
have
always
received
the
orders
"next
working
day".
It
has
a
large
variety
of
clothing
and
accessories
that
everyone
can
like
and
enjoy.
There
is
also
no
tax
sales
so
the
prices
are
cheaper,
not
to
mention
that
the
clothing
already
is
at
a
low
price.
Needed
to
replace
the
trunk
lid
struts
on
our
2002
Saab
9-3
SE.

I
ordered
the
wrong
part
number
so
I
returned
those
and
after
assistance
from
PartsGeek,
I
ordered
the
correct
struts.

They
are
to
arrive
this
Tuesday.

So
far,
so
good!!!
purchase
from
B&H
for
all
my
customers
need.
Excellent
price
and
fast
shipping.
Excellent
price
and
service!!
Recommended
Found
the
part
I
needed
on
their
site
and
ordered
it.

Receive
it
and
was
exactly
as
described.
If
FedEx
tracking
is
accurate
delivery
time
will
be
two
weeks.
This
is
unacceptable
for
an
item
that
was
available
from
one
of
your
warehouses
no
matter
what
the
delivery
charge.
Customers
should
be
advised
that
delivery
could
take
that
long
knowing
that
the
item
will
ship
from
a
distant
warehouse.
But
then
if
I
had
known
that
I
wouldn't
have
placed
the
order.
As
it
is
Parts
Geek
will
not
be
the
first
store
that
I
will
shop
for
parts
in
the
future.
I
have
compared
fees
for
a
flight
to
Bombay
(amazingly
enough,
it
would
have
been
quite
cheaper
not
to
leave
from
Zurich
but
from
Geneva,
even
though
Geneva-Zurich,
return,
means
an
additional
flight...
but
this
is
another
topic)
and
found
out
that
booking
with
Ebookers
was
the
best
bargain
and
it
worked
out
very
quickly
and
efficiently.
Everything
is
easy
to
find
and
even
when
I
had
to
call
for
advice
on
a
specific
piece
of
equipment,
I
received
exceptional
customer
service.
This
is
the
place
to
get
whatever
you
need
electronics
and
the
prices
are
down
to
earth,
you
won't
go
broke
and
delivery
is
fast.
i
made
a
rservation
and
realized

i
could
not
arrive
as
planned.

It
was
a
non-cancellabe,
no
refund
request,

I
called
Expedia,
and
they
called
the
hotel
who
agreed
to
waive
the
obligation.
I
would
recommend
the
mobile
fitting
service
to
anyone!
I
use
B&H

because
it

a

The
Logo
Company
provides
an
excellent
logo
design
service.
I
was
shown
logo
concepts
from
five
different
designers.
Every
logo
design
was
very
professional,
original
and
creative.
I
choose
one
logo
concept
and
after
a
few
minor
changes
I
had
the
perfect
logo
for
my
business.
My
part
came
in
two
days.
It
was
a
perfect
fit.
The
shipping
was
fast
and
the
part
worked
perfectly.
I
saved
myself
about
$300.00
by
using

Really
happy.
Great
products
arrived
in
a
timely
manner.The
international
delivery
took
3
days
longer
then
stated
on
the
site,
however
I
felt
the
proposed
date
was
a
bit
ambitious
at
the
time.
Overall
very
happy.
The
items
you
sell
are
of
the
best
quality.
I
don't
know
how
you
sell
the
items
for
such
low

with
such
excellent

I

i
had
a
question
regarding
my
shipment,
and
my
answer
was
very
satisfying.
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
my

It

Ordered
my
Stagg

Friday
evening
and
it
came
the
following
Tuesday
as

I've
made
3
orders
through
eEuroparts
so
far,
they
have
beat
anyone's
prices,
and
the
free
shipping
was
very
fast.
I've
called
once
with
questions
and
the
service
representative
(Zak)
was
very
helpful
and
knowledgeable.
I'll
be
using
them
for
all
my
SAAB
parts
from
now
on.
Never
had
anything
but
great
service
and
fast
delivery
from
Merlin.
Always
worth
checking
them
out
as
prices
are
often
lower
than
their
big
rivals.
I
would
recommend
B&H
to
anyone
looking
for
photo/video
stuff!
Great

Partsgeek
sent
the

The
only

I

is
that
it

have
gotten
to
me
faster.

Otherwise,
all
went
well.
Our
car
was
ready
at
the

we
had
asked.

The
personnel
were
extremely
friendly,
giving
us
detailed
instructions
on
our
departure
from
the
rental
station.

The
vehicle
was
exactly
what
we
expected
and
performed
without
any
problems.

All
in
all,
a
very
positive
experience,

given
the

Not

I

Using

The

It

Ordered
a

(Grundfos).
Confirmation
by

of
order
then
nothing!
Contacted
Anchor
direct
and
they
seemed
to
have
mislaid
email
order.
Promised
to
get
back
to
me
within
a
short
time
period.
They
didn't!
I
rang
for
advice
one
day.
Ordered
the
next
and
took
delivery
right
on
schedule
the
following
day.
No
extra
delivery
charge
like
some
sites.
Took
care
of
my
issue
without

Very
efficient-
great
follow
up
and
super
easy
to

resolved.
Had
my

the
next

A+!
I
have
been
shopping
from
BH
Photo
for
many
years.
Prices
have
always
been
very
competitive.
Shipping
has
been
first
class.
Quality
of
information
on
products
has
been
excellent.
Always
buy
my
photo
equipment
from
BH
Photo
Supplement
warehouse
is
the
shizzle.
They
got
almost
every
supplement
at
the
most
competitive
prices
on
the
net.
Also
their
shipping
rates
and
speedyness
are
unmatched.
I
love
yall
:)
Have
been
using
them
for
years
-
can't
fault
the
service
Hennie
has
always
offered
a
good
choice,
and
its
"UK
legal"
section
is
especially
helpful
if
you
want
a
high
quality
legal
carry.
I've
browsed
Hennie's
site
for
years
and
bought
an
axe,
pruning
saw
and
various
knives,
all
of
which
have
delivered
exactly
as
advertised
.I'd
recommend
the
site
to
anyone
interested
in
bushcraft,
high
quality
tools,
or
just
a
good
practical
pocket
knife.
Always
my
fist
choice.
I
bought
a
LUK
complete
clutch
kit
including
the
clutch
disk,
pressure
plate,
flywheel,
and
a
slight
bonus
of
a
cheap
plastic
alignment
tool.
The
tool
packaged
loose
inside
the
box
with
the
other
heavy
components
however,
and
was
crushed
in
shipment.
Whenever
I
contacted
Parts
Geek

online
about
receiving
a
replacement
tool
(something
that
cost
a
few
dollars
and
very
little
to
ship),
the
representative
instead
began
the
return
and
refund
process!
No
way
I
was
going
to
ship
this
clutch
kit
back
at
a
weight
of
32
lbs.
The
clutch
comes
pre-assembled
and
can
be
bolted
on
as
a
unit,
so
the
tool
probably
isn't
necessary,
but
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
just
in
case.
As
it
is,
I'll
just
do
without
and
hope
I
don't
need
it.
I
replied
to
the
rep
asking
for
the
return
process
to
be
cancelled.
We'll
see
what
happesn.
Difficult
to
find
spares
easily
identified
on
a
really
well
organized
web
site.
It
also
contained
useful
advice
that
the
manufacturers
had
changed
the
handle
on
the
shower
valve
I
was
repairing.
Absolutely
right
and
allowed
me
to
order
all
the
correct
parts
to
start
with.
I
bought
a
few
items
from
this
shop
now
and
am
never
disappointed.
Everyone
should
buy
from
them
if
you
need
car
parts.
No
integration
with
frequent
traveler
programs
hence
just
good
for
off
grid
bookings
I
had
some
doubts
about
taking
a
step
back
into
time
when
I
purchased
a
new
Merkur
34C
safety
razor.

Those
doubts
vanished
after
my
first
shave
this
morning.

Not
only
is
the
Merkur
a
pleasure
to
use
but
I
have
never
been
able
to
get
a
truly
smooth
shave
using
a
store
bought
razor.

West
Coast
Shaving
has
great
prices
and
impeccable
customer
service.

I
would
highly
recommend
them
for
all
of
your
shaving
needs
they
have
a
wide
list
of
new
parts
for
your
old
car
Where
is
my
part?
WE'LL
SEE
IF
YOU
DELIVER

TIME
AND
ACCURATELY
I've
been
using
Onnit
products
for
3
or
so
years
now
since
hearing
about
it
on
the
JRE
Podcast
and
have
never
been
disappointed
with
them.

Quality
is
always
high;
packaging
is
always
adequate
and
appropriate;
and
communication
with
customer
service
has
always
been
pleasant
and
professional.
I
ordered
this
part
from
this
place
as
it
had
the
best
value,
it
was
at
my
door
in
just
a
few
days!

While
looking
for

of
lites
for
my
daughter
for
christmas,I
located
your
website
found
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for;
at
a
cheaper
price
and
the
item
I
purchased
arrived
on
time
and
the
quality
was
better
then
the
more
expensive
one
from
a
designer
website
thanks
a
million
she
was
very
happy
and
so
was
I.
Try
this
service
once.
You
will
be
satisfied
completely,
and
wondering
why
you
didn't
do
it
before.
The
vehicle
was
great
but
not
the
vehicle
we
had
specified.

to
do
all
my
online
shopping
from
a

online
warehouse.
Since
discovering
B&H,
I
have
now
made
this
place
my
favorite
"shopping

for
my

Their
service
is
incredibly
fast
and
efficient.
My

have
never

Ordered

Had

The
lady
I
dealt
with
on
the
phone
was
extremely
helpful
and
friendly.
They
had
the
washing
machine
in
stock,
I
wanted
it
delivered
on
a
Saturday,
this
wasn't
a
problem
and
I
didn't
even
pay
for
delivery!
They
kept
me
well
informed
about
delivery
and
it
came
exactly
on
time,
brilliant
service.
Thanks.
Has
been
working
nicely.
Keep
the
good
work.
We
picked
up
our
car
in
Edinburgh
downtown
and
delivered
it
5
days
later
at
Gatwick
London.

Very
low
rate
(half
of
Avis'
posted
rate)
and
no
dropoff
charge.

No
additional
charges.

Perfect!
Good
product
and
very
fast
delivery.
What
else
to
say?
Thanks
a
lot!!
What
can
i
say
for
such
an
excellent
service,ordered
items
on
a
Sunday
and
its
arrived
on
a
Tuesday
Morning.
I
was
well
pleased
on
how
smooth
their
web
online
order,easy
to
fill
in
and
was
happy
to
provide
proof
of
age
via
email.Simply
and
straight
to
the
point.Wish
other
online
shopping
should
take
notice
on
how
Heinnie
Haynes
do
business
-
simple
and
fast
delivery.
I
bought
2
Bryton
Rider
40's
from
these
guys,
and
something
from
ordering
to
delivery
was
awesome
product
arrived
next
day.
Outstanding
selection.
I
really
liked
the
learning
videos.
Service
was
excellent,
but
not
too
happy
with
product.
The
checkout
process
was
simple
and
easy
to
follow.

I've
done
business
with
B&H
before
and
I'll
gladly
do
business
with
them
again
in
the
future.
B&H
provides
a
well-designed
interface
facilitating
informed
purchases
online.
All
the
information
I
need
to
compare
products
and
make
an
informed
decision
is
contained
and
easily
accessible
on
the
B&H
website.
I
have
macular
degeneration----need
a

Your

is
outstanding
in
brightness
and
flexability.
I
have
2
of
them---one
in

and

office.
Made
a
chore
easy
and
I
like
that.
Thanks!
Love
your
store,
love
what
you
stand
for.
I
would
love
you
even
more
if
you
started
making
jiu-jitsu

I
would

this

I
paid

I
received

my

(Even
if
it
was
over
the
weekend
which
I
don't
think
they
ship
during
that
time)
But
ordered
it
Friday
I
think
&
got
it
Tuesday.
Can't
ask
for
more
than
that.
Would
recommend
Huntoffice
based
on
ease
of
online
ordering,
price
and
delivery.
I
ordered
on
a
Monday,
and
got
goods
at
0815
on
Tuesday!
They've
got
a
very
full
range
of
stock
and
at
the
best
prices.
What
more
could
you
ask
for?
The
site
was
easy
to
navigate
through
and
was
impressed
by
the
speed
of
delivery.
Ordering
on
line
was
easy.
Sehr

super
B&H
is
quite
possibly
my
favorite
store
in
the
world.

Service
is
attentive
and
knowledgeable
whether
I
am
purchasing
in
the
store
or
online.

Great
prices,
great
service,
fast
shipping.
We
used
an
offer
from
Bounty
which
got
us
a
good
price
but
the
delivery
service
was
a
complete
mess.
Ordered
the
item
on
friday
at
noon,
got
a
call
from
them
on
monday
to
confirm
my
delivery
details
for
some
reason,
and
they
told
me
I
would
get
my
item
the
next
day
(Tuesday).
The
item
didn't
turn
up
and
I
wasn't
contacted
at
all.
The
next
day
(Wednesday)
I
got
an
email
saying
that
City
Link
(their
delivery
service)
had
issues
picking
up
items
that
previous
night
and
thus
I
wouldn't
be
getting
my
item
until
Thursday,
however
they
would
upgrade
my
delivery
to
a
before
12pm
delivery
to
compensate.
Thursday
came,
and
it
got
to
1pm
and
still
no
item,
so
I
phone
the
customer
service
number
and
they
said
that
City
link
had
made
a
mistake
with
my
item
and
not
upgraded
it
to
before
noon
delivery
so
I
would
still
be
getting
the
item
just
at
a
later
time.
Just
incase
its
better
to
be
safe
than
sorry
I
have
never
lost
my
mobile

before
but
thing's
happen...!
I
love
the
new
grafix
card
i
got
from
you
but
my
FRAP

or
frames
per
second
hardley
changed.
Greatest
selection
and
best
price.
Ordered
a
part
which
was
the
cheapest
price
I
found
after
searching
the
net
for
hours.

Contacted
the
owner
over
Aim
the
following
day
to
make
sure
the
part
was
in
stock
and
would
ship.

I
was
assured
it
was
and
it
would
meet
my
deadline.

Later
that
day
I
received
tracking
info
and
the
delivery
date
was
projected
as
sooner
than
I
expected
as
they
shipped
with
slightly
faster
shipping
even
though
i
did
not
ask
for
this.

So
far
this
is
an
A+
in
my
book.

I
will
come
back
again
and
point
people
to
VR
Speed.
A
friend
of
mine
wants
too
be
apart
of
this
wonderful
site
It
is
very
easy
to
use
and
sort
of
exciting
to
actually
have
a
winning
bid
and
find
out
the
place
that
was
selected
is
a
place
you
would
have
chose
yourself
except
much
cheaper.
I
had
two
major
issues
with
my
previous
home
telephone
service,
quality
and
cost.

Fortunately
I
solved
both
problems
by
signing
up
for
PhonePower
.

I
can
now
hear
all
of
my
phone
calls
clearly
no
matter
what
type
of
service
the
other
party
is
using
(cell
etc.).

I
also
appreciate
the
many
features
that
come
with
my
phone
and
my
cost
is
much
less
than
my
previous
service.

Although
there
is
a
maximum
minute
cap
to
my
plan
5,000
minutes
is
more
than
enough
for
our
family!

I
am
a
very
satisfied
customer!!
Great

Very
easy
to
talk
to
people
and
service
is
fast
and
smooth
I've
been
buying
products
from
B&H
for
over
10
years,
I
believe,
including
some
video
cameras,
lenses,
zoom
controllers,
and
more.

I
just
can't
say
enough
about
their
good
service,
not
only
delivering
products
on
time,
but
service
on
the
phone.

That's
a
huge
one
for
me.

I
truly
trust
them,
even
with
the
higher
dollar
sales.

Great
job,
and
great
service,
B&H.

Keep
up
the
good
work!
I
first
thank
you
for
making
my
hotel
reservations
consisting
of
three
separate
rooms
but
feel
that
I
was
a
little
deceived.
I
reached
out
to
the
Hilton
Garden
Inn
/Cleveland
Airport
and
when
I
did
not
see
a
phone
number
I
noticed
the
word
"agent"
which
I
assumed
was
a
Hilton
reservations
employee.
I
made
my
reservation
and
when
I
arrived
at
the
hotel
I
learned
that
I
had
not
spoken
with
a
Hilton
employee
but
with
Expedia
or
some
other
outside
reservation
host.
In
this
event
I
was
liable
for
all
three
rooms
on
my
credit
card
therefore
one
of
my
business
travelers
could
not
receive
his
Hilton
points,
etc.
The
end
results
were
good
relating
to
the
reservation
and
stay
but
the
agent
should
be
identified
as
an
outside
host
and
not
give
the
impression
they
are
associated
with
Hilton.

If
I
missed
any
such
disclaimer
I
will
be
the
first
to
say
I
apologize.
The
Photon
light
is
easy
to
carry
so
I
always
have
it
with
me.

The
battery
life
is
excellent
so
its
always
ready.
I
was
first
fully
impressed
that
I
received
my
order
in
just
about
24
hours
with
the
standard
shipping
choice.
This
would
have
been
a
different
review,
had
I
received
the
right
part.
I
ordered
an
air
filter
for
my
car.
The
air
filter
that
was
delivered
is
not
for
my
car.
I've
tried
numerous
times
to
submit
a
support
ticket
via
the
web
and
call
with
only
an
automated
reply.
So
now,
I
have
to
pay
to
send
it
back?
This
is
a
bad
policy.
There's
clearly
some
incorrect
entry
in
their
database,
or
the
wrong
part
was
pulled,
but
the
customer
shouldn't
have
to
be
responsible
for
their
mistakes.
This
is
where
human
interaction
is
needed
to
review
this
scenario,
(the
website
probably
still
has
an
invalid
entry).
Maybe
someone
at
PartsGeek
will
read
this
and
at
least
fix
the
website
if
not
contact
me.
I
wont
be
back
Whenever
I'm
shopping
for
electronics,
I
always
check
with
B&H
first.
They
stock
quality
products
and
typically
have
competitive
pricing
on
those
products.
When
I've
had
to
call,
their
customer
service
reps
have
always
been
knowledgeable
and
friendly.
Long-term
efficiency
and
quality

Solid,

I
had
two
payments
to
send
from

to

and
I
sent
the
smaller
one
first
to
test
things
out.
It
went
through
just
fine
in
two
working
days
with
a
charge
of
less
than
£2,
so
I
had
no
hesitation
sending
the
larger
amount
(over
£5000).
I
was
able
to
speed
up
the
payment
by
inviting
some
friends,
so
the
recipient
ended
up
receiving
the
money
the
same
day.
The
larger
amount
cost
about
£23
in
fees,
but
considering
my
bank
would
have
charged
a
fee
of
at
least
£25
and
then
would
have
made
money
on
the
exchange
rate
as
well,
I
came
out
well
ahead.

I've
been
purchasing
outdoor
gear
and

from
this
company
for
some
time
now
over
the
net.
I’ve
always
found
them
to
be
exceptional
to
deal
with.
Their
stock
is
varied
and
up
to
date
with
the
latest
released
gear.
They
have
friendly
knowledgeable
staff
that
go
out
of
their

to
help
you.
They
accept
returned
items
with
no
fuss
and
exchange
or
return
your
credit
to
you
in
very
quick
time.
They
send
items
out
to
you
amazingly
quickly
and
everything
is
tracked
so
you
can
keep
tabs.
In
my
opinion
they
are
a
modern
company
who
know
how
to
treat
a
customer
the
old
fashioned
way.

do
the
legwork.
The
information
is
accurate
and
the
rates
are
competitive.
I
only
use
other
booking
services
for
my
personal
travel
when
Easytobook
does
not
cover
the
specific
area
I
am
interested
into,
or
if
for
any
particular
reason
I
need
to
book
through
a
different
channel.
SUPPLEMENTWAREHOUSE
offers
the
best
price,
best
quality,
and
best
selection--bar
none!

I
searched
the
web
and
not
only
do
they
match
the
least-expensive
price,
but
they
beat
it!!!
Shipping
is
immediate
and
I've
never
had
a
problem.

I
highly
recommend
this
site
for
all
of
your
supplements,
vitamins,
etc...
The
fact
that
you
can't
speak
to
an
actually
customer
service
person
makes
it
impossible
to
return
a
part.
Even
through
all
the
packing
the
part
is
still
broken.
The
most
competitive
price
on
the
web
did
not
in
this
case
mean
poor
service
and
out
of
stock
items.
My
tent
was
dispatched
quickly
by
parcel
force
and
I
was
kept
informed
of
dispatch
and
delivery
times.
Pleasantly
surprised
and
I
would
not
hesitate
to
use
again.
I
have
emailed
Springer
letting
them
know
that
the
price
on
the
receipt
does
not
match
the
price
on
my
American
Express
bill.
It's
a
source
of
grief
for
my
accounting
department
every
month.
I
went
on
this
site
and
was
happy
to
be
able
to
find
different
storage
units
in
one
area.

I
was
able
to
compare
prices
online
and
found
a
good
deal
on
this
Website.

I
highly
recommend
this
site
for
location
a
storage
space.
They
know
how
to
take
care
of
their
customers.
👍
Always
great
selection
of
sale
items!!
Order
was
placed
and
shipped
very
quickly.

Very
happy
with
the
experience.

Thank
you!
hi
I
bought
my
drysuit
from
these
guys
and
im
delighted
with
it.
It
arrived
at
my
home
very
quickly.

there
size
charts
are
spot
on.
I
am
as
wide
as
I
am
tall
and
was
worried
it
wasn't
going
to
fit
but
the
charts
allowed
me
to
be
as
close
as
possible.

I
really
was
impressed
by
the
service
I
received.

I
genuinely
wont
buy
from
anywhere
else.
And
my
guess
is
if
you
find
it
cheaper
and
you
phone
these
guys
they
will
help
you
out
big
time.

I
ordered
a
Xmas
gift
for
my
wife
from
your
website
and
it
did
not
arrive,
so
I
did
not
have
a
gift
for
my
wife
on
Xmas
day.
The
site
is
simple
to
navigate
so
finding
what
you
want
is
fast
plus
the
option
to
compair
products
is
realy
handy
and
the
free
post
is
good
.
I
for
one
will
be
shopping
there
again.
OK,
but
I'm
not
your
advertising
agent
They
have
quality
parts
.Great
prices
and
quick
delivery.
I
love
this
website,
there
is
so
many
amazing
clothes
and
it's
very
easy
to
command,
pay
and
ship.
I
would
recommand
it
to
anyone
!
I've
used
pdhsports.com
quite
a
few
times
now,
and
have
received
the
same
excellent
service
every
time
-
it's
been
faultless.
The
web
site
is
great
but
if
you
ever
have
to
speak
to
someone
in
person,
the
people
at
pdhsports
are
great
too...and
that
counts
a
lot!
Ordering
is
easy...delivery
is
really
fast...the
customer
service
is
superb...don't
go
anywhere
else...I
won't!!!

Ordered
parts
from
two
warehouses.

One
came
in
a
couple
of
days
and
the
oither
was
over
a
week.

Problem
was
that
after
continual
contact
with
PartsGeek,
could
not
get
any
information.

If
I
order
again,
I
will
because
I
cannot
locate
the
parts
anywhere
else.
Couldn't
be
happier
with
the
package

I
received
or
with
the
ease
of
which
I
purchased
a
second
"lot"
for
my
cousin.
I
was
looking
for
an
Argyle
and
waistcoat
package
and
this
turned
out
to
be
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for.
The
shipping
was
fast.
Received
the
package
days
before
I
was
expecting
it.
The
jacket
was
a
perfect
fit.
Am
already
planning
my
next
purchase.
I
ordered
two
parts
-
one
is
OK
but
the
other
is
the
wrong
part.

Site
was
not
the
most
helpful
in
making
sure
I
got
the
right
part
for
factory
replacement.
This
site
is
easy
to
use
and
I
have
received
a
quick
response
.
I
spoke
to
Paul
to
ask
advice
on
the
best
squash
racket
for
me.

He
talked
me
through
different
options
and
I
bought
one
at
a
price
that
could
not
be
beaten
by
other
suppliers.

I
also
bought
shorts
and
squash
trainers,
again
these
were
excellent,
quality
products
and
a
very
good
price.
All
arrived
the
next
day,
at
no
extra
charge.
Very
happy
and
would
recommend
them.
The
glasses
came
as
I
expected
and
have
been
great.
This
is
the
second
time
I
have
used
Simply
Snorkel,
and
on
both
occasions
the
whole
process
from
ordering,
to
notification
of
dispatch
has
been
fantastic.
But
best
of
all
is
the
text
/
e-mail
to
let
you
know
not
only
which
date
your
order
will
arrive
but
between
what
times!
Everthing
went
excellent
with
no
problem
It
was
a
fast
shipping
and
the
price
of
my
item
was
very
good.
I
chose
Merlin
because
a
friend
of
mine
talked
about
that
online
store
Great
prices
and
fast
delivery.

This
was
my
first
time
using
parts
geek,
and
I
am
hooked.

Thank
you
I
like
that
they
have
good
customer
service
at
all
times.
i
will
most
likely
refer
my
friends
to
supplementwarehouse.com
all
the
time.
i
like
the
low
prices
and
also
the
price
match
that
they
have.
I
received
my
Jeep
tail
light
assembly
from
PartsGeek
as
promised.
They
have
the
best
prices
anywhere
for
parts!
The
part
works
great,
shipped
faster
than
promised.
Got
the
squat
rack
with
pull
up
bar,
dip
bar,
rubber
mats,
competition
bumpers,
excalibur
bar,
competition
kettle
bells...what
else...hmm...I
think
thats
it.

Great
equipment
all
around.

Couldn't
be
any
happier!!

Good
stuff
but
without
the
rogue
or
other
name
brand
price...
They
didn't
have
the
spotter
arms
in
stock,
but
rogue
makes
some
that
fit
so
I
got
them
and
slapped
them
on...just
make
sure
you
get
the
right
ones
(dimensions).

Since
the
rack
is
universal
mostly,
you
can
accessorize
with
rogue
or
other
companies.

I
got
side
plate
racks,
and
just
use
those
instead
of
the
four
points
on
the
corners...thinking
of
cutting
the
corners
off,
use
sandbags
to
keep
it
on
the
ground
with
weigh
on
the
side...can
do
muscle
ups
and
pull
ups
all
day
without
it
rocking.

I
will
say
that
the
plastic
part
on
the
Jcups
or
the
rack
cups,
whatever
you
wanna
call
them,
fell
off
after
my
first
use...thats
the
only
issue
I
had.

Bumper
plates
and
Bar
were
great
no
issues,
and
customer
service
was
EXCELLENT!!
THANKS
GUYS!
I've
purchased
many
supplements
from
online

and
Supplement

by
far
has
provided
the
best
service
and
price.
i

it

and
good

just

worth!!!
cant
go
wrong
I
accidentally
cracked
my
wife's
laptop
screen,
and
was
looking
for
a
new
one.
Laptopscreen.com
had
the
lowest
price,
so
after
reading
a
few
reviews
of
the
site
I
decided
to
order
from
them.
I
was
given
a
delivery
quote
of
3
days,
but
I
ended
up
receiving
it
the
next
day!
The
screen
was
high
quality,
and
I
have
yet
to
notice
any
dead
pixels.
I
would
order
from
them
again,
and
recommend
them
to
any
of
my
friends
or
family.
I
purchased
the
pet
rug
for
my
son
and
daughter-in-law
for
the
two
dogs
and
it
works
very
well.
Great
product
&
service!
I
used
Fetpak
for
many
years
for
supplies
for
my
jewelry
business.
I
haven't
ordered
much
lately
as
I
am
terminally
ill.
But
I
am
training
someone
in
the
business
and
one
of
the
things
I
have
done
is
pass
on
my
list
of
trusted
vendors.
Fetpak
is
one
of
those.
They
have
a
really
good
reputation,
and
interesting
products.
Having
ordered
through
them
twice
now,
and
tried
their
protein
powders
and
immune
support
stuff,
I
would
highly
recommend
them.
Their
stuff
seems
pricey,
but
you
are
getting
what
you
pay
for:
quality
products!
I
trust
B&H
on
all
my
needs
when
it
comes
to
digital
video
or
photography
needs.
Always
easy
to
place
order
and
if
question
arrise,
customer
service
is
quick
to
answer.
Booked
air,
hotel
and
car
all
easily
with
good
pricing.

I
liked
the
fact
that
the
hotel
could
be
canceled
without
penalty.
Without
that
assurance
I
do
not
usually
use
Travelocity
for
hotels.
Ordered
a
bunch
of
flowers
for
my
wifes
birthday
-
excellent

-
delivered

and
the
driver
even
sang
a
bar
of
happy
birthday!!!
Excellent
quality
of
service
Ordered
the
pens
as
a
gift
for
my
father.
Delivered
to
his
address.
They
were
definitely
a
surprise
for
him,
they
arrived
next
day
before
i
had
the
chance
to
tell
him
they
were
on
their
way.
That
is
fast
efficient
service!
The
site
came
highly
recommended
by
a
friend
from
Moldova.
So
I
checked
it
out
and
found
cheap

to

The
whole

was

minutes
I
got

I
have
been
using
B&H
for
over
20
years.
Delivery
was
prompt,
shipping
was
a
little
expensive,
easy
to
install
&
working
fine.
Very
simplistic
ordering
system.
The
body
parts
all
fit
like
they
were
supposed
to.
We
needed
a
new
water
heater
for
our
1991
5th
wheel
.

We
did
a
little
searching
and
thought
we
found
what
we
needed,
but
called
to
be
sure.

The
rep
who
answered
was
very
helpful.

We
ordered
the
item
and
was
here
within
a
few
days.
Only
to
my
bank
account.
Excellent
follow-up
to
confirm
the
order,
quick
answer
to
any
question,
delivery
of
the
end
product
even
before
the
deadline,
quality
was
excellent...Really,
could
not
ask
for
more
I
have
now
placed
three
orders
with
PureFormulas
and
all
were
delivered
in
a
timely
fashion.

Prices
were
very
good
for
somewhat
hard-to-find
items.

The
higher
quality
lines
can
be
pretty
spendy,
so
it's
nice
to
find
lower-than-retail
prices
AND
free
shipping!

I'll
be
back!
Musclefitness.com
is
a
very
good

They
give
you
a

when
the

going
to
deliver
your
order
with
a
hour
slot
instead
of
other
companies
that
say

like
a
5

slot
so
you
have
to
wait
in

Satisfied
with

will
order

again.
Looking

There's

to
say
about
it
This

was
very
user
friendly
and
had
many
options

Everything

You

I
have
used
Trophies
and
Medals
for
a
number
of
years
now
to
provide
trophies
for
our
annual
golf
competition
outing
to
The
Algarve
as
well
as
other
competions
our
society
has
through
the
year.
A
number
of
us
travel
each
year
and
the
final
round
is
always
followed
by
a
mini
awards
ceremony
where
we
present
trophies
for
a
number
of
different
achievements
throughout
the
trip.
These
are
always
well
received
by
the
various
winners
and
offer
something
to
remember
the
trip
by.
I
would
certainly
recommend
Trophies
and
Medals.com
to
anyone
who
is
considering
a
trophy
for
any
event.
The
choice
available
is
superb.

I
just
finished
a
trip
form
Boston
to
FLA.
I
used
ship
sticks,
clubs
at
PGA
Village
Pt.
St.
Lucie
when
I
arrived.
They
were
returned
3
days
later
after
I
left,
in
my
garage.
Could
not
be
better.
I
fly
Jet
Blue
and
it's
$40
for
the
extra
bag.
For
$10
more,
no
dragging
the
clubs
to
the
airport
onto
the
courtesy
rental
van
to
the
rental
car
and
the
180
on
the
way
back.
Just
to
simple,
to
smart
and
to
easy.
.
Constant
updates
on
the
trip
each
way
through
the
ship
sticks
web
site.
10
others
I
traveled
with
did
the
same
thing,
no
complaints.
I
have
used
Transferwise
a
couple
of
times
now
and
have
saved
over
£140
due
to
a
far
superior
exchange
rate
and
less
charges
than
those
used
by
more
'traditional'
methods.
The
process
is
simple
to
set
up
and
use
and
on
the
one
ocassion
I
had
to
call
them
the
level
of
service
was
excellent.
Great
products,
great
service.

Have
always
been
happy
with
purchases
from
B
&
H.
Reasonable
price,
easy
to
use.
Would
use
again,
very
convenient.
I
needed
to
book
a
European
puddle
jumper
from
Florence
to
Paris.

Ebookers
had
by
far
the
best
options
and
lowest
fares
listed.

I
got
two
seats
on
Air
France
along
with
an
Air
France
record
locator,
but
no
confirm
from
Air
France
and
no
seat
selection
options.

I
guess
this
is
customary
in
Europe,
at
least
I
hope
so
!
A
genuine
company
that
wants
to
please
their
customers.
More
businesses
should
follow
their
lead.
All
products
ordered
were
of
good
quality
and
I
was
updated
regularly
on
the
delivery.
The
cheapest
and
biggest
range
of
supplements
I
have
ever
seen.
All
at
the
cheapest
price
around
with
the
best
delivery
service.
They
made
it
easy
to
find
the
exact
part
I
needed
(tail
light
for
F150).

They
had
the
best
price
I
had
seen
on
the
Internet.

I
got
it
in
a
few
days
after
ordering
and
installed
it
the
day
I
got
it.

Could
not
have
been
happier
with
the
whole
transaction.
Ordered
2

Great

The

I
absolutely
want
...
Fast
delivery,
without
being
gouged
for
the
shipping
cost.
This
place
has
constantly
provided
awesome
service,
for
dirt
cheap
prices.
I
constantly
support
them
because
I
don't
know
how
they
stay
in
biz
with
such
cheap
prices!
I
didn't
realise
how
much
you
get
for
your
money
which
was
a
nice
surprise,
I
would
easily
choose
this
over
buying
the
same
product
for
a
greatly
reduced
price.
I
got

I
was
really
pleasantly
surprise
to
see
how
easy
was
to
order
all
od
my
car
parts.
I'm
74
years,
and
I
had
been
ordering
parts
for
35
years.
Meaning
that
I
was
very
careful
when
checking
what
I
order,
however,
two
of
the
four
engine
mounts
were
wrong???
the
problem
was
we
have
then
order
locally,
wasting

time
in
waiting,
and
I
spent
two
extra
days
of
rent
car.
Therefore,
I
though
I
was
saving
around
$75
bucks
with
the
whole
order.
But
instead,
I
ended
up
(1)with

2
days
rental
$80
dollrs
(2)

having
to
process
the
2
wrong
parts
to
get
proper
credit.
Plus
now
to
follow
up
my
debit
card
to
make
sure
the
funds
are
back
into
my
bank
account.
Let's
see
how
all
these

things
and
handling
works
out
as
to
give
you
my
expert
opinion.
Write
as
if
you're
speaking
to
a
friend.
Fast
delivery,
cheaper
than
the
high
street
stores.
Never
had
any
problems,
staff
always
happy
to
help
you
find
what
you
need
at
a
great
price.
I
received
a
blower
resistor
for
an
old
Camry
and
had
no
issues
installing
it.
It
fit
very
well
and
works
fine.
The
best
part,
now
my

has
all

The

was
described
as

is

The

of

was

No

Agoda
is
a
fast
and
simple
way
to
book
your
hotel
room
without
any
hassle!!!

Agoda
is
always
cheaper
than
booking
with
the
hotel
directly.
Very
convenient,
much
better
then
banks!
Easy
and
cheap
to
transfer

Great!!!
I
bought

the
fridge
freezer
on
line
at
this
site
and
it
was
delivered
the
next
day.
The
lads
who
delivered
it
were
ever
so
friendly
and
helpful.
These
people
were
brilliant
I
was
ready
to
order
a
fuel
tank
and
my
total
was
$146.
I
clicked
the
[PURCHASE]
button
and
then
I
get
a
screen
saying
my
total
was
$288.
WTF?
If
you
call
the
phone
number
after
10
minutes
it
says,
"Due
to
high
call
volumes
we
cannot
answer
you
call
at
this
time.
Please
fill
out
the
form
on
our
webpage"
(or
something
similar
to
this)
and
then
it
hangs
up
on
you.
I
submitted
a
complaint
3
times
trying
to
get
them
to
stop
the
purchase
but
it
goes
through
anyway.
I
tried
to
explain
that
I
only
need
2
fuel
tanks
for
my
truck
not
2
but
it
finally
gets
stopped
and
the
money
is
credited
back
into
my
account.
Since
the
price
was
a
good
one
I
ordered
1
tank
about
a
week
after
my
funds
were
returned
but
they
never
processed
it.
I
had
to
go
to
their
site
and
track
the
purchase
to
find
out
it
had
been
cancelled.
No
email,
no
explanation,
nothing.
I
go
to
autopartswarehouse.com
and
asked
them
if
they
would
price
match
and
they
do!
They
have
email,
online
chat,
and
people
that
answer
the
phone
and
even
call
you
when
there
is
a
problem
with
out
of
stock
items,
or
anything.
A+,
lightning
fast
delivery,
awesome
customer
service.
Tried
to
get
a
replacement
screen
for
a
Toshiba
laptop.

Easily
found
the
proper
screen
and
it
arrived

quickly.

Helpful
illustrations
right
on
the
page
helped
me
to
decide
exactly
which
of
the
four
for
that
model
computer
was
the
same
as
the
one
that
came
with
the
machine.
First
class
service.
Would
recommend
anytime.
Everything
was
easy,
from
instructions
to
follow
and
processes
that
could
be
used.
Highly
recommend
to
use,
so
much
easier
than
trying
to
sell
old
phones
through
sites
like
eBay

PartsGeek
want
me
to
pay
for
shipping
the
parts
back!
Very
time
consumning
trying
to
get
this
sorted
out.
Should
of
just
gone
down
to
NAPA.
Will
not
use
these
GEEKS
again!
The
site
had
'free'
shipping
for
a
certain
amount,
but
they
deduct
any
coupons
from
that
amount,
so
it
is
no
longer
'free'
shipping.

My
$15
coupon
was
now
only
worth
$10.

Very
disappointing.

What
was
a
cost
savings
is
no
more...I
may
as
well
stop
at
the
local
supply
place
on
the
way
home
from
work.
Had
a
tight
deadline
and
they
delivered.
Cheers.
I
was
recommended

by

I
used

was

price
very
good,
the
quality
was
excellent.

I
booked
two
rooms
for
my

and
I
and
my
two
sons
joined
us.
We
were
attending
one
of
my
other
sons'
Wedding
in
Balboa
Ca.
I
had
booked
our
reservation
months
ahead
and
had
absolutely
no
problems
whatsoever
when
we
arrived.
I
showed
the
person
at
the
desk
my
paperwork
and
a
credit
card,
we
were
in
our
room
in
less
the
15
minutes.
The
facility
was
good
and
the
location
was
very
well
situated
to
where
we
wanted
to
go.
Order
received
days
later

expected.
Parts

Well
i
cant
deny
that
this
site
is
very
awesome
best
prices
i
have
seen
till
now
the
only
thing
is
they
may
take
2
to
3
hours
for
delievery
but
maybe
because
its
the
first
time
but
still
worth
waiting
:)
Actually
this
is
from
the
best
websites
i
bought
from
they
now
how
to
make
everything
safe
and
no
delay
they
are
very
trusty
site
with
perfect
in
everything
the
issue
i
hope
you
can
do
is
maybe
make
some
discounts
to
V.IP
customers
or
people
who
buy
alot
from
you
so
we
feel
we
are
special
with
some
discounts
offers

I
searched
on

"everywhere"
and
could
not
find
the
"12"x18"

filter,
with
a

that
I
needed
until
I
came
upon
this
site.
Not
only
that.
but
I
could
order
just
a
six
pack
at
a
time
instead
of
twelve.
This
site
was
a
pleasure
to
deal
with.
They
communicated
with
me
about
my
order
quickly
and
it
arrived
quickly.
After
doing
significant
damage
to
my
front
wheel,
I
contacted
my
LBS
to
get
a
new
one.
After
being
told
it
would
cost
almost
$170
I
decided
to
search
online,
that's
when
I
first
noticed
I
could
buy
both
front
and
rear
wheels
for
not
much
more
than
what
I'd
pay
for
just
the
front
wheel
here.
Reliable,
precise
and
always
helpful.
PerformBetter
is
the
company
I
can
recommend
strongly
with
up

I
would
have
no

in
ordering
from
them.

I
have

I
was
a
part
of
their
Arlington
October
class
and
would
like
to
say
that
their
instructors
and

is
awesome.
I'm
glad
to
mention
that
I

This
is
one
of
the
best
websites
I've
seen
for
booking
places
to
stay
in.
All
the
info
is
there,
the
price
for
the
length
of
stay,
and
how
great
is
the
hotel.
I'm
definitely
going
to
be
using
this
website
a
lot
for
when
I
have
to
go
on
trips,
or
whenever
I
want
a
vacation.

I
looked
for
hotels
in
Canada
and
I
found
the
greatest

customer

is
patient
and
kind.
Over
all,
very
great

would
recommend
it
to
everyone.
My
TV
and
receiver
started
malfunctioning
within
days
of
each
other.
Starting
a
claim
online
was
easy.
Squaretrade
sent
a
prepaid
shipping
box
for
the
receiver.
Two
days
after
dropping
it
off
with
UPS,
I
received
a
full
refund
for
the
receiver
because
it
was
not
repairable.
And
because
parts
were
not
available
for
my
aging
TV,
Squaretrade
refunded
me
the
purchase
price
of
the
TV
and
I
still
got
to
keep
the

I
ordered
a

Great

we
leased
a

for

pick-up
from

was
hassle
free
and
the
gentleman
gave
us
a
full
overview
of
the
car
which
we
never
got
when
we
leased
another
french
car
the
year
before.
We
drove
around
western
and
central
europe
for
100
days
with
no
hassles
at
all
and
dropped
it
back
near
Charles
De
Gaulle
airport
with
ease.
the
communication
via
email
for
the
drop
off

was
excellent.
I
would
hesitate
to
use
this
service
again
and
recommend
it
to
other
peolpe.
Very
impressed
with
the
range
of
goods
offered,
the
free
p+p,
and
the
generous
discounts
for
bulk
orders.
I
ordered
at
3pm,
goods
were
here
the
next
day
at
11.
I
was
impressed
by
the
staff
at
the
fitting
centre,
they
started
the
job
exactly
at
the
time
when
the
car
was
booked
in,
and
within
an
hour
4
tyres
were
fitted,
an
oil
change
completed,
and
advice
was
given
to
me
about
a
suitable
spare
for
the
car,
as
it
is
not
a
standard
fitment.
For
rental
cars
and
hotels
-
you
cannot
beat
the
price
-
especially
if
u
bid.
Flights
are
okay
but
can
at
times
be
inconvienant,
you
need
to
be
very
flexible.
Cars
are
the
easiest
because
you
get
exactly
what
you
bid
on
and
although
you
cannot
use
your
gold
status
or
emerald
if
you
let
the
agent
know
when
picking
up
your
vehicle
you
part
of
program
from
which
are
renting
they
usually
will
either
upgrade
u
for
free
or
give
u
a
good
choice.
Hotels
the
same
if
you
bid
on
hotels
by
star
level
and
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
a
hotel
you
are
member
there
is
a
good
chance
when
u
check
in
they
and
tell
them
u
r
gold
member
they
will
treat
as
such.
At
times
it
can
be
somewhat
tricky,
but
if
you
know
the
area
you
usually
get
a
great
hotel
at
up
to
60%
off.
The
only
draw
backs
are
you
cannot
cancel
or
change
your
reservation
if
you
bid,
you
must
prepay
and
if
want
to
extend
your
stay,

u
may
get
the
same
rate
or
better
but
you
have
to
pay
the
same
booking
fee
again.

I
read

and
was

were

so

Partsgeek
is
okay
for

just
like
all

they

around
and

from
many
to

you

Great
item,
Great
price
and
Great
service........
The
service
seemed
pretty
easy
to
use
and
quite
quick,
just
took
a
week
for
the
money
to
come
in.
In
your
email,
you
stated
it
would
only
take
a
couple
days
for
the
money
to
be
transferred
into
my
account.
But
it
seemed
to
take
a
week.
But
good
service
and
deal
:)
straightforward,
stress
free,
efficient
delivery.
I'd
recommend
it.
First,
their
selection
is
Amazing!
Pretty
much
anything
I
want
I
can
get
it
from
them
as
far
as
my
needs
go.

(videography/photography).
Their
customer
service
is
fantastic,
friendly
courteous,
they
don't
try
and
up-sell
me,
they
are
pleasant
with
returns,
or
order
cancellations.
I
really
haven't
had
a
better
buying
experience,
when
shopping
online.
When
searching
for
parts
on
internet
pictures
are
the
most
important
thing
especially
car
parts.
The
prices
are
good
when
the
descriptions
are
correct
the
products
are
as
described
but,
a
lot
of
times
the
descriptions
are
terrible.
I
bought
a
lot
of
suspension
bushings
replacements.
Some
of
the
items
did
say
each
or
2
required.
But
other
instances
a
part
was
twice
as
expensive
for
the
same
looking
part
only
1
arrived.
There
is
no
1
800
number
to
call.
Shipping
was
fast
and
arrived
quickly
but
I
find
it
a
little
ridiculous
that
you
have
to
pay
separate
shipping
cost
for
items
are
in
various
is
warehouses.
You
must
know
exactly
what
you
want
or
else
you'll
end
up
wasting
your
time
buying
parts
you
won't
use
or
waiting
for
another
1
to
arrive.
These
guys
give
great
service,
the
prices
are
very
competitive
and
postage
is
reasonable
(if
not
free,
as
mine
was!).

I

month-over-month.
Every
time,
something
else
is
missing.
I
like
having
these
things
delivered
to
me,
because
it
provides
real
convenience,
but
the
supply
chain
is
completely
random,
which
defeats
the
purpose.
The
amount
of
variation
among
products
and
bargains
provided
make
this
site
an
absolute
must!
The
service
was
great.
I
received
my
parts
faster
than
I
expected.
I
would
definitely
recommend
them.
And
I
will
continue
to
do
business
with
them
myself.
No

and
have
always

My

have
been

I

Excellent

I
ordered
the
part
on
Wednesday
afternoon
and
I
was
surprised
when
the
postman
arrived
with
it
on
Thursday
morning.
I
couldn't
ask
for
more
than
that.
Everything
was
great,
fast

Purchased
>
$2600.00
of
equipment
from
DRIS,
really
fantastic
stuff.

They
had
my
size
of
White's
Fusion
"One"
drysuit
(which
I
thought
was
impressive
since
this
is
a
brand-new
drysuit
model)
but
they
were
out
of
a
particular
brand
of
knife,
as
well
as
the
Oceanic
DataMask.

My
problem
isn't
that
they
were
out
of
these
items.

It
was
that
they
didn't
TELL
me
they
were
out
before
I
made
my
purchase.

So
I
had
to
make
my
first
3
"no
instructor"
dives
without
a
computer.

Don't
hesitate
to
cancel
on
the
items
they
didn't
tell
you
they
were
out
of
stock
on....and
find
them
elsewhere.

I
really
like
DRIS
and
will
continue
to
do
business
with
them...
I
hope
you
get
to
work
with
Debbie,
she
is
a
real
professional.

I

Great

I
couldn't
really
ask
for
anything
more.
I
can
see
with
them
OK,
but
the
right
lens
keeps
falling
out
and
they
took
several
weeks
to
get.
Wouldn't
use
again.
I
was
pleased
to
find
the
repair
parts
for
my
truck
that
were
much
cheaper
than
going
to
my
local
auto
shop.

I
look
forward
to
saving
all
of
that
labor
money.

Thanks,
PartsGeek!
The
treatment
by

has
been
perfect.
The
customer

is
very
very
good.
The
shipping
was
fast.
The
value
for
money
is
good,
I
recommend
this
company.
I
purchased
a
loose
heart
shaped
diamond
from
Brilliance.com
and
had
them
set
it
into
a
custom
claddagh
that
I
designed
and
drew.
They
mocked
up
the
ring
on
autocad,
quickly
made
a
series
of
revisions
that
I
asked
for
and
threw
in
three
small
emeralds
for
free
after
I
decided
they
would
make
the
ring
look
better.

The
whole
process
took
about
a
month,
and
the
staff
couldn't
have
been
friendlier
or
more
helpful.
Thank
you

for
a
painless
process
that
resulted
in
a
unique
engagement
ring
for
my
(now)
wife.
This
was
an
awesome
experience.
I
damaged
my
iPhone
5
beyond
repair.
I
submitted
my
Square
Trade
claim
on
line
by
answering
a
few
simple
questions.
They
approved
my
claim
almost
immediately
and
sent
a
refurbished
unit
overnight.

The
replacement
cell
looks
and
performs
like
a
new
iPhone
5.
I
will
never
purchase
cell
phone
protection
through
my
cell
carrier
again.
I
will
ONLY
use
Square
Trade
from
now
on.

Thanks
Square

AWESOME!!!

excellent
service
The
product
was
excellent
as
was
the
delivery
.
The
website
product
descriptions
and
product
information
were
excellent
.
My
only
problem
was
with
the
ordering
using
the
quick
route
which
was
ambiguous
and
resulted
in
my
mistakenly
ordering
the
same
product
3
times(
the
message
I
received
using
the
fasr
route
suggdested
to
me
that
my
purchase
had
failed
as
did
my
second
attempt)

an
error
which
was
noted
too
late
due
to
my
recieving
3
email
receipts
and
order
numbers.However
the
error
was
rectified
following
a
phone
call.
The
website
was
easy
to
navigate,
easy
to
search
products,
very
good
prices
and
brands.
The
shopping
process
was
easy
and
delivery
was
on
time.
Would
use
the
site
again!
the
right
part
the
first
time
and
it
arrived
in
three
days
Age
is
catching
up
with
my
shower
and
parts
that
should
be
fairly
easy,door
trims,
to

are
now
not
available.
Great
Service,
prompt
delivery
and
a
superb
product
This
is
my
4th
time
buying
parts
from
PartsGeek
simple
fast
and
great
prices
will
keep
me
as
their
customer
The
website
was
easy
to
work
and
ordering
the
product
was
simple.
Shipping
cost
was
a
nice
surprise.
These
days
it
seem
like
some
vendors
make
more
off
whipping
and
handling
as
they
do
on
the
product.
They
are
going
to
be
a
great
gift
for
the
holiday.
A
simple
puncture
i
thought,
but
turns
out
i
needed
a
two
new
tyres.
Looked
around
the
usual
suspects
but
turns
out
that
these
guys
were
the
cheapest
and
also
the
quickest
to
come
to
my
house
and
fitted
it
quickly.
Amazing
service
with
great
offer
of
free
shipping
which
is
by
far
the
most
rapid
delivery
I
have
had
from
any
retailer
including
those
deliveries
I
had
also
paid
for
!
I
always
use
you
as
you
are
dependable.
Brake
calipers
were
like
new.
They
came
with
all
the
items
needed
to
install
the
new

The
only
bad
part
is
the
return
postage
for
the
core.

I

from

and
haven't
ever

have
always
been
correct
and
sent
on

Also
they

they

I

not

If

I
have
had
Gotabackup
for
around
a
year
and
a
half
now
and
the
experience
has
been
flawless.
I
found
Gotabackup
when
looking
for
a
cloud
backup
service
one
day
and
came
across
their
site
and
was
amazed
by
the
price,
£2.99
for
unlimited
backup?!
Count
me
in!
The

in
updating
me
on
the
status
of
my

and
followed
through

as

Booked
a
last

and
it
was
flawless
from
start

the

Need

I

like
the

There
is
a

however,
my

have
stopped
showing
up
in
my
account.

My

is
still

not
my

I
actually

The
manager
greeted
me
with
a
smile
and
was
very
thorough
in
going
through
all
of
the
details
of
my
rental.

The
facility
is
well-lit
and
seems
very
secure
which
is
the
main
thing
I
was
conerned
about
in
leaving
materials
in
a
storage
facility.
I
got
what
I
paid
for
and
the
part
was
in
excellent
condition.
Really
easy
website,
very
clear
and
I
got
exactly
what
I
wanted
having
searched
DIY
stores
high
and
low.
Ordered
small
magnets
to
hold
drawers
closed
on
a
sideboard
that
keep
opening.
Magnets
well
packaged,
looked
perfect
for
purpose.
Unfortunately
the
magnets
were
too
powerful
for
the
glue
that's
supposed
to
stick
them
to
the
desired
object.
Rendering
them
pretty
useless
and
not
fit
for
the
pretty
easy
job
I
needed
them
to
do.
A
small
order
this
time,
but
just
as
always,
was
dispatched
and
received
quickly
and
efficiently.
Understood
what
we
needed
and
was
able
to
help
at
a
better
price
than
we
could
have
hoped
for.
I'm
one
of
those
people
who
are
very
picky
about
their
pens.

I
ordered
flowers
for
my
girlfriend
in
Edinburgh.
I'm
an
American
so
I
don't
know
what
the
flower
business
in
the
UK
is
like,
and
my
girlfriend
had
previously
told
me
that
flowers
are
very
expensive
over
there.
So
when
I
saw
bouquets
for
£20,
I
didn't
know
how
nice
they'd
be.
I
was
also
worried
she
wouldn't
get
them
if
she
wasn't
home
for
the
delivery.
But
they
left
the
flowers
at
her
door
and
they
were
beautiful.
This
place
is
now
my
UK
florist.

so
I
decide
to
go

to

for
the
pan
that
have
drain

I
found
some
web
site
carry
the
part
I
need
but
their
price
higher
than
PartsGeek
so
I
placed
the
order...
and
the
parts
arrived
to
my
house
5
days
later

Thank

I

ordered

Invariably
my

exactly

This
is
a
totally
reliable
company

I

the
quality

from

is
the
best
I've
found.

helpful
and
easy
to

We
have
a
Kettler

it
needed

I
found
this
company
via
a
web
browser
and
liked
what
I
saw
on
their
website,
placed
the
order
and
was
impressed
with
the
service
provided,
would
happily
recommend
them
to

Purchased
an

a

from

and
the

were

immediately.
Loved
the
fact
that
you
are
given
a
1

slot,
saves
waiting
in
all

Would
definitely
use
them
again.
Purchased

Great
service
-
very
fast,

accurate
and
efficient.
I
hunted
website
after
website
and
couldn't
figure
out
what
all
I
needed.
Their
site
was
direct,
explained
everything
and
had
complete
packages
in
different
price
ranges.
Since
this
was
a
surprise,
I
had
to
guess
on
some
measurements.
Their
customer
service
noticed
I
may
have
the
sizes
wrong
and
sent
me
info
to
make
corrections.
It
would
have
been
way
off
if
they
hadn't
taken
the
time
to
ask
me
questions.
It
was
as
good
a
shopping
experience
as
I
could
have
hoped
for.

A
reasonable
price
on
a
furnace
with
free
shipping.

This
is
my
second
time
ordering
from
eComfort.

The
furnace
arrived
precisely
in
the
promised
time
frame...
ALTHOUGH,
the
shipping
company
(Pitt
Ohio,
not
eComfort)
called
me
almost
a
week
before
to
tell
me
my
order
was
ready
to
be
picked
up...
which
it
wasn't.

So
I
drove
40
miles
to
their
office
for
nothing...
a
strange
mix
up,
but
not
eComfort's
fault,
and
the
furnace
was
still
delivered
on
time.

I
just
felt
I
had
to
mention
that.
I
decided
to
give
your
company
one
more
try
because
you
do
have
good
prices!
The
last
time
I
purchased
a
few
items
I
got
burned
with
the
wrong
part.
It
was
listed
wrong
and
I
emailed
back
4
times
trying
to
get
the
sales
person
to
see
the
mistake!
All
4
times
I
was
greeted
with
(You
ordered
the
wrong
part,
please
pay
the
shipping
and
send
it
back
for
a
refund)
I
can't
pay
the
shipping
both
ways
when
its
not
my
fault!
The
part
was
listed
wrong,later
someone
finally
understood
what
I
was
telling
them,
the
part
had
the
wrong
number
on
it.
24
hours
later
the
mistake
was
corrected
on
your
parts
list,
but
I
still
wasn't
satified
with
the
wrong
part
I
received
and
I;m
not
going
to
pay
the
shipping
to
send
it
back
because
it
easn't
my
mistake.
The
parts
I
have
order
right
now,
if
they
arrive
in
good
order
that
will
be
great
because
I
saved
a
lot
of
money!
But
if
this
happens
again
I
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
other
company
I
have
been
doing
business
with!
I
ordered
some
products
at
16.30
in
the
evening
and
yet
my
goods
where
at
my
home
at
12.40
the
very
next
day
free
of
charge.
I'll
definitely
be
ordering
from
echo
again.
I'm
not
a
regular
customer
but
have
ordered
on
four
or
five
occasions
over
the
past
couple
of
years.
They
always
have
what
I
want
and
the
service
is
better
than
excellent.
Standard
delivery
always
arrives
the
next
day.

Very
trustworthy
and
reliable
10/10.
Ordered
two
books,
neither
of
which
I
had
heard
of
before
—
one
on
seafood
cookery,
one
on
Moorish
design.
Both
excellent
and
arrived
in
good
time
in
perfect
condition.
And
at
a
very
good
price
The
labels
were
exactly
what
I
wanted.
I
was
able
to
easily
able
to
create
the
design
on
the
website
and
place
the
order.
The
shipping
was
fast,
I
received
the
labels
within
a
week
of
placing
the
order.
I've
made
a
reservation
for
a
room
with
a
private
bathroom,
which
I
think
well
equipped.
The
best
point
was
that
the
TV
was

IPTV
so
that
I
could
watch
movies
or
musics
on
over
120
channels.
We
ordered
heart
labels
for
wedding
favors.

The
turnaround
time
was
great
and
we
had
what
we
ordered
in
less
than
a
week.

This
was
our
first
experience,
and
it
was
great.

Thank
you.
Not
only
did
they
had
the
specific
sunglass
model
that
I
was
looking
for
but
they
also
had
the
best
price
online,
received
the
Ray-Ban's
withing
a
few
days
and
everything
went
as
smooth
as
it
could
have
gone.
Parts
Geek
came
through.
My
order
came
in
damaged
but
I
also
order
the
wrong
item.

Parts
Geek
made
it
simple
to
return
and
get
the
correct
item
in
a
timely
manner.

Good
job.
I
was
drawn
to
visit
the
site
for
the
first
time
because
of
the
great
sale
prices
on
Fit
Flops.

A
query
about
ordering
was
dealt
with
very
quickly
and
the
upgrade
to
next-day
delivery
without
having
to
spend
a
fortune
was
a
real
bonus.

Not
only
did
the
shoes
arrive
promptly
and
well
wrapped
but
the
returns
process
was
very
simple
(and
free)
and
my
refund
was
processed
in
just
a
couple
of
days.

A
big
thumbs
up
to
Shoetique!
I
have
never
been
disappointed
with
a
Cultpens
order.

As
a
stationery
obsessive,
I
love
the
huge
variety
on
offer
on
their
website
and
their
service,
with
orders
being
despatched
super
fast,
is
second
to
none.
Great
Looking,

Easy
to
do
it
yourself.

Thanks
alot.
I
have
not
yet
installed
the
items
I
ordered,
but
all
appear
to
be
correct
and
in
good
condition.
I
ordered
split
pins
for
the
CV
axles;
not
knowing
if
they
were
supplied
with
the
axles...they
are,
so
I
have
2
extra
pins;
well
unless
I
screw
up
during
installation
and
damage
one.
I
probably
should
have
asked.
I
believe
it
would
be
helpful
to
your
customers
to
be
made
aware
when
an
item
comes
with
the
necessary
installation
items
such
as
pins
and
nuts.
In
this
case
the
nuts
were
pictured
but
not
the
pins.
My
ONLY
other
miff
is
the
items
were
not
consolidated,
so
three
packages
arrived
over
3
days.
No
worries
guys.
Purchases
were
good
quality,
with
problem

Great

of

I
am
very
happy
with
the
Bosch

was
just
purchased.

I
might
pay

next

having

is
great.
Great

excellent

and

Same

We
found
that
everything
went

Booking

was

we
arrived.

The
owners
of
the

were
honestly

The

We
plan
on
using
the

of

.I
would
recommend
them
to
all
my
friends.
I
have
bought
tires
for
our
cars
from
the
Town
Fair
on
Federal
Road
for
years.

The
advertised
pricing
may
have
gotten
me
to
try
them
but
it
was
the
outstanding
service
that
has
kept
me
coming
back.

I
confess
that
I
have
had
to
use
the
'Free
Tire
Replacement'
service
more
than
once.
I've
been
using
Merlin
since
I
started
biking
20
years
ago,
when
they
appeared
as
a
four
page
spread
in
MBUK.
You
had
to
use
the
phone
and
everything
then.
They
have
been
great
all
that
time
and
generally
have
the
cheapest
prices
for
kit.
With
free
postage
and
delivery
within
a
couple
of
days,
you
really
can't
ask
for
more.
Excellent
place
for
service
and
supply
of
all
my
lighting
needs.
All
orders
are
delivered
promptly
and
as
promised.
When
I
need
to
rent
a
car
for
travel
overseas
I
always
use
DriveAway.
I
have
been
using
them
for
years
and
they
never
disappoint.
They
get
you
the
best
price
and
I
maen
the
BEST
price
from
a
range
of
reliable
car
rental
companies.
They
save
you
the
hassel
of
shopping
around.
It
is
so
easy
to
use
their
web
site
and
if
you
need
to
ring
them
for
any
reason
they
are
so
friendly
and
helpful.
They
are
great!
I
got
my
part
in
a
reasonable
enough
time,
not
lightning
fast,
at
the
door
2
days
later
like
some
places,
but
not
unacceptably
slow
either,
and
the
price
was
good
compared
to
others
I
found
on
the
net.
My
only
issue
it
is
that
it's
a
very
poor
color
match
to
my
trucks
interior.

I
have
a
99
Yukon
with
tan
interior
and
this
door
handle
is
a
much
darker
color.
Almost
brown.

Its
sort
of
in
that
in
between
zone
where
I'm
not
sure
if
it's
just
a
poor
color
match
by
a
cheep
Chinese
part,
or
if
it's
actually
the
wrong
color
meant
to
match
a
different
color
interior.

I'm
leaning
with
cheep
Chinese
part
since
I've
never
seen
that
particular
color
in
another
Yukon
interior,
but
I
may
be
wrong.

Aside
from
the
color
the
part
looks
like
it
will
work
fine.

I
care
more
about
function
than
form
in
this
particular
rig,
but
if
this
was
my
other
vehicle
I'd
send
it
back.

I
won't
be
able
to
judge
the
quality
vs.
stock
until
I
get
the
old
one
out.

The

The

was

and
the

were
here
on
time
to
finish
the
project
on
time.
The
purchase
was
easy
from
start
to

I
was
concerned
that
my
purchase
wouldn't
arrive
in

but
after
talking
to
the
sales
staff
was
told
that
they
would
do
their
best
to
meet
my
deliverly
date
and
I
would
be
told
of
any
delays
and
when
it
had
be

which
I
was.

When
it
arrived
I
was
very
happy
with
it.
I
absolutely
love
YesStyle,
and
all
their
products.
Every
now
and
then
I
check
up
on
the
website
to
see
if
anything
new
catches
my
eye
and
it
always
does
with
the
new
fashion.
I
discovered
YesStyle
in
March
of
2011
and
immediately
started
shopping
on
the
website.
I'm
glad
I'm
a
silver
member
this
year!
The
discount
and
coupons
help
a
lot
and
makes
me
want
to
shop
even
more!

I
have
ordered
shirts,
jeans,
belts,
accessories,
and
even
gifts
for
my
friends.
Of
all
the
orders
I've
made,
I've
never
had
a
single
problem
with
the
shipping
or
the
product.
Don't
let
the
negative
reviews
get
to
you!
Choosing
the
right
product
was
easy.
Purchasing
my
selection
was
easy.
And
guess
what
-
taking
delivery
at
the
notified
time
was
even
easier.
Our
company
has
ordered
from
Flashbay
for
several
years

I

The

I
installed
it
in
about

We
paid
400

up
a

in
Munich
and
drop
it
off
in
Rome.
Interesting
since
the
car
was
registered
in
Italy
and
we
were
returning
it
to
its
native
land.
We
rented
a
car
in
Florida
(USA)
one
time
and
dropped
it
off
in

(USA).
We
were

Great
site
and
great
service.
Wonderful
selections
with
great
prices...
Everything
went
just
as
advertised
and
the
product
was
just
what
I
wanted.

It
was
received
on
a
very
timely
basis.

Will
definitely
use
them
again
.
I've
used
these
guys
and
gals
for
many
years
now
without
issue.
Very
much
appreciate
you
taking
care
of
my
problem.
However
your
reply
to
my
problem
left
me
with
more
questions
than
answers
as
to
how
you
were
going
to
deal
with
it.
Only
after
looking
at
my
credit
card
bill
was
it
realized
that
you
refunded
me
for
the
defective
part,
if
I
had
not
been
in
a
hurry
I
would
have
ordered
a
replacement
elsewhere,
glad
I
waited.

The

I
especially
like
the
Wish

function
so
I
can
revise
my
choice
a
fews
times
before
making
the
purchase.

The
free

is
also

Bought

a

for

Just
as
I
expected
and
delivery
was
very
quick.

I
will
use
you
guys
again.
Can't
really
find
much
fault,
only
negative
is
they
sometimes
don't
have
the
size
I
need
in
stock.
First
site
I
go
to
for
sports
gear!
We
are
not
happy
with
Paypal.
We
did
over
a
Million
dollars
a
year
with
them,

have
a
10
year
history
and
then
they
decided
to
demand
with
out
choice
that
they
are
going
to

hold
10%
of
all
funds
for
90
days.

This
means
they
hold
$50,000.00
of
our
money
on
a
constant
basis
for
90
days.

So,
we
no
longer
use
their
service
for
money
services.
I've
been
doing
business
with
this
company
for
about
six
months.
And
I'vebeen
satisfied
so
far
.
Usually
have
to
buy
in
bulk
to
save
money
after
shipping.
It's
been
tough
since
i
got
laid
off.
But
enough
about
me
.
Plenty
off
free
samples
and
other
things
make
up
for
the
shipping.
All
and
all
very
satisfied
with
this
company.
Best
prices
on
the
net
for
sure
Kevin
showed
a
vast
knowledge
of
all
the
tires
in
stock.
He
walked
me
through
each
tire
to
find
the
set
that
suited
me
needs
most.
If
you
are
looking
to
waste
no
time
and
get
through
the
process
without
any
issues,
ask
for
Kevin.
You
will
receive
nothing
less
that
pure
professionalism.
Very
disappointed
with
trying
to
book
by
telephone.

Had
to
book
by
computer
and
that
worked.

The
telephone
operators
didn't
seem
to
know
what
they
were
doing.

Very
disappointing.
Fast,
simple,
comprehensive.
Awesome.
I
will
tell
you,
I
have
looked
at
other
supplement
shops
and
always
find
myself
coming
back
to
Supplement
Warehouse.

First
of,
it's
the
unbelievable
selection,
they
have
just
about
everything.

Second,
it's
the
pricing.

Normally,
they
are
the
lowest
I
have
found,
but
if
they
are
not,
they
will
match
and
beat
the
competitors
price.

How
awesome
is
that?

Finally,
it's
the
fact
they
DO
NOT
use
USPS,
so
you
actually
get
your
stuff
quick.

Shipping
charges
aren't
bad,
but
with
the
cheaper
prices,
it's
still
a
win-win.

If
you
haven't
tried
this
shop,
it's
worth
a
try.

I
have
been
a
loyal
supporter
for
years.
I
have
tried
a
few
different
discount
travel
sites
but
now
solely
use
flight
network.

The
serice
works
great
and
I
have
never
had
an
issue.
This
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
online
purchases
I
ever
made.
It
was
simple
and
hassle
free.
I
was
really
impressed
with
the
shipping
as
we
received
the
order
within
days
of
ordering
the
item,
especially
given
our
location
in
Canada.
My
daughter
was
really
pleased
with
the
prom
dress.
I
would
definitely
recommend
NewYorkDress.com
to
our
friends
and
family.
I
have
dealt
with
all
the
major
online
UK
music
shops,
all
are
good
but
chemical
takes
it
to
a
whole
other
level.
Top
notch
selection,
fair
prices
and
customer
service
like
no
other.
If
you
want
your
music
needs
looked
after
proper
well
look
no
further
than
chemical
records.
You
lucky
Brits!
If
only
we
had
a
chemical
shop
in
Canada
eh!!!
Get
with
the
times!!!!
Wife
and
i
both
have
a
Mac
book
and
iPods
it
was
a
pain
at
first
getting
used
to
them
but
now
i
won't
go
back.
Wife
and
i
love
to
use
it
on
deployments
but
not
always
reliable.
I
bought
six
bottles
from
Saratoga
after
doing
a
lot
of
searching
on
the
web
they
by
far
had
the
best
prices.
My
package
arrived
on
time
with
no
issues.
Will
definitely
use
them
again.
They
provide
a
very
good
service
at
good
prices.
Money
is
transferred
quickly
and
easily
seven
days
a
week.
Customer
service
is
very
good
too.
It
was
an
easy
efficient
service
from
start
to
finish.
The
remote
arrived
next
working
day
and
worked
straight
away.
This
service
is
by

My
review
is
above
I
searched
online
for
the
perfect
car.
After
Going
from
Used
Car
Dealer
to
New
Car
Dealer
I
came
across
Public
Motors.
I
was
skeptical
at
first,
but
ended
with
a
really
great
deal
from
their
Live
Auto
Auction
they
have
every
Sunday.
I
was
going
to
wait
for
Wednesday's
Live
Auction
but
couldn't
make
in
time.
I
never
been
to
a
live
auction
before,
so
it
was
fun
and
exciting.
I
found
a
nice
BMW
for
super
cheap,
just
got
the
car
so
no
issues,
runs
great,
I
even
purchased
the
warranty
which
was
great
since
most
auction
places
don't
offer
any
kind
of
warranty.
The
staff
we're
friendly
and
nice.
They
gave
me
no
pressure
and
explained
the
auction
process
to
me.
I
even
got
to
ring
the
auction
bell
after
I
won
the
bidding.
Overall
I'm
happy
with
my
new
car
and
would
recommend
to
my
family
or
friends.
Thank
You
Public
Motors!

Late
one
evening,
I
ordered
a
full
set
(black,
cyan,
yellow
and
magenta)
of
genuine
Lexmark
toners
for
my
Lexmark
C544dn
laser
printer.

Imagine
my
surprise
when
the
courier
delivered
the
consignment
the
next
morning.

This
is
a
company
I
will
definitely
order
toner
from
again.
I
have
been
ordering
from
B&H
for
many
years
now
and
I
always
get
great
service.
I
particularly
like
the
feature
of
their
website
that
shows
if
an
item
it's
in
stock
or
not.
I
have
always
received
what
I
ordered
in
a
timely
fashion
and
at
a
great
price.
Thanks
to
all
responsible.
From
placing
the
order
to
deliver
the
service
I
received
was
excellent,
Appreciate
the
variety
your

has
and
the
quality

I

all
I

is
I

James
over
at
Town
Fair
in
Woburn
did
an
excellent
job
going
over
tires
and
prices.

And
he
just
didn't
try
to
sell
me
the
most
expensive
tire.

There
were
a
few
service
fees
that
I
wasn't
expecting
,
but
they
were
explained
to
me
to
my
satisfaction.

They
also
estimated
90
minutes,
but
I
was
outta
there
in
70,
from
start
to
finish.

Will
definitely
go
back
there
for
tire
rotations
and
the
next
time
I
need
tires.

I
found
the
Critter
Control
staff
to
be
very
customer-oriented.

Only
issue
I
found
was
the
usual
scheduling
challenges
of
having
a
wide
time
window
concerning
the
actual
appointments,
as
Critter
Control
teams
are
in
high
demand.

My
team
was
delayed
due
to
a
morning
appointment
so
they
were
at
my
house
from
mid-afternoon
until
approximately
7:30
pm.
I
have
ordered

sadly
its

:(
I
was
surprised
to
visit
their
shop
in
Waltham
Abbey
and
find
it
closed.

I
spoke
to
Chris
who
said
their
online
service
was
still
cheap
and
good.

It
was.
This
was
the
first
time
i
had
bought
bulk

It

was
a
lot
cheaper
than
the
local
supermarket.
Zappos
is
one
of
the
best
stores
on
the
web.
I
just
love
their
products
and
the
customer
service
was
awesome.
Fast
delivery
with
good
prices.
Highly
recommended
to
everyone.
Extremely
satisfied
with
the
correspondence
and

the
shipping.
The
quality
was
great
as
well
as
the
price.
I
needed
a
clutch
for
the
A/C
on
my
Dodge
Ram
1500.
I
discovered
I
could
purchase
a
brand
new
compressor
with
a
new
clutch
attached
for
less
than
a
clutch
only
at
my
local
parts
store.
I
ordered
the
entire
unit
on
a
Saturday,
received
it
on
Tuesday
and
installed
it
on
Wednesday.
It
works
GREAT.
What
more
could
you
ask
for;
the
right
part
at
a
great
price
delivered
on
time.
I
may
never
go
to
the
parts
store
again.
Bought

The
whole

was

:-)
I
got
the

and
received
it
in
just
a
few
days.
I
would
recommend

I
went
to
have
my

from

and
they
noticed
I
had
a
bent
rim
and
one
of
my
studs
were
crossed

They
give
me
another
appointment
and
replaced
the
lug

and
stud!
They
and
even
swapped
out
the
bad
rim
for
free!!!
They
could
have
not
said
anything
about
the
rim
but
put
my
safety
as
priority.

I

appreciative
of

This
is
one
of
the
best

I
have

and
very
nice

No

Brilliance
was
absolutely
phenomenal.
After
doing
a
lot
of
research
both
in
the
on
and
offline
world
for
a
good
ring,
I
ended
up
chatting
with
a
member
of
their
staff.
They
were
easy
to
talk
to,
very
professional,
and
even
more
knowledgeable.
Even
more
impressive
is
the
fact
that
they
recommended
what
was
best
for
me,
not
what
was
the
MOST
EXPENSIVE.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
I
got
a
brilliant
elegant
engagement
ring
for
my
beautiful
fiancee,
that
was
at
a
great
price,
and
looked
even
better.
I
would
recommend
Brilliance
to
anyone,
and
in
fact
I
will.
Their
staff
cannot
be
beat,
and
their
quality
of
both
diamonds
and
bands
are
second
to
none.
I
will
definitely
be
using
them
in
the
future.
I
was
kind
of
scared
when
i
saw
the
package
in
the
mail
being
it
was
a
xmas
present
i
did
some
research
on.
I
was
expecting
a
little
more.
But
when
my
wife
opened
it
and
put
it
on
her
Nexus
7
it
was
perfect.
Exactly
what
she
wanted.
Actually,
I
did
not
get
screwed.
I
got
exactly
what
I
ordered
and
I
got
it
on
time.
The
printable
gauges
helped
me
get
the
right
thing
the
first
time.
I
will
use
bolt

again.
Really
pleased
with
this
rental.
I
booked
in
the
morning
and
they
upgraded
me
on
my
arrival
due
to
the
smaller
cheaper
car
being
not
available.
No
Questions
no
hastle.
The
only
quibble
if
you
could
call
it
that
was
that
they
did
not
check
my
damage
sheet
properly
at
the
pickup
side
or
process
it
at
the
end.
anything
could
have
happened
after
I
dropped
the
car
off
and
I
would
have
been
liable.
Otherwise
a
great
rental.
Would
use
again
no
problems
at
all.

It

Since
I

sometimes
i

This

I
have
now
used
Elite
Mountains
Supplies
on
several
occasions.
I
have
always
found
them

to
be
helpful,
very
competitive
on
pricing
(especially
on
promotional
deals),
offering
a
first
class
range
of
products
with
the
option
of
special
orders
from
the
manufactures
ranges
that
they
stock.
Items
have
always
arrived
promptly
via
inclusive
carriage
,
well
packaged
and
in
perfect
condition.
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
rep.
he
was
a
bit
over
apologetic
but
except
for
that
was
perfect
!
he
was
friendly
as
well
as
knowledgeable.
Used
GAK
a
load
of
times
and

is
always
as
good
as
it
can
be.
Order
dispatched
as
early
as
possible,
well

and
courier
delivers

Never

Got
some
men's
colognes
for
a
great
price,fast
shipping
too.But
I
have
serious
doubts
on
whether
they
were
genuine.Smell
lasted
barely
an
hour
compared
to
the
same
brand
from
Macy's.Won't
try
again.
Everything
they
have
in
stock
is
quality
gear.
Prices
reflect
that
but
are
fair.
You
know
you
are
dealing
with
a
trustworthy
trader.
I
bought
a
Warwick
student
guitar
bag
from
GAK
and
some
other
musical
stuff
from
Amazon
on
the
same
day.
I
received
my
item
from
GAK
quicker
and
had
more
emails
informing
me
of
progress
than
Amazon.
Bought
a
new
thermostat
for
shower
-
the
old
one
couldn't
get
above
luke

Magnets
are
magnets!

But
I
needed
the
strong
magnets
of
the
right
size
to
hold
secondary
glazing
(Acrylic)
frame
in
place.

The
brief
stated
that
the
frames
should
be
easily
removable.

Used
Forstner
bit
to
countersink

into
window
frame
(fill
/

so
not

-
used

I
arranged
my
rental
in
Ireland
through
Autoeurope.
So
far
so
good.
When
I
got
to
the
Hertz
desk,
I
was
told
that
€5000
would
be
blocked
on
my
credit
card
since
I
wasn't
taking
the
insurance.
My
credit
card
provides
the
various
insurances,
but
that
was
insufficient.
Fortunately
I
had
plenty
of

room
on
my
credit
limit
to
handle
the
charge,
but
it
did
trigger
an
immediate
fraud
alert,
due
to
the
large
amount,
to
which
I
had
to
respond,
in
order
to
get
the
charge
approved.
Autoeurope
should
have
specifically
and
clearly

warned
me
about
this
because
if
I
hadn't
been
able
to
cover
the
charge
I
would
have
not
been
able
to
rent,
or
would
have
been
forced
to
buy
insurance
I
neither
wanted
nor
needed.
Have
not
purchased
much
lately
from
them
but
they
are
competitive
and
very
reliable.
Ordered
a
tailgate
bar
for
my
Jeep
YJ...good
experience
and
will
consider
using
again
in
the
future.
We
ordered
the
Alloy
USB
Cards
with
our
logo
on
it.
The
contact
that
I
had
with
the
representative
was
amazing,
very
fast
response
and
provided
a
virtual
proof
of
the
USB
Card.
We
received
our
order
in
1
week.
The
cards
looked
amazing,
received
not
only
an
email
but
a
phone
call
to
confirm
that
we
received
our
order.
We
definitely
plan
on
using
FlashBay
in
the
future.
Excellent,
quick
service.
Very
polite

guys.
Great
communication
via

and

Great
2hr

Easy

Perfect
for

practically.
It
doesn't

any
better
then

for

and

I
only
shop
here
for
all
of
my
audio,

needs.
Thanks
guys!
Great
service
&
competitive
prices
although
I
wish
I
could
make
cash
payments

into
their
bank
like
2
competitors
allow
and
then
I
could
have
placed
more
high
value
orders.
All

Obtained

I
would
highly
recommend
this
site!

Not
only
were
they
quick
with
delivery,
they
had
the
best
price.

Very
reliable
packaging
also.
I
haven't
had
to
make
a
claim
yet
on
the
travel
insurance
I
bought
with
them
which
is
why
I'm
reserved
about
giving
full
stars.
Website
was
good,
easy
to
use
and
quick.
Fast
and
perfect.
I
had
to
change
date
on
my
ticket.
I
could
make
it
by

easily,
althought
it
took
little
time.
Fantastic
service,
I
recommend
to
anyone
Amazing.
I
called
in
needing
an
order
over
night,
it
was
on
my
door
step
less
then
17
hours
later.
This
site
has
had
everything
I've
needed
so
far
for
my
1999
Saab
9-5,
and
the
prices
are
quite
competitive.
I
also
like
that
orders
over
a
certain
amount
qualify
for
free
shipping.
They
have
processed
and
shipped
all
my
orders
thus
far
without
delay,
and
overnight
shipping
means
overnight!
Was
very
disappointed
with
the
excessive
follow
up
emails
and
advertisements!
We
have
been
using
Feedoptimise
for
quite
some
time
now.
I
find
them
to
be
well
on
top
of
things!
I
really
like
the
dashboard
and
reporting
they
provide.
It
certainly
makes
advertising
much
easier
to
manage.
I
recommend
feedoptimise
to
anyone
looking
to
advertise
through
feeds!
I
found
the
book
i
needed
for
half
of
what
it
would
be
newsy
the

Came
quick
and
everything
is
good.
The
part
I
received
came
when
promised
and
was
half
the

from
NAPA.
It
was
the
exact

This
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
purchased
an
item
through
American

They
have
great
customer
service
and
the
products
are
shipped
promptly.
As
usual
delivered
the
goods
on
time
and
as
promised
I
was
looking
for
a
replacement
rim
for
my
car.
Found
it
easily
on
Partsgeek.
Asked
a
few
questions
by
e-mail
and
they
answered
quickly.
Purchased
the
rim
and
was
told
it
could
take
up
to
7
days
to
get
it.
It
came
within
3
days
and
was
very
pleased!
Brand

and
it
was
exactly
what
I
ordered.
Pond5
has
provided
great
videos
and
music
that
have
enhanced
our
videos
and
improved
our
production
quality.
I'm
especially
fond
of
their
free
stock
video
choices.
I
don't
always
find
something
to
use,
but
their
offerings
are
always
interesting
and
visually
appealing.
Exactly
what
I
needed,
exactly
as
described,
fast
transaction,
fast
shipping,
good
prices.

Would
deal
with
them
again.
Excellent

I've

The
few
times
I've
had
a
query
I've
had
prompt
and
helpful
responses.
I
placed
a
order
with
them
and
in
10
minutes
I
received
a
email
.
Great
service!
They
are
a
racket.
I
believe
they
intentionally
send
the
wrong
part.
You
never
speak
to
anyone
just
submit
a
ticket,
I
knew
it
was
bogus
and
still
made
a
purchase.
You
just
paid
for
shipping,
have
to
repay
for
shipping,
restocking,
repurchase,
more
shipping;
bullshit..

I'm
generally
happy
with
my
experience
raising
funds
for
a
friend's
medical
expenses
through
GiveForward,
but
I
found
payment
options
confusing
as
they're
through
a
3rd
party
that
isn't
as
responsive
as
the
GiveForward
people
are.
Plus,
I
sometimes
found
the
GiveForward
website
itself
to
have
a
confusing
array
of
options
that
weren't
helpful.
Once
we'd
reached
our
goal,
GiveForward
continued
sending
out
notices
to
my
Facebook
feed
asking
for
donations
and
I
got
no
response
from
the
team
about
how
to
shut
down
the
fundraiser
before
the
time
span.
But
it
did
work
to
get
the
money
into
deserving
hands
and
I
would
probably
do
it
again
despite
the
difficulties.
facility
was
very
clean
&
well

&
secure.
I
feel
confident
my
belongings
will
be
safe
in
the
storage
unit
I
have
rented.
One
thing
I
thought
needs
attention;
there
are
a
lot
of
steps
to
get
to
the
office
which
older
people
may
have
difficulty
in
using.
The
office
needs
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
the
parking
lot.
Also,
the
road
to
the
storage
facility
needs
repair.
EVERYTHING
I
have
ordered
from
B&H
has
been
top-notch!

Ships
quickly
and
without
hassles!
Excellent
service.

Would
not
hesitant
to
recommend
to
a
friend.
Onnit
has
great
products
at
reasonable
pricing.
My
personal
favorite
are
the
TPC
packs,
definitely
one
of
the
premium
supplement
packs
on
the
market.
However
they
ran
out
stock
on
of
this
product
sometime
1st
quarter.
I
was
continually
reassured
that
the
product
would
be
back
in
stock
but
weeks
turned
into
months
&
it
didn't
happen.
I
sent
a
request
to
purchase
the
individual
supplements
at
the
same
rate
of
discount
as
the
packs
but
was
denied.
Finally,
a
week
later,
the
packs
came
back
on
the
market;
I
purchased
a
two
month
supply.
I
am
a
fan
of
Onnit
&
especially
TPC
however
I
like
to
stay
consistent
with
my
supplements.
If
I
had
to
endure
the
same
waiting
game
again
it
is
doubtful
that
I
would
continue
use
of
this
supplement.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
give
feedback.

the

more
could
you
want!?
I
recommend
anyone
looking
to
beat
the
outrageous
prices
at
big
chain
supplement
stores
to
shop
around
on
their
website.
It
won't
even
be
a
contest
on
whether
or
not
purchase
through
them.
I
liked
the
price,
just
didn't
like
the
fact
that
they
weren't
able
to
send
the
right
parts.
I
think
I'm
just
going
to
stick
with
the
dealer
for
all
parts
since
I
know
that
I'll
be
able
to
get
what
I
want
even
though
it's
expensive.
Excellent.
This
is
the
first
time
I
have
done
business
with
Reidys.
I
can't
wait
to
purchase
again.
Very
quick
courier
service.
Excellent
product.
Great
price.
Well
done.
Balance
Optics
will
not
only
give
you
best
value
for
money
you
will
also
get
top
class
customer
service.
Buy
almost
almost
all
my
tennis
stuff
from
Tennisnuts.
Would
recommend
you.
If
you
want
health
products
at
a
great
price
and
trustworthy?
Pick
pureformulas.
If
you,
like
most
golfers,
have
been
confused
when
your
trying
to
set
up
arrangements
The
first
time
that
I
have
purchased
replacement
cartridges
for
my
ink
jet
printer
and
I
will
certainly
use
the
service
again.
Fast
and
very
cost
effective
made
ordering
enjoyable.
Hey
my
controller
came
in
today
it
was
a
good
price
and
it
was
really
fast
shiping
if
theirs
a
place
I
want
to
recommend
my
friends

to
buy
Thier
controller
it
would
be
you
guys.
I've
been
ordering
from
Heinnie
Haynes
for
a
couple
of
years
now
and
have
never
been
disappointed.
If
I
had
more
money
I
would
order
a
lot
more
kit
from
them.
00000000000
Even
thoe
i
have
yet
to
put
the
part.s
on
the
wate
was
well
worth
the
price.
and
thanks
for
the
help
telling
me
which
was
up
stream
and
which
was
down
stream,
after
i
received
the
part,s.
I
had
a
question
concerning
the
proper
part
for
my
car
there
were
two
options

listed
on
their
web
site
but
only
one
would
be
the
correct
part.
I
tried
to
get
through
on
several
(3)
different
occassions
but
was
prompted
and
waited
upwards
of
8
minutes
each
of
three
times
(over
a
three
day
period)
and
a
recorded
message

came
on
each
time
saying
the
phone
agents
were


essentially
overwhelmed
and
to
leave
a
message
but
there
was
no
way
that
allowed
this
user
to
leave
a
message.

Finally
,
I
simply
tossed
a
coin
and
luckly
the
heads
was
the
right

call

.
Great
prices
though
willing
to
deal
with
the
lack
of
phone
agents.
If
you
order
without
the
aide
of
a
live
agent
it;s
seemless.
Not
being
very
computer
literate
I
rang
hifx
and
was
guided
through
the
process
by
a
very
competent
and
friendly
adviser.
The
company
provided
a
very
efficient
srvice.
Ordering
was
easy
and
I
was
easy
to
buy
quality
items
at
a
good
price,
delivery
was
as
described.
Convieient
and
easy!
I
have
purchased
multiple
items
from
B&H
both
Photo
and
Electronic
as
well
as
printer
cartridges
and
have
ALWAYS
received
excellent
service.

Also,
on
the
few
occasions
I
have
called
with
questions,
staff
have
been
knowledgeable,
courteous
and
helpful.
I've
been
travelling
frequently
to
Italy
this
summer
and
have
ended
using
DFDS
automatically
as
I've
been
so
impressed
with
your
customer
service.
My
last
2
trips
have
ended
in
a
mess
with
traffic
problems
meaning
last
minute
changes
to
plans.
I've
got
to
say,
both
times
the
UK
reservations
team
have
been
fantastic,
re
booking
me
no
fuss
or
drama
and
so
so
friendly!
Just
what
you
need
in
grid
locked
traffic
in
Luxembourg
when
you
realise
you
ain't
gonna
make
it!!!
I
absolutely
can't
communicate
with
them.
I've
emailed
6
times,
called
twice,
and
faxed
once.
No
reply.

I
didn't
even
know
that
my
order
for
a
Bosch
starter
had
gone
through
until
it
arrived.
Now
I
need
to
return
the
core,
but
can't
get
the
instruction
(I'm
supposed
to
email
for)
to
return
it.
This
will
be
a
great
deal....if
I
don't
get
stuck
with
the
$92.00
core
charge.
Is
anybody
there?
I
have
ordered
two
products
from
Heinnie.
Both
were
delivered
very
quickly,
especially
given
they
go
in
the
normal
post
(both
items
were
ordered
late
at
night,
I
then
received
them
not
the
following
day
but
the
day
after).

I
received
an
email
confirming
the
order;
another
to
confirm
the
product
was
being
processed
and
another
to
say
it
had
been
dispatched;
so
I
was
very
much
kept
'in
the
loop',
as
they
say.
Staff
were
very
courteous
and
exceptionally
prompt
on
filling
&
delivering
the
order.
Used
this
source
for
the
first
time.

Very
satisfied
with
product
and
service.
I
left
my
phone
in
the
rain
over
night.
I
was
able
to
dry
it
out
and
get
it
to
turn
on
but
the
microphone
wouldn't
work.
I
submitted
a
claim
with
SquareTrade
and
received
a
prepaid
shipping
label
the
next
day.
I
sent
the
phone
in
and
it
came
back
repaired
about
a
week
later.
I'm
happy.
It
was
exactly
what
I
needed
the
first
time.

I
didn't
have
any
hassle
purchasing
and
it
came
quickly.

The
price
was
at
least
half
what
my
quotes
were
locally.
I
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
a
supplier
of
A4
laminating
'photo'
pouches.
Previously
purchased
from
Rexel
but
who
no
longer
made
them
or
seemed
to
be
in
business.
After
extensive
Google
searches
The
Warehouse.com
were
the
only
company
who
identifed
the
last
few
remaining
stocks
in
the
UK
and
arranged
for
me
to
purchase
at
a
discount
-
all
within
a
couple
of
hours.
Service
and
efficiency
as
it
should
be.
With
some
trepidation,
I
ordered
a
basket
of
fruit
to
celebrate
a
gentleman's
birthday
from
a
place
of
which
I
had
never
heard.


From
his
reaction,
I
was
assured
that
he
received
exactly
what
I
viewed
in
the
website
selection;
therefore,
I
was
relieved
and
most
content
with
Ava's.
Couldn't
be
happier!

There
are
lots
of
negative
reviews
about
this
company,
my
experience
was
perfect.
I
just
ordered
more
parts!
I
have
to
say:
I'm
never
really
disappointed
with
my
online
experience
at
B&H.
If
I
have
a
question,
I
can
live
chat
with
an
associate,
get
all
my
answers,
and
purchase
the
product
that
best
fits
my
needs.
I
always
have
the
option
for
free
shipping,
and
that
works
for
me;
I'm
an
independent
filmmaker
on
a
tight
budget,
and
saving
money
where
I
can
is
always
a
HUGE
plus.
B&H
also
has
discounted
rates
on
a
lot
of
their
products
(especial
products
by
Blackmagic
Design,
which
I
purchase
on
a
regular
basis)
Great
prices
for
computer
memory.

Could
not
find
a
lower
price
for
the
memory
I
purchased.
I
have
purchased
recently
on
Amazon
and
it
was
fantastic
..
I
accepted
the
first
increase.
This
latest
is
over
$20/mo.
I
will
be
moving
out
asap.
Good
company
,
meet
there
time
scale
deadlines
90%
of
the
time
EASY
ORDERING,
VERY
FAST
DELIVERY.
GREAT
SERVICE
ALL
ROUND
Perfect
as
always
Easy,
prompt,
and
the
price
was
good.
Will
shop
here
again.
I
have
used
black
circles
for
the
past
few
years
on
my,
wife's
and
my
daughters
cars
and
never
had
an
issue.
I
always
get
them
fitted
at
a
local
fitting
station
and
again
never
an
issue
I
would
recommend
highly
Like
most
people
who
want
a
picture
framed
-
this
has
involved
driving
into
town,
paying
to
park,
hauling
the
picture
into
the
shop,
paying
up
front
and
then
waiting
three
weeks
to
go
in
again
and
collect
it.
I
ordered
white
goods
-
a
washer
dryer
-
on
line
for
the
first
time.
I
guess
because
there
is
no
more
Comet
!
Price
was
good
and
delivery
free
if
you
stay
in
all
day
!
They
also
call
and
send
texts
to
update
you
on
delivery
progress

-
which
you
can
do
yourself
as
well.
Two
guys
found
the
property
-
which
is
normally
difficult
to
locate
-
easily.
Petflow
is
awesome
I
suggest
any
animal
lovers
to
use
this
website
for
any
of
there
pet
needs!
Used
USRentacar
may
times
always
give
good
service
&
price
BUT
this
time
they
have
been
let
down
by
the
US
supplier
Budget
at
Tampa.
Booked
car
not
available
kept
getting
offered
upgrades
I
DID
NOT
WANT.
Then
told
only
had
Premium
rate
or
2
door
compacts
available
when
I
should
have
had
a
4
dr
intermediate.
After
20
hrs
of
travelling
I
just
wanted
to
get
to
bed
and
eventually
agreed
a
$10
a
day
upgrade
to
a
Ford
Escape
SUV
after
declining
attempts
to
get
me
to
agree
up
to
$50
a
day
upgrades.
Only
got
this
after
Manager
heard
me
say
I
would
put
this
on
internet.
Why
should
I
be
expected
to
pay
for
an
upgrade
if
the
hirer
has
not
got
my
class
of
vehicle
available.
Travelled
to
USA
many
times,
always
used
USRentacar
+
Budget.
Will
continue
to
use
USREntacar
but
Budget
-never
again.
I
can't
believe
how
fast
the
shipping
and
packaged
well.
Wonderfully
convenient
-
It
really
could
not
be
made
any
easier
to
dispose
of
old
mobile
phones.
Imagine
shipping
a
mirror
without
padded
packaging
material.

I
was
amazed
after
receiving
the
mirror
sticking
through
a
thin
cardboard
box
and
no
bubble
wrap
or
packing
peanuts
to
protect
the
glass.

Needless
to
say
the
mirror
was
received
broken,
and
it
is
now
three
days
and
counting
waiting
for
the
return
authorization
before
I
can
send
it
back.

I
will
not
reorder
this
part
from
Parts
Geek
and
only
hope
to
get
my
refund
in
a
timely
fashion.
Great
products,
great
site,
even
great
when
I
had
an
issue
with
something.
No
company
I
trust
more.
I
was
overall
very
pleased
with
my
purchase;
Heinnie
provided
means
of
tracking
my
package
which
I
thought
was
a
very
nice
touch.
I
was
able
to
check
for
myself
that
they
shipped
the
order
ASAP.
The
package
itself
was
delivered
within
the
indicated
time
frame,
in
good
condition,
sensible
packing
(foam
padding
etc).
Product
didn't
dissapoint.
I
went
on
line
which
is
all
new
to
me
being
an
old
fart
!
I
found
Heinnie
Haynes
site
and
I
have
to
say
I
thought
there
has
to
be
a
catch
here
(
its
bound
to
be
from
USA
)
but
no
its
was
from
Barry
the
home
of
Gavin
&
Stacy
!
the
price
was
good
and
the
service
was
very
prompt
(
I
did
not
pay
£5
for
next
day
delivery
being
a
mean
old
fart
)
Ordered
tags
for
my
son's
christening
and
they
were
amazing.
Came
in
great
quality
for
a
great
price.
When
I
received
them,
they
were
easy
to
assemble.
Very
good
site
with
excellent
service.
I
am
completely
satisfied
with
the
entire
process
of
buying
my
book
from
Bookbyte.
The
book
arrived
in
a
two
days
after
I
placed
the
order,
which
gave
me
time
to
read
the
chapter
before
my
class
begins.
Loved
the
amount
of
different
styles.
Made
me
super
excited
to
try
them
on.
Cant
wait
till
my
my
order
comes.

Booking
through

than

To
ensure
that
I
had
the
car
I
requested
some
8
months
earlier
I
visited
the
National
store
in
Anaheim
the
day
before
pick
up
and
asked
would
I
get
a
Mustang?
,they
checked
and
advised
that
I
would
have
one.Picked
it
up
next
day,ran
like
a
dream
had
more

a

as
I
was
going
with
an
Aussie
convoy
to
Vegas.Fuel
usage
was
23.3

not
bad,as
my
old
GT
Falcon
would
only
get
20mpg
or
put
simply
37.5ks
per
4.5
liters,
compared
32

note
these
are
smaller

than

did
quite
well

Thing
I
did
notice
that

In
all
cars.
Very
fast,
very
accurate.
Will
absolutely
order
from
again
if
needed.
Found
ALL
the
parts

I
need
in
one
location,
and
for
considerable
less
money
that
competitors
were
asking.
Same
parts
for
less
money
can't
beat
it!!
I
have
used
Blackcircle
twice
this
year
and
got
great
tyres
each
time
at
a
great
price.
I
picked
different
fitting
centres
each
time
but
received
first
class
service
from
both
of
them.
I
am
very
happy
with
my
purchases
and
will
use
Blackcircle
again.
Fast
and
correct
part
My
transactions
in
the
past
have
been
efficient
and
complete.
I
expect
the
same
this
time
too.
I
always
get
my
products
from
these
guys
quicker
than
expected.
The
people
at
onnit
run
their
company
the
way
one
should
be
run.
A
friend
of
mine
told
me
to
try
this
site
out,
it's
where
he
buys
all
of
his
supplements.
I
am
a
first
time
buyer
and
extremely
pleased
with
the
pricing
and
the
amount
of
supplements
available,
and
the
fact
that
if
you
do
find
something
that's
better

priced
wise
they
just
don't
match
it
but
they
beat
it
by
5%.
I
will
be
using
the
supplement
warehouse
from
now
on,
and
recommending
it
to
anyone
and
everyone
that
I
meet!!
I
ordered
a
part
for
my
sons
car
and
found
the
part
that
I
need
for
a
great
price
well
below
what
I
could
have
gotten
it
for
otherwise.
The
part
was
received
in
a

short
period
of
time
.
Would
do
it
again.
First
time
at
Town
Fair
in
Braintree
and
I
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
experience.
When
I
walked
in
the
door
I
was
greeted
by
a
friendly
sales
crew
of
Seth,
John,
and
Josh
they
were
fantastic
very
helpful
and
knowledgable.
I
felt
as
if
I
had
known
them
for
years.
When
my
truck
was
finished
I
had
the
chance
to
meet
the
three
techs
that
had
all
worked
on
it
to
get
me
home
to
my
family
faster.
I
wish
I
had
gotten
their
names
in
order
to
thank
them
with
this
email.
I
guess
all
I
can
say
is
that
I
had
a
great
experience
and
it's
all
due
to
the
outstanding
crew
that
works
at
that
location.
Ordering
parts
was
easy
but
when
choosing
left
or
right
that
was
confusing.
They
should
state
passenger
side
or
driver
side
.other
than
that
it
was
fast
and
way
cheaper
than
anybody
else.

Ordering
all
my
parts

now
on
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
purchase.


The
rotors
and
the
pads
arrived
in
nice
package
and
in
just
a
few
days
from
the
order.


Very
pleased
with
the
order
and
the
selection
and
price
that
was
available
at
PartsGeek.
Every
time
I
order
from
ONNIT
I
am
satisfied,
the
midwest
basing
of
the
company
makes
delivery,
even
the
cheapest
versions,
deliver
within
a
couple
of
days.
the
products
are
all
great,
and
all
transactions
have
passed
through
without
problems
and
have
already
recommended
this
company
to
friends
who
were
also
happy
with
them.
The
items
ordered
were
delivered
on
time
in
a
well
packaged
box.
I've
used
Whisky
Exchange
several
times
now
and
haven't
been
disappointed
We
were
looking
forward
to
our
new
bed.
When
it
arrived
some
boxes
were
damaged
and
one
box
was
open
at
one
end.
The
delivery
came
when
we
were
out
so
a
neighbour
took
the
delivery.
We
took
the
boxes
to
our
bedroom
and
opened
them
up
and
took
out
all
of
the
contents
in
preparation
to
build
the
bed.
It
was
at
that
time
we
noticed
that
there
were
no
fixings
so
we
had
no
means
of
putting
the
bed
together.
Having
talked
to
the
sales
staff
they
were
quick
to
help
resolve
the
issue
and
the
bed
is
up
and
fine.
B&H
is
absolutely
the
best
company
to
deal
with
when
making
a
web
order.
I
have
had
a
few
orders
that
needed
a
slight
adjustment
after
placing
them.
Customer
service
was
extremely
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
and
the
problem
was
always
fixed
before
the
items
shipped.
In
most
cases,
the
order
is
shipped
the
NEXT
business
day,
and
usually
the
shipping
is
FREE.
I
would,
and
I
do
constantly
highly
recommend
BH
to
everyone
I
know.
My
order
came
to
me
in
a
matter
of
seconds
:D
I
love

from

Hard
to

at

with

I
have
2
daughters
who
are
always
changing
phones
so
i
am
constantly
selling
the
old
ones
or
it
seems
like
that.
I
have
tried
other
companies
but
always
come
back
to
envirophone.
They
always
offer
the
best
price
regardless
of
what
the
other
companies
promise
and
the
process
is
very
quick
and
easy
and
I
trust
them.
I
have
recommended
them
to
friends
and
they
have
the
same
opinion
as
me.
I
will
continue
to
use
them.
Everything
about
the
shopping
experience
was
good
-
easy
to
select
product,
help
to
select
right
product,
easy
to
order,
arrived
in
good
time
in
good
condition.
Right

I
received

I
found
Battery
Force
some
time
ago
by
trawling
the
internet.
I
have
stayed
with
them
since
due
to:
Multitrip
were
very
helpful
-
they
had
automatically
renewed
my
policy,
but
included
business
and
Golf
travel,
which
I
didn't
want
this
year.
Rather
than
take
it
off,
they
found
it
easier
to
cancel
my
poilicy
and
renew,
which
they
did
without
fuss.
I
wanted
to
add
South
Africa
to
my
European
cover
for
a
two-week
holiday.
The
good
news
here
was
that
it
was
much
cheaper
to
cover
for
a
year
than
a
one-off
policy.
All
very
helpful
up
to
now.
Parts
were
for
decades
old

Jeff

I
have
no
hesitation
recommending
Anchor

as
they
were
well
priced,
efficient
and

on

what
I

Had

the

Very

I
would

The

enasbled
me
to

were

It

We
found
Blackcircles
on
the
internet
and
have
never
had
such
an
easy
time
in
finding
and
costing
a
set
of
tyres
at
a
very
reasonable
price,
saving
us
a
lot
of
money
compared
to
the
national
tyre
suppliers.
Blackcircles
ordered
the
tyres,
suggested
the
tyre
centre
and
we
were
given
a
choice
of
day
and
time
for
fitting.
On
the
fitting
day
the
tyres
were
there
ready
and
fitted
on
time.
We
were
very
pleased
with
the
whole
experience
even
to
the
point
where
one
tyre
still
had
a
lot
of
wear
left
so
was
given
that
tyre
back
as
an
extra
spare.

Now
with

I'm
saving
over
$14

and
that's
with

The

is

than

I
bought
a
few
hundred
dollars
worth
of
parts;
everything
was
delivered
on
time.
However,
before
spending
a
few
hundred
dollars
more
on
A/C
parts,
I
asked
for
some
clarification
on
the
compatibility
among
the
parts
I
am
intending
to
buy.
A
week
later,
I'm
still
waiting
for
an
answer
to
that
question.
Your

was

Fast

After

I

called
to

They
were
holding

for
items
they
said
might
never
come
in.
But
I
had
rec'd
an
email
asking
me
to
rate
their
company.
Obviously
they
didn't
realize
I
had
never
rec'd
my
order
I
ordered
a
pair
of
glasses
with
high
index,
prescription
lenses.

We
liked
them
so
well
that
we
wanted
to
add
anorther
set
of
prescription
lenses
to
a
frame
that
we
already
had.

ADS
never
hesitated
and
sent
us
a

Parcel
Hero
had
collected
our
parcel
in
London
and
delivered
it
to
Glassboro
outside
Philadelphia
USA
before
the
UPS
driver
had
even
turned
up
to
collect
it
(even
though
it
had
been
cancelled
)
and
the
best
thing
of
all
was
that
they
were
a
third
of
the
price!!!
I
found
this
company
to
be
extremely
responsive
and
they
showed
that
they
actually
care!!


Lots
of
outfits
say
they
care,
but
don't
really
act
that
way
when
it
comes
down
to
it.

Flashbay
was
different
and
we
WILL
be
ordering
more
products
from
them.
This
site
gives
the
impression
it
is
UK
based.
It
is
not,
it
is
actually
based
in
Denmark
-
which
is
not
mentioned
on
ordering.
You
are
only
made
aware
of
this
by
the
fact
the
invoice
you
receive
has
a
Danish
address.
This
adds
on
delivery
time.
I
thought
that
the
quality
of
the
product
was
good
for
the
price
and
the
customer
service
certainly
past
the
test
with
flying
colours.
Totally
satisfaction

This

I
bought
it
from
this

I

saying
it

the

To
be
fair
it
arrived
on
that
day
but
the
caller
to
me
was
rude
and
completely
failed
to

why
there
could
not
be

which
would

I
just

I
had
been
looking
for
Polar
Ice
after
shave
for
a
number
of
years.

When
I
found
West
Coast
Shaving,
I
found
gold.
They
are
helpful,
trustworthy
and
light
hearted.
Excellent
I
ordered
a
new
taillight
to
replace
one
that
was
shattered
by
an
unfortunate
parking
lot
incident
and
was
surprised
that
the
light
came
with
all
the
bulbs
already
installed.
It
also
came
with
a
bit
longer
wiring
than
the
original
which
helped
putting
it
back
together.
It
fit
perfect
and
works
like
new...
now
if
only
I
could
fix
the
scrape
in
the
paint
as
easily!!!
Will
definitely
order
from
PartsGeek
again
if
I
need
any
more
parts.
I'v
been
using
Goldstar
for
years
now
and
have
never
had
a
bad
seat
to
any
event
I've
purchased.
When
dealing
with
their
Customer
Service
I've
always
had
an
answer
the
same
day
most
of
the
time
within
hours.
Using
Goldstar,
I've
been
able
to
see
more
and
not
go
broke
at
the
asking
price.
I've
recommended
Goldstar
to
all
my
friends
and
family
and
will
continue
to
do
so.
What
is
not
to
like
about
something
happening
as
previously
notified
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
What
can
I
say
an
excellent
tyre
fitter
arrived
at
my
home
at
the
agreed
time
and
fitted
my
chosen
product
which
was
a
reasonable
price,
a
perfect
transaction.
I
ordered
a
couple
of
saucepans
for
my
induction
hob,
delivery
was
made
within
36hrs,
quite
astounding!
I
have
used
Glasses2you
for
a
few
years
and
apart
from
obtaining
my
free
eye
test
elsewhere
would
not
contemplate
any
other
source
of
spectacles.
The
service
is
better,
quicker
and
considerably
cheaper
than
my
previous
High
Street
optician,
which
incidentally
claims
to
be
the
quickest

and
cheapest.
The
product
arrived
the
next
working
day,
in
perfect
order
at
the
price
offered(with
a
free
chocolate),
what
could
be
better.
Fast
and
easy
process
to
find
the
item
I
was
looking
for
and
order
it.
seem
like
a
very
good
product
and
delivery
was
good
Great

best
autoparts
service
on
the

Thanks
Great
quality,
perfectly
packaged
and
really
fast

Could
not
have
asked

anything
more.
A+++
Brilliant,
free
postage
and
it
came
the
next
day,
cant
ask
for
better,
will
definetly
use
again.
Please
help
me
understand.
I
ordered
a
part
for
my
vehicle.
I
received
the
part
the
next
day,
which
was
a
heater
core,
but
was
missing
the
accessories,
such
as
rubber
seals,
gaskets
and
bolts
witch
showed
in
your
catlelog.
I
tried
to
call
but
coulding
get
through,
so
sent
an
e-mail
explaining
what
happing.
I
specifically
asked
for

this
is
what
was
on
my

at

I

not

We
wanted
an
automatic
car
in
Brindisi
and
so
we
took
what
they
had.

We
had
a
good
experience
with
AutoEurope.

We
have
rented
from
them
before.
Although
the
tent
has
to
be
shipped
to
Germany,
it
was
here
in
only
4
days.
The
tent
is
perfect
and
looks
like
discribed!
We`ll
use

B&H
always
has
what
I
need,
it's
always
in
stock,
they
often
have
a
free
shipping
option,
and
the

are
always
as
good

better
than
everyone
else's
-

Denise
was
fantastic.
She
was
very
timely
in
her
quotes
and
responses
to
my
questions.
The
print
job
on
the
flash
drives
was
excellent.
I
would
definitely
use
ipromo
again
and
will
recommend
to
others.
Best
experience
ever
I
bought
bar-style
coasters
and
they
turned
out
fantastic.

I
appreciate
the
great
variety
of
designs
and
customization
options.
Been
around
forever
as
a
bricks
and
mortar
store
in
NYC,
now
they
have
taken
their
acumen
to
the
web.
Love
them.
I
was
doing
my
daily
search
on
Booking.com
to
for
my
yearly
trip
to
Vegas
when
a
pop-up
with
a
great
price
appeared
on
my
screen.
It
was
significantly
better
than
the
prices
I
was
being
offered
so
I
quickly
investigated
this
opportunity.
The
easy
to
navigate
website
allowed
me
to
book
my
accommodation
quickly,
safely
and
efficiently.
Within
minutes
I
received
a
confirmation
email
in
clear
concise
language.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
this
price-saving
opportunity.
I've
always
been
delighted
by
the
prices
at
Shopto.
Free
delivery
that
always
arrives
within
1
or
2
days
is
just
the
icing
on
the
cake.
Shipping
was
great,
prices
were
great,
customer
service
amazing,
I
mean
it
was
perfect.
I
love
how
they
really
protect
and
take
care
of
your
order
and
gaurantee
safety.
Will
definitely
search
up
any
shaving
product
I
will
ever
find
on
the
internet
on
this
site
in
order
to
support
this
site
and
order
all
producrs
from
WestCoast
Shaving.
I
love
the
store.
It's
like
the
Fantasy
Island!
Only
thing
missing
are
the
girls
and
the
guys
dressed
as
hawaiians.
I
got
a
sales
email
from
Destination
XL
for
some
items
that
I
needed.
Decided
to
go
check
out
Big
Tall
Direct
before
ordering.
I
am
glad
that
I
did
as
the
price
from
Big
Tall
Direct
was
less
than
the
sale
price
at
Destination
XL.
Placed
the
order
and
had
the
merchandise
in
hand
the
following
week.
I
was
well
satisfied
with
everything
that
I
received.
Competitors
allow
you
to
pick
the
rental
agency
of
your
choice.
As
I
recently
had
a
horrible
experience
with
Europecar
at
heathrow,
this
is
a
feature
I
would
very
much
like
so
I
can
avoid
them
n
the
future.
We
took
the
afternoon
direct
Stonehedge
tour,
me,
my
husband
and
my
18
months
old
boy.
So
the
two
hours
in
the
bus
(4
hours
total)
was
a
little
hard
for
my
boy
;althought
having
an
Ipad
with
his
favourite
cartoons
was
a
huge
help.
Other
than
that
Stonehedge
was
just
wonderfull;
I
little
smaller
than
what
you
expect
by
seeing
on
tv
but
really
great.
I
really
recommend
this
tour.
I'm
not
great
at
DIY
but
the
video
explaining
how
to
fit
the
shower
handle
reassured
me
that
the
part
could
be
fitted
easily
in
a
few
minutes.
Great
selection,
fast
shipping.
I
have
been
ordering
knives
and
kitchen
tools
from
David
for
years.
He
always
takes
the
time
to
help
me
out
and
is
very
personable
and
easy
to
talk
to.
I
bought
a
Raspberry
Pi
from
MCM
initially.
The
RP
is
a
great
little
computer
and
I
thought
I
had
all
the
parts
necessary
to
get
it
up
and
running,
but
I
was
wrong.
Back
to
MCM,
they
had
everything
I
needed.
I
made
the
second
order
and
have
a
fully
operational
Raspberry
Pi,
now.
Fantastic
service
that
we
have
used
three
times
now.
Our
selected
fitters
are
always
friendly
and
efficient.
Wish
we
had
discovered
Black
circles
much
sooner.
Product
arrived
in
good
order
on
time
ansd
solved
the
problem
The
part
was
just
what
I
needed
and
I
got
it
quickly
and
with
no
hassle.
I
got
my
book
in
plenty
of
time
even
though
I
ordered
it
the
first
week
of
school.
It
was
also
the
best
price
I
found.
I
definitely
recommend
this
site
to
anyone.
Just
wanted
to
write
again
because
the
service
I
received
was
excellent,
product
is
excellent,
and
very
pleased
with
whole
experience.
Ordered
some
parts,
they
came
as
I
ordered
them,
I
would
purchase
from
them
again,
very
happy
cuatomer.
A+
Good
Standard
Price,
fast
shipping
and
reliable
knowledge
base.
Today
is
a
dangerous
world
and
I
love
how
secure
I
feel
with
my
credit
guarded.
so
easy
to
use,
just
park
on
the
car
park
just
across
the
road
from
the
terminal,
hand
in
your
keys
and
that's
it.
When
you
get
back
just
cross
the
road
and
pick
up

your
keys
and
your
car
is
there
ready
for
you.
Overall
a
good
experience.....
Was
Surprised
at
speed
of
delivery.
However
black
cartridge
comes
up
with
error
on
the
cartridge,
although
it
still
prints.
Looks
to
me
to
be
reloaded
cartridges.
Good
products
and
great
prices;
they
offer
a
wide
selection
and
even
match
prices
you
find
elsewhere.

I
have
been
using
them
for
a
few
years
and
couldn't
be
happier
with
the
products
and
service.
Over
all
I
was
inpressed
on
the
web
sight
even
though
i
believe
it
can
use
some
slight
changes,
But
I
had
no
other
problems
and
the
parts
arrived
way
before
I
expected
them,
great
job
on
that.
My
first
time
ordering
from
partsgeek
was
as
good
as
it
gets!

Firstly
they
had
the
exact
part
that
I
needed.

Secondly,
the
part
was
brand
new
(how
rare
is
that
for
an
obscure
part
for
an
18
year
old
Jaguar
XK-8?).



Third
and
finally,
the
part
arrived
in
three
days!!!
Fortunately
it
was
fine
weather
by
the
time
we

had
completed
the
paperwork
required
to
actually
load
ourselves
and
or
luggage
into
the
hire
car
as
it
was
some
distance
from
the

airport
building
to
where
the
car
was
parked.

Had
it
been
been
otherwise
I
do
not
see
how
we
could
have
got
ourselves
and
our
luggage
into
the
vehicle
without
one
of
us
having
to
extract
wet
weather
gear
from
our
baggage.
Rockhampton
seemed
to
be
better
laid
out
in
this
respect.
I
would
definitely
recommend
this
company
to
friends,
great
results
every
time!
Good
company
didn't
have
to
talk
to
know
one
I
have
been
in
the
process
of
working
with
Anne
from
I
have
ordered
several
items
from
B&H
and
they're
always
there
with
the
newest
and
latest
equipment.
A
super
company
that
you
can
trust
to
deliver.
If
I
have
to
order
parts
locally
and
can't
have
them
the
next
day,
Parts
Geek
get's
my
money.
The
front
tires
on
my
sons
car
were
severly
worn
on
the
outside
edges
and
the
steering
wheel
was
rotated
off
center
when
driving
straight.

I
suspected
the
front
end
was
out
of
alignment.

I
called
around
for
prices
and
an
opinion
on
the
repair.

Town
Fair
Tire
had
the
best
prices
and
gave
me
the
most
confidence
over

Whenever

or
repair,

is
#1.
An
excellent
service
at
an
affordable
price.
After
placing
the
order,
I
received
15
emails
stating
that
I
had
made
the
same
purchase
15
times.
I
wrote
an
email
expressing
my
concern,
to
which
I
received
an
automated
email
stating
that
customer
service
would
be
out
of
the
office
for
the
weekend
and
not
return
until
Monday.
This
was
on
a
Saturday.
So,
I
had
to
wait
2
days
to
find
out
if
I
would
be
charged
$30
or
$450,
which
was
disconcerting.

has
been
nothing

in

I've
used
B&H
for
years
and
have
never
had
a
problem.
Even
had
to
return
a
camera
to
upgrade
to
a
different
one,
no
problem.
They
told
me
what
was
wrong,
If
your
looking

There
on
the
internet
I
like
to
use
Goldstar
to
find
activities
for
myself
and
friends.

It
has
gotten
me
in
to
many
things
over
the
past
few
years
that
I
would
otherwise
never
have
known
about.

Plus,
it
saves
me
money
too!

My
only
complaint
about
Goldstar
is
that
the
booking
fees
are
not
shown
with
the
price
of
the
ticket,
so
I
think
I'm
paying
one
price,
then
when
I
go
to
check
out,
the
price
has
risen
due
to
the
booking
fees.

As

I

Cheapest
company
on
searching
the
internet,
after
order
I
was
told
that
what
I
had
ordered
was
no
longer
made,
which
could
have
been
annoying
if
it
wasn't
for
the
really
helpful
communications
offering
me
an
alternative
straight
away,
I
would
definitely
order
from
them
again
if
I
ever
need
to.
Woodyatt
were
absolutely
brilliant,
the
curtains
were
the
size
I
wanted
unlike
other
shops
where
you
have
to
make
do
with
standard
sizes,
the
choice
was
the
best
we
have
seen,
they
were
pack

and
each
packet
labelled
with
what
curtain
was
what
and
as
for
the
delivery,
that
was
unbeatable.
On
top
of
all
that
they
were
good
quality,
perfect
curtains.
Your
team
did
a
grat
job
of
helping
me
obtain
a
part
that
was
difficult
to
find.
This
allowed
me
to
get
my
machine
back
into
production
and
minamized
downtime.
Keep
up
the
good
work.
We
ordered
order
of
service
prints
and
a
couple
of
posters.
The
quality
was
exceptional
and
could
not
believe
how
low
the
price
was.
Very
professional
service
and
kept
me
updated
each
step
of
the
way.
Turnaround
was
near
instant!
Look
forward
to
using

Bought
a
couple
coax

by

I
am
always
amazed
at
the
products
B&H
has.
I
have
bought
several
items
from
them
in
the
past
and
always
had
an
excellent
experience.
I
travel

5

Buying
a
set
of
new
tires
is
an
expensive
investment,
and
only
two
years
ago
I
made
that
investment
going
to
a
local
place
that
went
out
of
business.


Today
I
hope
I
made
the
right
decision
coming

to
TFI.

They
matched
a
quote
a
received
from
a
local
auto
shop,
but
offered
more
options
than
the
shop
going
forward.



The
salesman
was
honest,
helpful,
and
down
to
earth.


I
would
recommend
TFT
to
a
friend.
Recommend
to
my
trends.
As
a
sales
professional
in
San

BoxBee
helps
keep
me
organized
and
allows
me
to
manage
my
business
without
clutter.
It
is
simple,
efficient
and
affordable
and
helps
me
do
my
job
better.
Great
prices
and
toner
always
delivered
the
next
business
day.
The
material
was
very
informational
and
the
teaching
style
is
very
good
and
easy
to
understand
and
follow.
Awesome
job
As
a
first
time
customer
I
was
made
to
feel
as
though
my
business
mattered
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
order.
I
was
in
touch
with
the
same
person
throughout
the
order
process
and
nothing
was
too
much
trouble
for
him
to
explain
or
action.
I
am
extremely
satisfied
with
the
service
provided
and
with
the
products
I
received
which
also
arrived
very
quickly.
Many
thanks

I
ordered
a
set
of
winter
tires
2
week
prior
to
the
Christmas
Holiday
break,
paid
the
full
amount
and
paid
extra
for
fitting.
The
week
prior
to
the
break
I
received
confirmation
that
the
tires
had
been
delivered
to
the
garage
that
would
fit
them
and
was
given
the
time
of
day
that
they
would
be
fitted.
As
I
had
chosen
a
mobile
fitter
I
gave
them
a
good
few
hours
after
they
should
have
been
fitted
as
I
thought
they
could
be
busy
on
the
lead
up
to
Christmas.
When
I
called
up
Blackcircles
to
ask
what
the
hold
up
was,
I
discovered
that
they
had
not
delivered
the
full
set
and
would
only
be
able
to
fit
2
of
the
4
winter
tires,
also
the
garage
was
now
busy
and
wouldnt
be
able
to
fit
them
until
the
day
after
(I
was
at
a
client
site
280
miles
away
from
home
and
was
due
to
drive
home
that
night,
so
had
to
stay
another
day
and
another
hotel
bill).
I
don't
know
much
about

I
do
know

not

but
its

I
was
offered,
that

goes
on
my
list
of
online
suppliers.


Prices
are
very
keen.


Their
website
and
trading
history
instil
confidence
in
the
company.


My
only,
small,
criticism
is
that
there
is
no
tracking
facity.
I
decided
to
research
coffee
bean
grinders
and
was
eventually
drawn
to
the
BellaBarista
website.


As
I
had
not
used
a
coffee
grinder
before
I
needed
a
little
handholding
to
make
sure
I
didn't
spend
my
money
unwisely.


I
found
the
information
on
the
well
laid
out

website
both
comprehensive
and
helpful.


I
liked
the
look
and
price
of
the
Eureka
Mignon
and
cast
around
to
find
a
comparative
review.


The
review
I
found
compared
four
ginders
and
the
Eureka
Mignon
was
the
recommended
grinder
of
the
four.


This
was
good
enough
for
me
so
I
put
my
order
in.


Delivery
was
prompt
and
came
in
earlier
than
promised
and
packing
was
more
than
adequate.

I
would
say
that
my
overall
impression
of

an
ethical

had
a

I
understand
that
this
could
have

the

still
it
was

to
have

in
the
manner
I
did
and
I
still

is
that

a
real
indictment
of

if

I
contacted
Parts
Gateway
because
I
needed
several
secondhand
parts
for
an
old
but
still
running
Rover
45.
Within
48
hours
of
posting
my
needs
on
the
site,
I
received
half
a
dozen
quotes
for
the
part
from
breakers
up
and
down
the
UK.
I
chose
one
of
the
cheaper
quotes
and
received
the
relevant
part
within
another
48
hours.
The
service
was
simplicity
itself
and
I
really
appreciated
having
both
a
choice
of
potential
suppliers,
some
good
cheap
quotes
-
and
good
service
at
the
end
of
it.
They
cam
in
cheaper
than
anyone
else.
They
contacted
me
directly
when
I
asked
for
an
earlier
delivery
than
that
stated,
which
they
said
was
not
possible
-
and
then
delivered
on
the
original
day
requested.
How's
that
for
service?
Top
company.
Everything
from
the
web
service
to
logistics
works.
And
your
pre-,
during
and
post-tracking
is
very
reassuring.
Found
my
product
easily
and
the
price
was
as
good
as
I
found.

Even
better
than
Amazon
and
Amazon's
partners.

Hard
to
rate
since
I
have
not
received
my
order
yet
but
I'll
give
5
stars
anyway
since
this
is
the
best
price
I
could
find
on
Klipsch
S4
earbuds.
Your
website
could
do
with
a
face
lift,
but
it
didn't
effect

I
got
with
my
order
or
speed
in
which
I
received
it.
Very
satisfied.
Very
good
and
deliver
on
what
they
say
I
received
my
purchase
the
next
day.

I
was
glad
I
did,
it
was
understandable
that
they
would
take
a
few
weeks
to
get
to
me,
but
SelectSpecs
was
very
professional
and
gave
an
accurate
timeline
for
when
my
glasses
would
be
ready!

Once
I
got
the
shipping
notification,
they
arrived

within
a
week.

I
am
very
satisfied
with
the
purchase
and
I
would
recommend
SelectSpecs
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
brand
at
a
fraction

that
no
company
even
came
close
to
the
price
and
expertise
of
Home

They
worked
with

to
get
the
right
size
for
our
budget.
They
helped
us
get

to
upgrade
the

CDS
brought
the

over,
set
it
in

ran

installed

It
has
come

Dealing

expect
an

to
be
dewarer
than
the

will
always
check
before
i
make
another
purchase.

The
sales
representative
was
an
outstanding
representative
of
Swiss
Army
Products.

He
was
helpful,
well
spoken,
polite,
and
knowledgeable.

I
received
my
first
SA
knife
65
years
ago
and
had
lost
a
small
tool
fitting
in
the
handle.

Not
only
did
the
sales
representative
help
me
with
my
knife
selection
for
my
grandson,
he
mailed
me
the
small
tool
perfectly
fitting
my
65
year
old
SA
knife
my
Father
gave
me
on
my
10th
birthday.

He
is
certainly
a
valuable
asset
for
Swiss
Army
Products.

Priceline.com
provides

I
would
like
priceline.com
to
allow
a
bid
on
a
hotel
to
be
changeable
solely
by
changing
the
price
and
not
as
they
have
it
set
up
now,
which
requires
changing
the
price
and
star
rating
when
one
re-bids
after
one's
initial
bid
is
rejected.
This
is
to
say
that
priceline
requires
the
bidder
to
bid
the
same
amount
for
a
lower-starred
hotel
as
they
had
just
bid
for
a
higher-starred
hotel.
I
was
pleased
with
the
part
and
it's
performance.
The
selection
was
great
and
pricing
was
fair,
some
less
than
desirable
weather
slowed
the
shipping
down
but
it
still
arrived
within
the
estimated
time.
Will
be
buying
from
here
again.
Our
plane
was
delayed
in
Raleigh,
NC.
We
had
a
party
of
two
departing
from
a
different
location
(Sitka,
AK)

who
arrived
on
time,
(grandchildren)
who
notified
the
agents
that
our
plane
had
had
been
held
up
do
to
a
fuel
leak
and
had
to
wait
for
parts
to
be
flown
in
and
that
we
would
be
arriving
the
following
morning.
Upon
our
arrival
the
agent
behind
the
desk
said
they
had
no
conversation
with
anyone
and
since
we
were
late
our
car
had
been
put
back
in
the
rental
pool
and
that
they
had
no
other
autos
at
the
rate
we
had
been
quoted
and
paid
months
earlier.
The
agent
assisting
us
was
extremely
rude
and
said
they
would
agree
to
upgrade
us
and
put
the
monies
paid
toward
said
upgrade
which
was
the
only
price
range
vehicle
they
had
available
at
this
late
date.
Cost
to
us
was
an
additional
$800.00
on
top
of
the
$480.00
already
paid.
Obviously
we
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
since
we
were
Americans
traveling
to
the
UK.
We
feel
the
agents
were
lacking
in
understanding
with
schedules
by
our
airlines
and
we
feel
we
were
taken
advantage
of
"big
time!"
Checking
todays
rentals
from
this
company
both
the
original
auto
we
rented
and
the
supposed
upgrade
are
going
at
the
same
weekly
rate.
We
will
not
be
doing
business
with
them
again!!
I

I
bought
a
Samsung
Galaxy
3
7
inch
Tablet
for
$150
and
the
extended
2
year
protection
plan
of
$50
more
from
TigerDirect
a
few
months
back.

I
broke
the
screen
and
took
it
back
to
the
store
for
repair
and
I
was
told
by
the
store
that
I
needed
to
call
the
warranty
company
and
send
the
unit
back.

The
warranty
company
is
called
Square
Trade
and
the
person
I
talked
to
was
in
Pakistan.

The
person
I
talked
to
said
his
name
was
Ryan
(That
was
with
a
Heavy
Accent),
He
told
me
that
the
tablet
could
not
be
fixed
and
they
were
sending
me
my
money
back
$150
for
what
I
paid
for
the
tablet
once
they
had
received

the
tablet.

I
asked
why
they
couldn’t
fix
it
and
he
said
that
it
would
cost
more
to
repair
it
than
what
it
cost.

Then
He
said
that
if
it
had
cost
$125
to
fix
it
then
my
warranty
would
only
have
$25
left
for
future
repairs.
I
asked
to
talk
to
his
supervisor
and
he
said
there
were
4
of
them
but
they
were
with
clients
and
it
would
take
3
hours
for
me
to
get
a
response
from
them.
I
asked
for
one
of
the
names
of
the
supervisor
and
he
gave
me
the
name
Sylvia
(remember
this
is
a
call
center
in
Pakistan.

I
gave
up
dealing
with
them
and
sent
the
tablet
back.
I
have
also
been
receiving
a
lot
of
junk
mail
since
I
gave
the
rep
my
email
address.
They
did
send
me
a
check
for

I
went
to

If
anything,
their

TFT
in
Seekonk,
MA
did
their
best
to
work
with
my
finances
while
providing
a
tire
that
was
comparable
to
what
I
was
originally
looking
for.

They
were
courteous
and
completed
the
work
within
the
time
frame
they
quoted
me.

I
would
definitely
recommend
them!
They
have
a
good
range
of
products
and
lots
of
information
about
sizing.
Very
good
with
delivery.
This
is
only
second
time
of
using
Boiler
Juice,
however,
they
have
given
me
a
great
price.

They
did
NOT
contact
me,
before
delivery,
i
just
had
a
card
through
my
front
door
saying
they
had
been?


However,
this
was
a
lot
sooner
than
they
had
first
estimated.

Also,
i
am
now
waiting
for
the
service
engineer,
they
advertise
on
their
web
site
to
visit.

I
sent
an
email,
and
got
a
phone
call
the
very
next
day.

Prices
quoted
are
far
lower
than
anyone
in
the
area.
Its
worth
checking
out
for
boiler
services
and
faults.
We
have
now
used
the
service
engineer.

that
I
ordered

cabin

for
a

Ford
Taurus
and
was
with
PartsGeek
I
ordered
and
received
without
any

came
in

and

I
was

My
5
year
old
PC
packed
in....I
was
gutted!
After
briefly
considering
repairs/
upgrades,
it
was
obvious
that
a
new
PC
was
needed.
I've
had
my
Dino
PC
for
a
few
months
now,
so
have
had
enough
time
to
give
it
a
good
run
in
and
offer
a
fair
review..
The
best
place
to
shop,
a
neighborhood
store,
disguised
as
a
superstore.
Always
friendly,
always
helpful
and
great
prices.
I
never
received
the
card
I
ordered.
You
indicated
that
it
had
shipped
but
you
promised
a
'shipped'
email
which
was
not
received
either.
I
can
only
assume
it
hadn't
shipped
in
the
first
place.
I
rate
you
ZERO!!
Excellent
web
site,
and
excellent
in-store
service.
Fast
delivery,
Parts
in
great
condition,
Good
service.
Lots
of
option
with
speedy
dispatch
what
more
can
you
ask
for?
Have
I
ever
had
a
better
service
from
a
web
store?
No,
never
and
I
have
shopped
on
the
web
for
some
time.
The
website
is
well
laid
out
and
the
prices
are
good.


I
will
shop
here
again.
I
was
VERY
impressed
with
how
well
my
ordered
was
packaged
by
Prime
Pet
Supply.

This
has
NOT
been
the
case
with
Petflow
or
Chewy.

Now,
if
you
would
start
carrying
my
litter...
Having
booked
a
mobile
tyre
fitting,
I
was
very
dispappointed
that
the
8:30am
to
5:30pm
slot
was
not
adhere
to.
When
I
called
at
5:30,
I
was
told
it
had
been
booked
for
Thursday,
not
Tuesday.
This
was
strange
as
I
had
printed
confirmation
in
my
hand
and
had
confirmed
details
in
the
telephone
the
day
before.

Staff
were
polite,
apologetic
and
arranged
for
the
fitting
the
following
day.
Received
what
I
needed
in
a
timely
fashion
Great
service
and
value.
Would
recommend
to
all!
B&H's
service
and
selection
is
unmatched.
I
cannot
recommend
them
highly
enough.
Great
Company,
Great
Service,
Tops
Them
All
They
are
very
helpful,
make
ordering
products
uncomplicated
and
my
number
one
reason
is…I
trust
them!
I
found
Cash
for
Books
several
months
ago
to
sell
my
books
back
for
the
most
money.

Not
only
do
they
pay
top
dollar,
but
the
fact
they
offer
a
free
shipping
label,
but
still
pay
you
for
your
book.

The
Customer
Service
folks
are
very
helpful
and
friendly.

Please
consider
Cash
for
Books.
Good
website,
easy
to
use.
One
previous
use
of
customer
service
was
really
good
with
helpful
and
courteous
employee.
Product
is
good
in
style
and
quality
for
price.
I
was
much
pleased
to
discover
Cult
Pens
whilst
searching
the
net
for
Tombow
pens,
which
i
had
used
a
few
years
ago
until
they
were
lost
as
is
the
nature
of
pens.
Very
prompt
service
I
am
new
to
using
TriChlor
tablets
and

Doheny's
video
helped
to
answer
some
questions
I
had
regarding
it's
use.

I
have
been
happy
with
products
ordered
previously


and
this
one
was
no
exception.

Doheny's
had
the
lowest
price
on
the
web
for
TriChlor
and
it
arrived
in
just
2
days!


Reliable
service,
fast
shipping
and
lowest
prices,
what
more
could
one
ask
for?
eTyres
offer
a
fast
easy
to
use
website
and
then
follow
this
up
with
a
reliable
and
friendly
service.
I've
used
them
a
few
times
and
never
had
a
problem.
The
best
bit
for
me
is
that
I
don't
need
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
a
fitting
station
as
they
come
to
you.
Their
pricing
is
just
as
competitive
as
everyone
else
too,
so
the
mobile
fitting
is
effectively
a
'free'
service.
I've
had
a
few
canvases
from
these

Their
attention
to
detail
is
spot
on.
I
totally
appreciate

Very

Website

well

and
laid
out.

Couldn't

But
the
selection,
payment,
delivery,
etc.
all
went
exactly
as
I
expect
them
to.

Got

Price
was
less

half
of

in
two

I've
seen.
product

delivered
promptly
and
in
perfect

and
at
a
good

always
check
out
the

First
time
I
have
used
this
company
and
judging
by
their
performance
this
time
they
will
now
become
by
Dive
gear
supplier
of
choice.
I've
had
several
orders
recently,
all
arrived
as
promised,
all
arrived
undamaged,
nothing
missing.
Priceline
is
very
accommodating
and
excellent
experience
for
any
looking
to
get
a
great

with
traveling.
When
ever
traveling
remember
to
book
at
least
two
in
advance
to
get
the
best

I
will
continue
to
use

because
I
have
great
experiences.
Great
website
and
easy
to
use.
Product
was
well
packaged
and
delivered
quickly.
Definetly
use
this
company
again.
Just
bought
the
Force
Ten
tent
and
mid
layer
top.
Both
at
very
competitive
prices.
The
staff
were
very
friendly
and
the
goods
arrived
in
good
time,
recorded
delivery.
First
class
shop.
Recommended
to
friends
and
will
definitely
use
again.
Thank
you
i
would
recommend
you
get
in
touch
with
shower
doctor
for
any
problems
with
your
shower.
they
always
strive
to
help
Service
was
good.
Product
was
bad
so
it
going
to
cost
me
$200
to
have
new
parts
installed,
and
you
guys
are
charging
me
$11
return
charge.
What's
up
with
that?
Both
my
orders
arrived
quickly.
The
items
are
top
quality.
I
have
no
problem
with
the
customer
service
I
received.

I
do
have
a
problem
with
the
products.

The
stuffed
animal
was
way
too
small.

By
going
from
the
picture
and
description
I
was
expecting
a
medium
size
toy.

What
I
received
is
not
even
big
enough
for
a
baby
chihuahua.

I
will
never
be
buying
toys
from
pet
flow
again.

I
make
minimum
wage
and
can
not
throw
away
$10.

I
will
stick
to
buying
them
in
stores
where
I
can
see
what
I
am
getting.

By
the
way
the
toy
was
a
raccoon.

As
far
as
the
Hungry
Dog
treats
go,
again
I
was
sadly
disappointed.

I
bought
2
bags.

And
in
each
bag
I
only
received
a
"variety"
of
2
different
kinds
of
treats.

I
could
see
that
in
one
bag
there
might
have
been
a
mistake
but
in
both?

I
have
been
buying
these
for
about
4
or
5
years
and
never
have
I
received
only
2
different
kinds
in
a
bag.

Normally
I
would
get
5
or
6
different
kinds.

I
do
not
believe
that
Petflow
is
responsible,
but
Merrick
the
maker,
but
Petflow
should
still
be
held
somewhat
accountable
as
they
should
inspect
for
quality.

If
the
place
I
used
to
buy
these
from
did
not
go
out
of
business
I
would
continue
to
buy
from
there
as
they
only
charged
$9.99
a
bag
and
no
shipping.

I
am
still
up
in
the
air
as
to
whether
I
will
continue
to
purchase.

If
I
only
wanted
one
or
2
kinds
treats
I
would
have
just
bought
those
in
bulk.

I
expected
a
variety
and
did
not
get
it.
We
depend
on
Trip
advisor
for
honest
unbiased
information
when
we're
planning
a
trip,
or
just
finding
someplace
to
eat
in
a
new
area.
Like
anyone
else,
you
feel
much
better
about
trying
someplace
that
other
have
enjoyed,
or
finding
out
that
interesting
looking
restaurant
really
has
terrible
food,
so
you
don't
waste
an
evening.
I
try
to
rate
the
places
we
really
enjoy
so
others
can
discover
them
and
keep
them
thriving.
I
had
to
return
a
tire
for
warranty
and
had
no
problems.
A
new
tire
was
sent
and
a
pre-paid
return
label
to
send
the
defective
tire
back
was
included.
I
am
very
pleased
with
your
service
and
recomendation.
Of
the
product.
You
advised
upon
,ps,
just
thing
could
you
send
me
a
receipt
for
this
please
,
once
again
thanks
I
will
recommend
you
to

,regards
b.wriggy!
I
have
used
GAK
a
few
times
over
the
last
few
years,
great
service,
great
knowledge
of
products,
very
friendly
and
helpful.

If
it
wasn't
for
the
fact
I
have
contacts
at
retailers
near
me
I
would
use
them
all
the
time.
Great
selection
of
products
and
if
you
need
advice
it
is
readily
available
by
phone.
Competitiove

I
found
Music
Magpie
to
be
fast
and
very
efficient.

They
continually
kept
me
updated
at
every
stage
of
the
process
and
I
was
happy
with
everything
from
the
moment
I
registered
to
the
point
of
payment.

I
would
certainly
use
Music
Magpie
again
and
I
would
recommend
my
friends
and
family
to
do
likewise.
Having
only
used
Music
Magpie
to
declutter
my
CDs
I
am
confident
that
other
facets
of
the
service
would
be
equally
as
efficient
and
freindly.
I
always
look
at
B&H
before
I
buy
any
camera/computer
related
product.

Most
of
the
time
their
prices
are
a
little
lower
than
anyone
else.

And
in
the
case
today,
I
got
free
shipping.

That's
always
a
good
thing
I
received
my
part
fast
and
it
worked
like
a
charm.

Partsgeek.com
is
very
convenient
and
saved
me
lots
of
money.

I
definitely
recommend
them.

Everything
was
perfect.
I
have
been
buying
more
and
more
of
our
technology
needs
from
B&H
over
the
past
year.
B&H
is
price
competitive,
some
times
the
lowest.
They
ship
my
stuff
fast
from
NY
which
is
great
for
me
on
the
East
Coast.
I
get
it
in
a
day.
I
had
occasion
to
return
a
defective
unit
and
so
far
it
seems
like
the
process
is
awesome.
You
should
try
them
if
you
normally
shop
one
of
the
other
online
electronics
stores.
I
have
been
purchasing
photography
equipment
from
B
&
H
Photo
for
over
15
years
now
and
i
never
had
a
problem!!!!
Thank
You
B
&
H
!!!
I
had
my
reservations
about
ordering
from
PetFlow,
as
I
had
never
heard
of
the
company.

I
decided
to
try
an
order
for
both
my
dog
and
cat
by
ordering
a
couple
of
samples.

The
sample
arrived
for
the
cat,
but
not
for
the
dog.

I
contacted
the
customer
service
department
and
they
let
me
know
that
the
samples
for
dogs
were
no
longer
available.

Not
only
did
they
refund
the
price
for
the
sample,
but
the
shipping
cost
for
the
ENTIRE
order.

I
didn't
even
have
to
ask
for
the
refund.

Needless
to
say,
I'm
going
to
order
more
from
PetFlow
in
the
future!

Thank
you
for
the
great
service!
they
sent
the
wrong
part,I
paid
postage
to
send
it
back,
I
thought
they
would
send
the
right
part


they
credited
my
card
and
charged
me
15%
restock
fee
and
they
don't
answer
their
phone
don't
do
business
with
anyone
you
can't
talk
to

do
this
first
before
doing
business
with
anyone
The
photo
book
was
better
than
expected
and
an
excellent
18th
Birthday
present
for
my
granddaughter.
Ordering,
confirmation,
appointment
and
fitting
all
carried
out
as
you
would
expect
from
such
a
professional
organisation!
There
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
about
customer
service.
When
you
can't
get
a
hold
of
anyone
after
numerous
attempts
and

ridiculous
hold
times,
then
you
have
a
problem.
I
liked
the
tune
on
hold,
but
after
1
hour
and
50
minutes,
your
ready
to
pull
your
hair
out.
I
needed
someone
"human".
I
got
nothing.
As
I
foraged
through
the
site,
I
found
what
I
thought
I
needed
and
purchased
it.
Unfortunately,
it
was
only
a
portion
of
what
was
necessary
to
fix
my
truck
and
could
not
be
utilized.
The
shipping
took
much
longer
then
it
should
have.
I
am
on
the
east
coast,
and
the
part
came
out
of
a
warehouse
on
the
west
coast.
Very
disappointing.
On
top
of
every
thing
else,
I
am
out
$105,
since
i
believe
their
is
a
no
return
policy.
Not
a
good
experience.
Knowledgeable
people
on
the
other
side
could
have
made
a
world
of
difference.
Easy
to
use
website,
good
price,
fast
delivery.
Can't
ask
for
more.
Bought
several
small
items
arrived
next
day
would
definitely
buy
more
stuff
from
them
Good
trustworthy
company
will
make
business
with
them
again.
Bought
several
times
in
the
past
always
an
easy
transaction
and
low
prices
Fast
shipping
good
price
excellent
overall
experience,
definitely
will
order
from
them
in
the
future,
very
pleased.
Couldn't
be
happier.
Very
easy
and
extremely
quick.
Especially
good
for
an
early
flight
.
Friendly
staff.
Paid
half
of
the
offer
from
Avis,
Hertz
etc.
with
the
same
service
level
from
the
smaller
local
rental
company
at
Split
Airport,
Croatia.
My
only
remark
is
that
I
received
no
answer
from
support@vipcars.com
when
I
tried
to
upgrade
to
a
bigger
car
some
time
before
my
arrival
at
Split.
The
part
came
quick
and
was
just
what
I
was
looking
for.
Great
prices
and
fast
shipping
Please
dont
use
this
company,
its
a
con.
They
sent
me
a
battery
that
didn't
even
fit
my
Laptop.
It
had
been
opened
and
looked
used.
Very
small
bunch
of
wilted
unopened
flowers
which
earned
me
about
10
quids
worth
of
appreciation
from
my
girlfriend,
rather
than
the
32
pounds
worth,
that
Id
hoped
for.
After
spending
thousands
of
pounds
at
MP
over
the
years,
Ive
went
over
to
Bulk
powders,
who
I
whole
heatedly
recommend
to
everyone
I
placed
my
first
order
with
SelectSpecs.Com
on
the
22nd
of
December
2012
for
some
rimless
gent's
glasses,
I
wasn't
expecting
delivery
until
at
least
mid
January
2013,
but
to
my
great
surprise
my
order
was
delivered
within
7
working
days,
excluding
the
Christmas
holidays.
Running
my
own
business
makes
me
acutely
aware
of
how
important
customer
service
is,
so
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
witness
the
speed
and
efficiency
with
which
my
order
was
dispatched,
especially
over
the
Christmas
period
when
I
fully
expected
a
delay.

The
product
was
superb,
and
when
compared
to
a
well
known
high
street
franchise
who
sells
rimless
glasses
at
£169,
I
definitely
received
a
bargain,
having
only
paid
£52
to
SelectSpecs.Com
which
included
delivery
plus
one
additional
accoutrement.
I
wasn't
looking
for
the
cheapest
price
when
buying
glasses,
but
I
also
didn't
want
to
feel
that
I
was
paying
for
the
overheads
(and
in
some
cases
franchise
costs)

within
the
purchase
price
of
the
product.

SelectSpecs.Com
gave
me
a
reasonable
price,
a
superb
service
and
an
excellent
product
-
what
more
could
I
ask
for?
If
everyone
operated
as
efficiently
as
they
do
there'd
be
a
massive
increase
in
highly
satisfied
customers.
People
are
usually
quicker
to
criticise
than
praise,
however
I
adhere
to
the
principle
of
'praise
where
praise
is
due'
-
and
in
this
case
it's
richly
deserved.
Every
order
up
to
this
point
has
been
precise,
and
very
timely.
Could
not
ask
for
better
service.
I
always
buy
from
B
and
H.

Their
products
are
fairly
priced,
their
shipping
is
fast
and
they
can
be
relied
on
from
start
to
finish.
I
received
an
awning
and
it
was
damaged.

Didn't
know
this
until
I
opened
the
box
days
later.

I
called
American
RV
and
they
shipped
another
one
out
right
away.

Considering
how
large
the
item
is
it
was
no
small
feat,
and
they
made
it
happen
in
the
time
frame
I
needed.
The
PC
I
bought
was
excellent
value
compared
to
other
sites
and
arrived
in
the
timescale
quoted.
Jeg
bliver
lidt
ked
af
det,
når
jeg

I
was
trying
to
replace
my
coolant
resevoir
tank
at
all
the
local
auto
stores
and
was
quoted
169.00
plus
tax
and
the
funniest
part
about
it
was
that
they
had
to
special
order
it..!

I
went
online
and
ordered
it
from
partsgeek.com
myself....installed
it...
filled
my
gas
tank
up...
and
went
out
for
dinner
and
did
not
spend
169.00
total...Thank
you
partsgeek
for
dinner
and
gas...!!
They
shipped
out
my
screen
the
day
I
ordered
it.
When
I
receivied
it
I
found
it
was
the
wrong
one,
which
rarely
happens
with
Screen
Country
orders.
I
called
to
get
an
RMA
for
the
return
and
reorder
the
correct
screen
and
they
apologized
and
shipped
the
correct
screen
out
the
same
day,
overnight
delivery.
I
had
the
replacement
screen
in
my
hands
first
thing
the
next
morning.
They
are
a
great
company
to
do
business
with
and
their
products
are
excellent.
Spectacular
products,
at
rock
bottom
prices
plus
you
get
all
the
goodies
wow,
awesome
deal!!!

Bought

My

went

I
recommend
using
there
service.
Ordered
brake
parts
for
my
BMW
and
found
the
best

anywhere
and
the
service
was
excellent.
Shipping
is
also
free
on
most
things
so
you
can't
go
wrong.
Well,
going
by
the
online
reviews,
this
company
rocks.
However,
the
real-life
experience
was
more
like
having
rocks
dropped
on
me.
For
the
first
time,
without
paying
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
it)
I
have
good
clear
phone
service
over
the
internet
at
a
reasonable
price.

I
love
it,
and
I
depend
on
it.

Thanks
Phone
Power.
My
order
was
delivered
on
time
as
promised,
the
shoes
were
a
size
too
large
but
the
phone
service
was
excellent,
a
return
note
was
emailed
to
me
immediately,
I
returned
them
(
I
paid
the
postage
'cos
it
was
my
fault
)

and
had
a
full
refund
in
a
couple
of
days,
reordered
the
correct
size
this
time
and
they
were
delivered
promptly,
this
time
all
is
well.
Highly
recommended.
The
driver
was
friendly
and
delivered
our
oil
quickly.

Was
pleasant
despite
someone
beeping
their
car
horn
at
him
(the
delivery
blocks
the
road
as
we
live
on
a
narrow
rural
road).

Great
all
around!
I
will
not
use
or
recommend
Eurocar!
In
fact
I
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
discourage
friends
and
clients
fro
using
Eurocar.

I
was
charged
for
the
full
amount
of
my
order
and
two
days
later
without
no
explanation
or
apology
they
sent
me
the
invoice
for
two
thirds
of
what
I
had
bought
and
told
me
that
I
will
be
refunded
for
the
rest.
This
was
my
first
order
of
contact
lenses
online
and
I'll
continue
to
order
from
lenstore
as
I'm
happy
with
the
range
of
products
and
their
overall
service.
I've
purchased
warranties
throughout
my
life,
an
odd
thing
I
tell
you
since
I
really
treat
myself
in
a
devil
may
care
way,
I
run
marathons,
I
hike
mountains,
I
eat
whole
cheese
cakes
and
I
train
martial
arts
and
get
my
body
and
feathers
ruffled
on
a
day
to
day
occurrence.
So,
when
I
bought
a
Canon
G10
years
ago,
and
used
it
on
a
trip,
I
also
purchased
a
Squaretrade
warranty
along
with
it.
The
warranty
sat,
unused
for
years.
Two
and
a
half
to
be
exact,
so
I
got
that
familiar
feeling
anyone
gets
when
they
get
the
clear
coat
put
on
their
car,
or
the
cabbage
they
bought
that
spoiled,
that
feeling
of,
unused
service.
Which
was
fine,
I
went
on
thinking
ignorance
was
bliss
and
never
sure
if
I
would
ever
need
Squaretrade
for
future
purchases,
as
I
seemed
to
take
care
of
my
things.
And
then,
while
hiking
around
Arizona
on
a
cross
country
drive,
the
wind
decided
to
be
my
nemesis
and
knock
my
tripod
mounted
camera
forwards
and
into
a
rock
filled
path
of
discomfort.
The
camera
build
like
the
8
bit
Nintendo
survived
the
scuffle
with
gravity
but
not
completely
unphased,
a
slight
scratch
had
found
it's
way
onto
my
lens,
visible
in
photo's.
I
finished
my
cross
country
trek,
contacted
squaretrade
through
a
few
clicks
and
presto,
box
in
the
mail
and
a
few
days
later
my
camera
were
being
repaired.
I
know
such,
as
I
got
emails
updating
me
on
it's
status.
Then
it
arrived
back,
and
my
lens
was
fixed
and
my
life
were
better
and
I
have
bought
a
warranty
through
squaretrade
on
everything
I
buy.
Everything,
camera
lens
and
such
from
ebay,
keyboards
from
amazon.
I
hardly
ever
use
the
warranties,
currently
I
have
9
and
have
only
required
their
service
3
times.
Another
fight
with
gravity
and
my
phone,
and
my
kindle
deciding
it
didn't
want
to
be
a
e-reader
and
instead
opted
for
paper
weight.
good
quality
goods
at
the
right
price
+
prompt
service
Have
used
this
site
on
previous
occasions.
Definitely
love
the
price
match
option.
Prices
are
among,
if
not
the
lowest,
on
the
internet.

For
an
athlete,
Supplementwarehouse.com
is
a
big
advantage
for
purchasing
in
bulk.

They
ship
very
quick
and
I
love
the
amount
of
free
merchandise
available.

I
do
not
find
the
high
shipping
prices
to
be
a
disadvantage;
when
ordering
a
lot,
high
shipping
should
be
expected.
Will
definitely
be
using
this
site
more
often
to
fit
my
needs.

This

If
the

the
exceptionally

is

I
was
looking

I
ordered
the
pedals
on
Monday,
and
they

in

by
the
following

which
was
fantastic
for

Excellent

Will

The

Liked
this

for
the
different

and
also
the
parts
that
were
available
for

an
also
for
other

Would

I
ORDERED
THAT

HAD

THAN
A

ONLY

WITH

I
decided
to
fit
my

with
a
series
of
plastic
rack.
I
found
what
I
wanted
on
Bernards
Bins'
web
site
so
I
ordered
it.
Delivery
was
later
than
promised
but
considering
the
appauling
state
of
the
weather
I
was
well
satisfied.
Received
my
spyderco

in
less
than
24
hours
of

Lovely

Just
ordered
another

Once

Will

5
stars
all
the
way!
very
fast
service.
Always
have
quality
components...
Would
definitely
recommend
this
company.

I
looked
at
some
frames
that
I
really
liked
at
my
OD
but
thought
they
were
rather

pricey.

I
found
the
same
frames
on
Frames
Direct
at
a
significant
discount.
I
received
the
glasses
about
3
weeks
later
(they
were
on
back
order).

Very
pleased
with
my
new
frames
and
the
FD
lab
did
a
great
job
on
the
prescription
lenses!
Can't
remember
the
chap's
name
after
all
this
time
but
he
was
brilliant.

He
was
really
careful
with
moving
the
piece
of
furniture
and
padded
it
up
fully
for
transport.

He
also
took
a
massive
share
of
the
heavy
lifting.

Really
excellent.
After
getting
advice
from
the
nurse
at
our
doctor's
surgery,
we
were
advised
not
to
take
the
prescription
straight
to
the
chemist
downstairs
but
to
shop
around
a
bit.

This
was
wise
advice
as
we
needed
39
days'
worth
of
Malarone.

Since
they
are
charged
'per
tablet',
savings
can
be
significant.

Travelpharm
was
easily
the
best
value
we
found
and
delivery
was
very
quick
after
we
posted
the
prescription
to
them.
Love
this
site,
love
the
selection,
their
prices
are
always
great
but
I
do
believe
they
make
up
for
their
prices
with
shipping.
It
usually
takes
at
least
5
days
to
ship
to
me
down
here
in
Texas
and
the
shipping
is
never
less
than
$11.
Something
about
that
doesn't
add
up...
Would
be
5
stars
if
shipping
were
either
quicker
and
$11
or
cheaper
and
as
slow.
Always
buy
my
games
here,
great
service
very
fast
has
a
nice
reward
scheme
for
loyal
customers,
online
support
which
has
helped
me
in
the
past,
a
really
good
online
store,
I
never
use
anyone
else.
The
best
price.
Fast
delivery.
Enough
said
I
Bought
a
Maxpedition
Fliergerduffel
bag
I
Have
shopped
at
this
company
for
many
years.
Excellent
service,
delivery,
parts,
and
quality.
Order
and
it
arrives
in
3
days
at
the
most
from
the
UK
pretty
awesome,
wish
I
had
a
store
near
by
to
try
clothes
on
be
for
buying
though.
This
site
is
cheap
and
has
a
fast
delivery.
It's
pretty
much
the
reason
I
don't
buy
in
the
retail
shops
anymore.
I
had
read
some
reports
that
the
Mavic
shoes
came
up
fairly
large
and
being
a
size
12.5
this
was
good
news
to
me.
I
usually
buy
size
13
bike
shoes
and
have
used
specialized
for
some
time
now.
A
call
to
Jamie
at
the
shop
and
some
sound
advice
that
sizing
on
the
Mavic
was
similar
to
the
spesh
shoes,
so
I
bought
the
size
13's
(they
were
in
stock
too!!)
and
they
are
spot
on,
great
combination
of
stiffness
and
comfort,
great
looking
shoe,
very
happy.
I
just
hope
the
shiny
finish
stands
the
test
of
time.
They've
got
what
you
need
most
of
the
time
and
there
aren't
many
people
who
can
beat
them
on
price.
They
don't
stock
some
of
the
Top
end
brands
that
I
like
personally
but
they
can't
stock
everything
I
suppose.
Overall
very
happy
with
the
service
I
get
from
them,
delivery
is
quick
but
sometimes
parts
that
are
out
of
stock
can
take
a
while
to
appear
in
stock
again
so
I
end
up
looking
elsewhere.
I
found
this
site
with
really
great
prices
tools,
couldn't
resist
and
ordered
a
few
and
they
ce
really
fast.
Well
pleased.
I
bought
some
Schwalbe
Nobby
Nics,
Merlin
are
always
very
competitive
on
price.
The
description
is
always
very
clear
making
choice
easy.
The
payment
system
is
smooth
and
delivery
is
super
quick,
I've
never
experienced
delays.

Overall
a
superb
service
and
would
recommend
to
anyone.
I
paid
a
lot
of
money
for
what
I
was
expecting
would
be
a
quality
suit,
and
received
a
very
poorly
fit
suit
of
cheap
material.
Ok
so
heres
the
deal,
i
live
in
cairns
Qld
Australia,
and
needed
to
buy
a
heap
of
diving
stuff!
so
i
found
this
little
gem
of
a
website!
My
1st
order
a
reg
bag,
ordered
on
the
18th
of
may,
got
it
the
28th
now
in
my
books
thats
amazing
seeing
as
i
live
over
10,000ks
away!
ordered
a
few
other
things
the
next
week,
then
had
an
email
saying
delayed,
emailed
deep
blue
dive
tro
see
what
was
going
on,
got
an
answer
within
hours
explaining
what
was
going
on!
I
have
no
hesitations
in
using
these
use
again
and
again
as
its
amazingly
cheap,
fast
and
easy
to
deal
with
these
guys!
I
really
have
never
had
such
good
servise!
They
have
a
excellent
customer
service
and
fast
shipping
great
of
selection
and
most
of
my
purchases
is
based
in
their
products
review
Videos
they
give
confidence
what
to
buy
and
their
return
policy
is
excellent
I
bought
a
Alpinestars
suit
and
they
help
me
out
to
get
it
perfect
size
very
knowledge
staff.
I
wish
I
would
have
found
these
guys
sooner!
My
24kg
kettelbell
purchase
was
simple
and
smooth.
It
arrived
in
solid
packaging,
on
time.
The
website
is
simple
to
use
and
gives
you
the
information
you
need
regarding
the
products.
..waiting
for
15-30
minutes
while
other
company
has
multiple
cars
going
by
is
ridiculous!
Especially
when
my
flight
itself
was
1.5hrs.
SO
far
every
order
i
have
made
with
Parts
Geek
has
been
very
quickly
shipped
even
at
cheapest
shipping
option.

Great
prices.
Site
is
easy
to
find
and
order
from
and
my
order
is
always
correct
and
well
packaged.

I
use
them
for
all
my
spa
supplies.
This
site
has
great
prices,
shipping
rates,
and
customer
service!
I
highly
recommend
it.
Good
choice
of
products,
easy
order
and
quick
delivery
-
usually
10-14
days,
but
the
package
arrived
in
6
days
from
order
(from
UK
to
Slovakia).
I
ordered
the
HUNTER
instant
boot
shine
and
HUNTER
boot
buffer.
The
bad
experience
was
that
all
goods
including
the
invoice
were
dirty
and
greasy
from
the
product.
And
the
stickers
on
the
products
were
damaged.
I
ordered
the
goods
as
gift,
so
this
was
quite
negative
to
find
out.
I
know
we
can
blame
the
mail
service
but
this
shouldn´t
happen.
short
and
sweet
!!

these
guys
know
what
they
are
doing
!!!!
I
go
to
Heinnie's
because
the
service
is
second
to
none,
the
best
I've
ever
had
from
any
other
firm
on
the
internet.
I've
bought
3
knives
and
a
sheath,
which
have
all
been
quality
goods.

Would
recommend
Heinni
to
any
one
without
any
qualms.
Great
firm
great
goods.
The
website
itself
is
fine.
Relay
good
contact
with
consultant
We
ordered
2
parts
and
the
invoice
indicated
that
they
were
both
shipped
via
Fed-EX
under
one
tracking
number
in
two
boxes.
Fed-Ex
arrived
with
just
one
box;
and
our
initial
reaction
was
that
the
Fed-Ex
guy
kept
our
other
package.
So
we
called
Fed-Ex
and
they
indicated
that
it
was
always
just
one
box
weighting
the
correct
amount
for
the
one
item
and
nothing
more.
We
then
tried
to
find
a
number
we
could
call
and
find
out
what
happened
to
the
other
part
that
now
showed
as
delivered,
when
it
wasn't.
That's
when
I
realized
there
was
no
customer
service
#
to
call,
so
I
googled
Parts
Geek
to
find
numerous
complaint
of
similar
incidents
and
the
people
never
receiving
their
item,
along
with
many
other
types
of
complaints.
At
this
point
we
thought,
we
have
been
ripped
off,
so
I
called
the
bank
to
stop
payment
for
the
item
I
did
not
receive
while
I
waited
for
an
email
reply
from
the
company
within
the
next
24-48
hours.
turns
out
the
other
part
was
on
it's
way
via
UPS
under
a
different
tracking
#,
now
I
have
to
call
the
bank
back
and
I
am
stuck
with
a
part
I
can
no
longer
use
for
we
had
to
buy
it
local
when
it
didn't
arrive
as
indicated
on
the
shipping
invoice.
Actually
found
it
local
for
less
and
had
it
in
minutes
versus
the
7-8
days
it
took
to
get
here.
All
because
their
shipping
invoice
was
incorrect
and
I
could
not
reach
a
live
person.
I
will
never
buy
from
them
again,
ever.
I
can
honestly
say
I
have
never
in
my
whole
life
dealt
with
a
better
company.

I
was
about
to
order
online
but
had
a
question
so
called
them
up
first.

The
call
was
immediately
answered
by
a
highly
knowledgeable
employee
who
stepped
me
through
what
memory
chips
I
needed.

I
placed
the
order
that
afternoon
and
the
next
day
the
package
arrived!

The
packaging
was
extremely
secure
and
the
chips
worked
perfectly.

If
only
every
company
operated
that
well.
Had
the
best
price
on
the
internet
by
at
least
20
bucks.
Shipped
quickly
and
was
exactly
as
advertised.
Will
patronize
again!
They
shipped
wrong
parts
and
sent
for
pickup
but
never
got
me
what
I
needed.

More
than
two
weeks,
still
no
part.

Ordered
from
somewhere
else.

Never
again.
My
first
time
with
Bookatrack
having
been
recommended
to
me
as
a
good
trackday
operator.
I've
only
had
one
late
delivery
from
them,
when
a
new
driver
got
lost.
Otherwise,
great
service.
Yodel
was
supposed
to
deliver
a
phone
to
me
then
apparently
"attempted"
delivery
without
leaving
a
calling
card.
I
rescheduled,
they
didn't
deliver
and
said
there
was
no
log
of
a
rescheduling.
This
continued
for
an
entire
week
before
they
admitted
they
didn't
know
where
my
parcel
was.
Appalling.
I
now
use
Cult
Pens
for
all
my
art
pen
needs
as
not
only
do
they
have
everything
I
need,
but
they
ship
my
order
off
straight
away
so
I
can
often
receive
my
pens
the
next
day
(or
two
days
if
I
ordered
in
the
afternoon).
Brilliant.
I
used
these
guys
to
purchase
some
Bose
QuietComfort
15.
They
were
cheaper
than
any
other
sites
out
there.
Although
they
were
initially
out
of
stock
I
had
a
phonecall
and
email
from
HiSpek
within
an
hour
of
ordering
letting
me
know
that
there
would
be
a
2
week
wait,
they
were
very
polite
and
helpful
and
gave
me
the
option
to
get
a
refund
or
wait.
I
waited
since
I
would

I

made
2
requests
into
customer
service
using
the
customer

option
on
the

Neither
one
has
generated
a
response.
The
1st
customer
service
request
was
to
verify
an
order.
Since
they
never
responded,
I
assumed
my
order
did
not
complete
correctly.
I
purchased
from
another
local
parts
store.
After
1
week,
I
received
my
original
order
from
Parts
Geek.
I
now
want
to
return
the
item.
My
2nd
customer
service
request
was
for
an
RMA
and
I
followed
the
instructions
on
the
portal.
I
have
yet
to

a

only

20

the

It
took
three
tries
to
book
a
multi
destination
flight.
On
my
first
attempt,
FlightHub
reported
that
the
price
had
increased
substantially
from
the
original
quote
and
gave
me
the
option
to
cancel.
I
was
skeptical,
but
cancelled
and
made
a
second
attempt
with
different
flights.
However,
when
tried
to
book
those,
I
was
informed
that
one
or
more
of
the
flights
were
no
longer
available.
Really
frustrated,
but
determined,
I
made
a
third
attempt
and
was
able
to
find
suitable
flights
and
actually
book
them.

worked
out

I've
bought
A
LOT
of
glasses
from
these
guys.

Generally
I
can
find
what
I
want
and
get
the
fit
right.

Prices
on
standard
glasses
are
probably
better
than
average.

Prices
on
progressives
tend
to
be
about
average,
but
generally
a
better
style
selection.

My
only
"complaint"
(which
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
quality)
is
that
as
a
repeat
customer
they
email
me
many
discount
offers
-
but
almost
always
on
standard
lenses
only
which
(a)
does
me
absolutely
no
good
and
(b)
they
should
know
better
-
I
have
not
ordered
any
standard
lenses
in
years.
Even
my
sunglasses
are
now
progressives.
Perfect
fast
and
received
package
rite
away.
The
service
was
great
value
for
money.

We
chose
to
pay
in

in
$AU
which
was
convenient
and
worked
well
for
us
with
exchange
rate.
We
knew
exactly
our
costs
in
advance.
Stressless!
Good
prices,
great
selection.
Site
is
easy
to

I
don't

I
do

always
on

competition.

ever

Great

well!
Cheap

The
actual
buildings
can
be
run
down
looking,
but
Aldi
has
got
it
where
it
counts.
Still
has
the
best
results,
but
their
new
privacy
policy
of
tracking
people
everywhere
they
go
on
the
web
is
a
little
too
Big
Brother.
Hopefully
someone
will
challenge
them
soon.
...and
never
contacted
me.
My
bank
had
to
notify
me,
which
was
not
a
fun
experience.
Could
have
ended
worse,
but
I
wish
Zappos
would
have
taken
this
hacking
issue
a
little
more
seriously.
When
people
describe
someone
else
as
"peaked"
just
think
of
how
popular
MySpace
was,
and
how
quickly
it
died
by
allowing
people
to
make
their
own
pages
look
like
crap.
Great
example
of
not
thinking
smart,
and
giving
people
everything
they
want
without
long
term
planning.

the
website
to
locate
the
correct
part
was
very
user
friendly,
and
the
purchase
of
the
part
was
easy.
I

curently
waiting
on
the

for
the

so
uinknown
how
easy
that

of
the

will
be.
Thank
you
for
the

of
this

I
received
an

and

for

Am
a
plumber
and
i
bought
the
thermostat
for
a
6
year
old
shower
valve
fitted
it
and
customer
feedback
was
"
i
can't
remember
it
ever
working
as
well
as
now.
Getting
a
replacement
thermostat
from
these
guys
saved
my
customer
£600
because
she
did
not
need
to
buy
a
whole
new
shower
valve.
Price
is
good
and
service
/
delivery
speedy..
No
problems
with
the
order,
arrived
as
it
should
have
as
have
other
orders
in
the
past.
Went
to
the
shop
to
see
if
they
had
the
make
and
model
in
stock,
they
had
the
right
model
in
a
different
colour
at
the
warehouse
which
they
got
in
for
me
to
try
later
on
in
the
day.
They
then
ordered
the
right
model
in
the
right
colour
and
it
arrived
on
the
day
they
said
it
would.
everything
was

I
ordered
a
tail

for

Nissan
titan
2006
and
it
fit
perfectly.

I
also
ordered
a
powered
mirror
assembly
for
a
1998
Honda
accord.

It
was
also
a
perfect
match
for
a
good
price.

I
looked
at
Argos,
Tesco
Direct
etc
websites
for
a
new
washing
machine
but
found
that
the
prices
for
machines
in
the
£200-£300
range
to
be
£30-£40
cheaper
at
Appliances
Online.

I
bought
a
Bosch
washing
machine
which
would
have
been
outside
of
my
budget
elsewhere.

Delivery
was
free
and
excellent
in
two
days,
with

and
even

If

go
to

There

are
reasonable
,
and
the

is
next

I
cannot
fault
that.
The
prices
are
cheaper
than
the

I
think
they
could
be
a

In

about

I
also
must
say
that
all

I
talked
with,

me.
And
for
that,
I
can
give
them
5

My
first
impression
was
the
packing
:
secure,
safe,
professional,
Good
prices.
Speedy
delivery.
No
mess
no

A
very

on
6/7,
a
Saturday.

I
did
not
expect
shipping
until
maybe
Tuesday
6/10,
for
the
"Next
Day
Shipping".

I
sent
a
message
on
6/11
Wednesday,

as
there
was
no
update
on
my
order
posted.

I
had
a
reply
that
night,
"Your
order
is
scheduled
to
ship
out
today,
sorry
for
the
slight
delay."

Really
shipped
6/13
Friday,
arrived
on
6/17
Tuesday.

10
days!

This
is
far
from
"Next

I
could
have
pick
up
the
items
local
for
just
a
few
dollars
more
and
had
it
on
the
day
I
ordered
from
Tuff
Supplies.

10

it

was

was

the

I
will
use
this

again
and
would

-
good
efficient
service
with
decent
prices.
Over
many
years
Axminster
has
been
the
exemplar
of
good
reliable
service
and
fair
prices.
My
recent
,fairly
expensive
,
transaction
has
fully
confirmed
my
opinion.A
minor
glitch
-
a
small
component
was
missing
from
the
manufacturers
packaging
-
was
dealt
with
speedily
and
very
generously
by
the
company.
The
price
and
value
of
the
deal
would
have
been
almost
impossible
to
match
elsewhere.
I
ordered
a
quite
expensive
power
tool
from
this
company
via
their
web
site
.
My
order
was
placed
at
about
2;30
pm
on
the
Monday
and
arrived
at
10:30
am
next
day
.This
sets
a
standard
which
,in
my
experience
,
few
other
companies
can
match.My
order
was
perfectly
packed
but
I
made
a
mistake
in
not
identifying
a
component
which
was
present
but
which
I
thought
was
missing
-
it
was
elsewhere
in
the
packaging.
This
potentially
embarrassing
mistake
on
my
part
was
dealt
with
efficiently
and
with
no
fuss
by
this
company's
phone
operative
.
Much
appreciated
!
It's
quite
remarkable
really,
but
the
item
was
ordered
at
a
weekend
and
delivered
on
a
Tuesday.
I
was
kept
informed
by
email
at
every
stage
and
on
the
Tuesday
morning
was
informed
as
to
the
hour
it
was
being
delivered.
It
came
within
the
first
minute
of
the
alloted
hour!
How
efficient
is
that
?
The
price
was
unbeatable
as
well
,
so
keep
up
the
good
work.
This
is
one
of
the
most
efficient
,
accurate
and
friendly
companies
that
I
have
had
dealings
with
-
thoroughly

recommended
.
San
Francisco
Herb
Company
has
always
sent
me
quality
products
in
a
very
timely
manner.

I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
wanting
herbs,
spices,
teas
or
any
other
of
the
product
that
they
supply.
I
never
respond
to
these
requests
for
feedback
but
want
to
in
this
case.
I
could
not
have
been
more
pleased.
My

and

I
am
sure
I
will
use
them
again
as
the
need
arises.
After
adding
the
initial
item
to
my
cart
that
I
was
going
to
purchase,
they
presented
such
a
huge
list
of
free
samples
and
discounted
items
on
the
cart
page
that
I
perused
it
for
about
a
half-hour.
Wow,
I
got
so
much
free
stuff:
protein
powders
and
bars,
energy
drinks,
etc.
The
shipping
was
a
little
high,
but
that's
pretty
normal
considering
the
weight
of
the
package
due
to
all
the
free
items
I
got.
Great
place!
I
had
all
5
tires
replaced
including
mounted,
balanced
and

My
Town
Fair
representative
was
most
helpful,
he
made
the
whole
process
simple,
got
me
in
and
out
with
ease
including
the
paperwork.
I
would
recommend
Town
Fair!
When
I
am
considering
purchasing
outdoor
equipment
I
always
refer
to
The
Outdoor
Shop.
Their
professionalism
towards
customers
and
their
range
of
products
is
often
second
to
none.
Also,
the
price
is
extremely
competitive
indeed.
Further
to
this,
it
is
rare
to
find
a
retail
shop
that
provides
an
exceptionally
effective
and
efficient
delivery
system
which
is
again
well
priced
and
particularly
important
considering
I
live
in
Scotland.
Enough

the
first
place
I
visit
when
ordering
my
games
online.
I
know
without
any
doubt
that
they
will
always
deliver
a
great
service
and
have
my
game
on
my
doormat
on
the
day
of
release.
Fast
delivery,
quality
products
and
save
a
bomb
as
I
ordered
the
bundle
deal.
Interface
is
still
inferior
to
Airbnb,
however.

Also
users
in
Brazil
generally
have
no
experience
with
such
sites
and
are
very
unreliable.
I
agree
with
everyone
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
stores
online
for
cell
phones.

Everything
is
what
you’d
expect
but
you
get
great
prices
on
top
of
it
all.

I’m
a
customer
for
life!
i
have
not
needed
to
try
the
ink
yet
so
I
can
comment
on
the
quality
of
your
product
I
love
the
low
prices!
I
ordered

they
where
the

Wow.
Just

high

and
let

tell
you,
those
expectations
were
met.

Town
Fair
Tire
on
Route
34
in
Derby
I
check
MCM's
website
before
I
go
anywhere
else.

The
catalogs
are
the
best.

Receiving
parts
the
day
after
I
place
an
order
is
highly
appreciated,
also.

As
far
as
any
improvements
go,
the
website
could
stand
to
be
upgraded.

Clicking
on
a

take
you

The
belts
should
be
organized
better,
too.

Maybe
classify
them
all
into
easy-to-understand
SBO,SBM,
FBL,
FBM
designations.


But
overall,
it's
a
fairly
easy
process
finding
what
I
need.

I
like
the
selection,
and
would
rather
look
through
an
MCM
catalog
than
any
other
I
can
think
of.
I
needed
a
passenger
side
mirror
for
my
2005
KIA
Sedona
.
When
I
saw
the
price
for
less
than
$60.00,
i
was
a
little
skeptical.
I
read
a
few
reviews
and
seen
that
they
had
good
ratings,
so
I
decided
to
order.
WOW
!!!!

My
mirror
came
in
3
business,
and
was
a
perfect
match,
color
and
all.

The
same
mirror
retails
at
over
$300,
but
I
couldn't
tell
the
difference.

Great
Job.
I
will
be
ordering
again.

Went
to
the
Billerica
location.
Spoke
with
the
person
at
the
counter
stating
that
I
was
looking
to
get
new
tires.
He
went
out
and
inspected
my
tires
and
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
replace
them,
just
needed
maintenance.
Was
expecting
to
be
up
sold
on
tires
and
services
not
be
told
your
tires
are
in

Will
definitely
come

Thanks.
I
would
recommend
PartsGeek
for
any
auto
part
need.

I
have
gotten
wipers
for
my
Mercedes
here,
that
were
double
the
price
locally.

I
need
some
repair
parts
for
my
truck
and
when
I
have
the
time
I
will
purchase
them
here.

The
site
is
easy

which
is
a
plus.

I
am
betting
it
is
due
to

and
will
keep
it,
but
makes
me
feel
uneasy.
Nice

FedEx
said
the
package
was

but
it

Sent

within

hours
they
responded
that
FedEx

delivered
it
to
the

and
the

Thanks!
I
was
very
pleased
with
my
first
experience
ordering
from
PetFlow.com.

The

was

much
quicker
than
I
anticipated.

That
was
an
extremely
pleasant
surprise
for
both
me

Great

They

their

5
Stars
isn't
enough.
Solid
enough
order
process
and
product
I
emailed
the
company
regarding
cod
liver
oil.
They
responded
quickly
and
very
comprehensively.
I
eventually
ordered
the
product
and
haven't
been
disappointed.
I
paid
for
next
day
delivery
as
I
needed
items
for
the
weekend.
I
had
emails
to
say
it
had
been
despatched
with
UPS
so
made
arrangements
to
stay
in
that
day.
I
stayed
in
all
day
to
some
considerable
inconvenience
only
to
get
an
email
at
nearly
8pm
off
UPS
to
say
it
would
be
delivered
the
next
business
day.
A
waste
of
a
day
and
no
products
for
the
weekend.
My
postage
has
been
refunded
but
there
has
been
no
apology
or
explanation
A
part
I
ordered
was
in
damaged
condition
when
I
received
it.
When
I
checked
the
website
for
Customer
Service
I
discovered
their
customer
service
was
almost
nonexistent.
In
order
to
get
any
kind
of
service
a
claim
ticket
must
be
completed
and
submitted
for
future
contact
via
e-mail.
There
is
no
phone
number
listed
to
actually
speak
to
somebody.
I
received
an
e-mail
within
a
day
and
given
directions
for
a
return
and
refund.
I
had
requested
a
telephone
call
but
was
ignored.
I
returned
the
part
today.
They
say
a
refund
will
be
given
within
30
days
of
receipt
of
the
part.
I'm
not
optimistic.
I
have
ordered
from
you
since
the
80's
and
like
the
80's,
you
still
ROCK!!!
Great
prices,
great
service,
great
products.

What
more
do
you
need
to
know?
I've
been
buying
from
Oldies.com
for
well
over
a
decade
and
have
never
had
the
slightest
problem
with
them.
They
have
a
good
selection
of
low-cost
DVDs,
coupled
with
prompt
and
reliable
delivery.
What's
not
to
like?
This
item
has
been
purchased
as
a
Christmas
gift
for
my
15year
old
Grandson
-
I
am
sure

that
he
will
enjoy
it
and
I
hope
it
fits.
I
would
use
this

and

I
know

Blackcircle,
and
i
am
definitely
going

them
again,
it
was
so
easy.
Amazon
is
where
I
do
90%
of
my
shoping
online
because
they
are
a
trusted
site
and
deal
with
problems
if
they
come
up
in
an
fast
manner.
I
dont
know
of
any
web
site
that
I
trust
as
much
as
amazon
to
do
my
shoping
at.
I
have
no

what
I

and
at
a

Dealing
with
PartsGeek
was,
and
still
is
.
.
.
a
nightmare.


When
I
first
ordered
on-line
-
no
email
confirmation
was
sent.

After
waiting
four
days
and
still
no
confirmation

-
I
tried
to
call
the
via
telephone.

I
tried
three
times
-
with
the
same
result.
I
got
put
on
hold
for
near
half
an
hour
each
time
with
a
message
claiming
"high
phone
traffic."
Then
-
after
a
long
wait

I
got
another
message
saying
"we're
not
taking
phone
calls
-
resolve
the
issue
on-line."

Seems
their
phone
#
is
a
work
of
fiction.
Just
had
one
order
so
far
and
impressed
with
product
and
service
will
be
placing
another
order
very
soon
I
had
a
bad
experience
but
their
customer
service
stepped
in
and
did
a
wonderful
job
at
correcting
the
problem.
I
needed
a
part
for
an
Honda
African
Twin
that
was
never
offered
in
the
USA.

CMS
helped
me
out
and
got
the
part
to
me
very
fast.

I
thought
the
shipping
price
was
a
little
on
the
high
side
for
such
a
small
part,
but
that's
the
price
I
have
to
pay
for
having
an
odd
ball
bike
in
the
wrong
part
of
the
world.
A
set
of
four
curved
octane
theater
chairs
were
my
first
order
with
Theater
Seat
store!
I
was
in
the
process
of
moving
and
couldn't
have
the
chairs
delivered
immediately,
but
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
special
price
at
the
time.
My
email
was
immediately
answered
which
was
followed
by
a
call.
They
offered
to
take
a
down
payment
for
the
purpose
of
ordering
the
chairs
for
manufacture
and
then
were
to
hold
them
in
their
warehouse
until
I
was
ready
to
take
possession.
Two
months
later
I
called
them
back,
made
final
payment
and
had
the
chairs
delivered
less
than
a
week
later.
The
seats
are
amazing!

They
are
my
first
theTer
seating,
but
came
in
excellent
packaging
and
were
very
simple
to
assemble
being
in
inly
two
pieces.
I
am
6'5"
and
220lbs
and
my
wife
is
5'3"
100lbs.
The
seats
fits
us
both
perfectly
and
are
extremely
comfortable
and
great
looking.
The
bonded
black
leather
looks
great
and
is
very
durable.
The
power
recline
offers
several
comfortable
seating
choices
for
any
size
person.
I
am
very
happy
with
the
purchase
and
look
forward
to
continued
use
for
years
to
come.
The
ordering
process
was
easy
to
use,
and
the
organising
of
the
delivery
was
handled
very
well.
Product
was
delivered
within
the
allotted
time.
Easy
to
use
site
and
no
problems
Can't
really
knock
the
service
I've
received.
And
really
great
deals!
Top
notch
parts
and
fast
shipping!!
Very
good
,
quick
delivery.
It's
awesome
site
as
well.
Despite
the
horrible
weather
that
day,
we
really
enjoyed
the
ride
(thanks
to
the
guide
and
the
beautiful
ponchos
!!).
The
only
flaws
:
the
red
route
finishes
at
about
5pm...much
too
early,
and
some
of
the
stations
are
not
that
easy
to
find,
especially
Green
Park
corner
opposite
Hard
Rock
Café
!!!
You
should
definitely
put
bigger
signs.
Same
as
above,
DME
had
exactly
what
I
needed
at
a
price
I
thought
was
good
so
I
purchased
two
tires
and
tubes.

They
are
on
my
chair
now!
Ordered
7
quality
products
with
engraving
on
a
Fri.
and
received
them
the
following
Tue.
looking
to
buy
some
upgrade
musical
gear

and
needed
advice.

Received
very
helpful
advice,
and
equipment
which
suited
my
needs
at
a
good
price.
ordered
various
items,
one
item,
a
pen,
had
a
problem,
the
replacement
was
sent
with
a
self
addresed
envelope
to
return
the
defective
one.

this
was
done
with
zero
fuzz
and
zero
cost
to
me
-
excellent
service
-
will
use
them
again.
good
prices
too
I
am
now
on
my
4th
call
to
them.
The
other
calls
were
all
abandoned
and
I
am
now
about
to
abandon
this
one
after
63
minutes.
Apparently
they
are
"doing
all
they
can
to
help"
I
submitted
my
prescription
but
the
lenses
are
blurry
and
don't
work
as
they
should.
i
shall
be
going
back
to
a
high
street
optician
Found
the
parts
I
was
looking
for
in
a
short
amount
of
time
at
the
Parts
Geek
web
site.
The
whole
process
was
very
quick
and
clean.
I
have
ordered
several
different
supplements
from
PureFormulas
and
I
have
been
very
satisfied
with
the
price.

I
have
been
EXTREMELY
satisfied
with
the
speed
of
delivery.

Of
course,
they
ship
me
the
brands,
quantities
and
"dosages"
I
request.

Good
job
done
and
quickly.
When
I
looked
for
a
phone
number
for
the
Wabash
Inn
and
got
your
"800"
number,
I
didn't
realize
it
was
a
reservation
number
that
was
going
to
charge
me
$13
a
night
to
book
through
it.


I'll
never
do
that
again.
Suburban
thermostat
assembly
arrived
on
time.
Price
was
a
fraction
of
the
local
RV
dealer
price
on
this
item.
I
would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
and
everyone.
Great
experience,
great
service,
and
quality
parts.
Thank
you
Fox

cars
has
no
customer
service
and
if
I
can
save
just
one
person
from
renting
from
them
then
my
time
has
been
well
spent.
After
trying
to
call

times

never

Flying
from
Massachusetts
to
Arizona
(with
a
plane
change
in
Minneapolis),
there
was
no
way
that
i
would
lug
my
clubs
to
and
from
the
airport.
I
easily
convinced
the
rest
of
my
foursome
to
use
Ship
Sticks.
Off
the
plane
in
Phoenix,
30
minutes
to
the
TPC,
ready
for
our
1:13
tee
time.
Everyone's
clubs
had
arrived
except
mine!
Apparently
the
UPS
driver
realized
when
he
returned
to
his
depot
the
previous
day
that
he
still
had
one
set
in
the
truck,
so
he'd
deliver
them
the
next
day.
But
that
would
be
2
hours
after
my
tee
time!
I
called
Ship
Sticks,
they
gave
me
a
credit
card
#
to
use
up
to
$200
to
rent
clubs,
buy
balls,
shoes,
glove,
socks,
tees,
hat
and
sunscreen.
Now
that's
service!
On
the
7th
fairway,
my
own
clubs
were
brought
out
to
me.
Yea
Ship
Sticks!
You
people
are
awesome!
You
turned
my
somewhat
profitable
business
into
more
profitable
because
of
the
quality,
price
and
service
of
your
products.
Thanks!
Used
this
web
site
to
book
my
trip
to
France
in
September.
I
ended
up
booking
with
the
same
company
that
I
h]ave
always
used
but
was
surprised
and
p[leased
to
see
the
other
options
which
might
have
been
available
to
me.
I'd
recommend
you
to
have
a
look
if
you
are
booking
to
travel
to
Europe
by
ferry.
Very
impressed
that
they
delivered
within
a
specific
time
period
and
that
the
driver
checked
the
goods
with
me
before
leaving
Shopping
with
this
site
was
a
pleasure
from
stat
to

I
made
a
call
and
spoke
to
a
rep
that
stated
I
would
have
my
bag
on
a
certain
date
and
it
was
delivered
in
a
timely
fashion.
Thanks!
my
first
order
with
partsgeek
was
a
very
good
one
and
as
i
tell
other
people
when
you
order
stuff
off
line
make
sure
you
enter
the
right
info
in
for
the
part
you
need
and
you
should
get
what
you
needed
and
in
my
case
i
got
it
cheaper
here
then
by
a
dealer
or
auto
store
.
Ordered
from
the
states.

Pen
got
here
quickly
and
was
exactly
what
I
wanted.

I'll
be
a
repeat
customer.
Great
prices
Great
quality

and
fast

I
have
bought
Silver
here
and
will
continue
to
do
so....
The
prices
for
the

are
some
of
the
best
on
the
market
and
the
buying
process
is
simple
once
you
get
set
up....

Was

If

line
and
you
won't
get
a

to
talk
to.

You'll
get
your

message
transcribed
to
an

They
sent
my
part
to
the
wrong
address,
and
would
not
do
anything
to
correct
the
problem.

They
told
me
to
contact
the
party
which
they
sent
my
part
to
1700
miles
away
from
my
address.

Thank

for

After
chatting
for
a

we
finally
straightened
out
cost
and
delivery
increments
this
company
has
really
out

As

I
was

skeptical
buying

for
such
a
great
price,
not
to
mention
from
another
country.
I'm
in
the
US.
I
knew
these
were
the
frames
I
wanted
as
I
had
already
tried
them
on
and
found
this
site
while
searching
online.
I
was
happy
to
see
them
$20
cheaper
than
any
other
site
or
store
and
the
free
Rx
lenses
are
what
saved
me
at
least
another
$60.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
about
the
$11
shipping
and
it
got
from
then
to
me
in
26hrs!
Very
happy
and
no
buyers
remorse
st
all.
Highly
recommended
and
thank
you
for
the
great
service
Just
go
on-line
order
and
in
less
then
a
week
you
have
your
food.
Prices
are
comparable
the
food
is
fresh.
The
mark
of
a
good
company
is
how
they
deal
with
problems
when
they
inevitably
arise.
Good
source
for
EVO
pet
food.
I
believe
in
your
products
to
promote
good
health,at
60
they
help
with
my
feeling
of
wellness
as
does
my
faith
in
JESUS!!
Product
seems
to
be
what
it
says.

Delivered
was
quick.
No

I
bought
rotors
and

and

Very

was
after...totally

dear

Very
speedy
and
efficient

and
easy
to

I
have
always
been
put
off
by
selling
mobile

online
beacuse
of
the

Mazuma

the
whole

Fantastic

!
Speedy

!

definitly
use

I
booked
with
Thrifty
because
they
offered
a
Subaru
Liberty.
I
thought
I
had
booked
and
paid
for
a
Subaru
Liberty,
my
confirmation
was
for
a
Subaru
Liberty,
I
didn't
end
up
with
a
Subaru
Liberty
Good
and
fast
service.
No
problems
with
the
package.
Very
good
and
accurate
website

We
stayed
at
Sabiha
Residence
near
Sabiha
Gokcen
Airport.
Everything
was
perfect
!
Great
service
and
if
anyone
is
needing
BMW
parts,
this
is
the
site
to
go
to.
Immediate
shipping
and
a
pleasure
to
order
from.
Ordered
a
driver
side
door
handle,
now
just
need
to
get
it
on
the
car.
After
sending
my
tablet
in
two
separate
times
repairs
for
the
same
thing
and
my
tablet
still
not
working
I
got
my
payout.
While
it
took
a
few
weeks
since
I
ultimately
had
to
send
it
in
three
times,

I
am
definitely
happy
I
had
insurance
on
my
tablet.
Really
good
price
for
my
phone,
booked
it
online
with
a
really
simple
form,
once
I
received
the
details
and
sent
the
phone
the
cheque
arrived
in
a
couple
of
days.
I
have
been
using
Jessops
online
photo
service
for
years
now
and
they
have
never
let
me
down.

For
sheer
dependability
and
value
for
money,
it
deserves
5
stars.
We
have
bought
twice
from
Table-Tennis-Tables
and
they
have
been
first
class
on
both
occasions.

Items
ordered
online
have
turned
up
very
promptly
and
without
even
having
to
think
about
chasing.


Definitely
recommended!
Very
fast
delivery
of
some
basic
stationery
that
I
had
not
found
elsewhere.
B&H
offered
the
best
price
I
could
find
anyplace.
New
hob
has
not
been
installed
yet
but
looks
very
great.
I
recently
found
pureformulas.com
and
ordered
a
couple
items
and
I
am
satisfied
with
the
experience
so
far.
The
shipping
was
fast
and
the
prices
were
good.and
they
carry
homeopathic
remedies
which
is
a
plus.

The
free
shipping
was
one
of
the
most
important
qualities
and
it's
a
major
plus
to
customers
like
me.
I
cannot
believe
the
size
I
found
for
the
price!
I
am
saving
$30/Month
over
the
popular
storage
facilities
out
there
and
I
can
fit
an
entire
2
bedroom
apartment
worth
of
stuff
in
this
unit!
The
only
inconvenience
is
there
are
not
enough
locations.
The
only
problem
is
returning
your
bad
part
for
the
core
charge.

They
take
what
should
be
a
relatively
easy
procedure
and
make
it
difficult.

When
the
new
part
goes
out,
just
put
a
return
label
in
the
box
to
use
when
sending
the
bad
part
back
Ordered
some
shirts.
Nice,
no
fuss
transaction
and
delivery
exactly
as
stated.
Can't
fault
the
service.
Thank
you.
This
is
the
third
time
I've
used
Blackcircles
and
will
certainly
be
back
once
I've
worn
these
tyres
out.
Being
able
to
use
a
local
garage
makes
life
much
easier.
I've
checked
many
other
websites
and
Blackcircles
was
always
the
best
value
for
the
tyres
I
was
after
(mid-range).
Excellent
customer
service
at
the
garage
also
helped
the
overall
experience.
It
was
really
fast
and
easy
thanks
easytobook
I
have
ordered
several
Pure
Encapsulation
products
from
Pure
Formulas
and
the
products
and
service
were
excellent.

My
latest
medical
doctor
just
recommended
them
to
me
and
when
I
told
her
that
I
had
already
placed
an
order,
she
said
that
she
had
always
been
pleased
with
their
formulations
and
that
it
is
the
only
company
she
uses
in
her
practice
for
supplements.

That
is
the
best
recommendation
I
have
heard
for
supplements.

I
will
definitely
be
ordering
again.

Thanks
for
great
products!

I

will
continue
to
do
so!!!
I
can
write
this
review
now
having
actually
recieved
the
bloody
goods
I
ordered.
They
usually
deliver
on
time
but
my
last
2
times
were
not
good.
I
emailed
asking
to
move
up
delivery
by
1
week
and
they
never
answered
and
then
last
delivery
was
1
week
late.
First
of
all
the
delivery
time
was
very
good,
3
days
from
order
to
delivery.
The
bike
is
very
good
value,
its
fairly
easy
to
put
together.
Good
value
for
the
money
which
is
very
rare
these
days
.


Thank
You
Very
easy

I
booked
a
beautiful
apartment
in
Paris
on
Wimdu
as
a
present
for
my
parents,
it
was
simple
to
find
and
to
book
the
kind
of
apartment
I
was
looking
for.
My
parents
had
a
great
time
in
Paris,
I
would
definately
recommend
this
service!
prices
are
excellent
and
service
quick
and
efficient.
Only
thing
I
would
say
is
that
sometimes
the
items
arrive
in
a
box
that
is
a
little
big
so
when
you
open
it
up
the
items
have
been
roughed
up
a
bit.
Bit
to
be
honest
this
is
being
very
picky
and
seeing
as
I
mostly
buy
underwear
from
you
it
goes
straight
into
the
wash
anyway!
quick

likely
be
using
these

for
all
my
tyres
in

Cheaper
than
all
the
alternatives.
I
ordered
on
the
site,
was
able
to
add
a
gift
card
and
put
delivery
instructions
on
which
is
important
for
where
my
father
lives.
He
texted
me
a
few
days
later
thanking
me
(it
was
over
a
weekend)

the

brilliant.
I
was
also
able

track

I
can

on
B+H

business.

Hi

MANY

Prices
are
unbeatable;
I
rely
on
their
expertise
and
recommendations
to
assist
in
deciding
what
items
I
need
to
acquire
and
their
compatibility
with
my
existing
devices.
I
have
been
purchasing
photo
equipment
from
B&H
Photo-Video
for
many
years.

They
have
never
disappointed
me.

The
items
have
always
been
shipped
when
they
said
and
their
customer
service
is
second
to
none.
The
prices
are
so
low
the
competitive
pricing
just
tops
it
off!
Fast
shipping!
Love
the
site!!!
Good
range,
very
competitive
prices,
fast
and
reliable
delivery.
Staffed
by
cyclists
who
are
knowledgeable
and
friendly.
More
delivery
options
would
have
been
preferable,
and
the
order
was
a
single
item,
but
the
price
was
right
and
delivery
was
as
promised.

Would
definitely
check
them
again
for
IT
purchases.
I
ordered
Christmas
lights,
which
were
delivered
within
a
couple
of
days.

Most
impressive
was
the
delivery
options
via
DPD.

I
was
notified
by
email
if
the
proposed
delivery
date
with
options
to
change
the
date,
or
have
the
item
delivered
to
a
neighbour.

I
opted
to
stick
with
the
original
delivery
date
and
arranged
to
work
from
home.

I
then
got
a
further
email
advising
me
that
delivery
would
take
place
between
11:41
and
12:41.

Yeah,
right,
I
thought.

Delivery
made
at
12:05.

Unbelievable!
Good
website,
accurate
information,
really
fast
turnaround
and
despatch
and
finally
great
telephone
support
-
pointing
out
my
own
misunderstanding!
I
have
done
business
with
B&H
almost
from
the
day
they
opened.

NEVER--not
once--was
I
ever--in
any
way--disappointed
with
the
products
and
service
I
received
from
them.

B&H
sets
the
standard
for
professionalism.

Some
day
I
must
visit
their
New
York
store.
Town
Fair
Tire
was
exactly
like
the
ad
you
see
on
tv.
They
were
great
to
deal
with.
I
booked
a
car
rental
through
Auto
Europe,
who
aligned
me
with
Europecar
in
Portugal.

They
required
full
payment
prior
to
departing
on
the
trip.

When
I
picked
up
the
car
in
Lisbon,
I
was
disappointed
to
see
it
was
not
even
relatively
new
and
was
on
empty.

Upon
driving
the
car,
I
discovered
mechanical
problems
and
had
to
trade
in
this
car
for
another.

This
second
car
was
quite
old,
with
almost
100,000
kilometers
on
it,
and
a
tempormental
transmission.

Later
that
day
it
began
to
rain
and
I
discovered
that
both
wiper
blades
were
totally
worn
out,
making
driving
both
dangerous
and
frustrating.

After
four
days
of
this,
I
returned
the
car
early,
having
paid
for
eight
days.

Europecar
agreed
I
was
due
a
50%
refund,
but
that
I
would
have
to
get
it
from
Auto
Europe
in
that
I
had
prepaid
fully
with
them.

When
I
contact
Auto
Europe
for
the
refund,
they
refused.

Effectively,
I
paid
twice
the
going
rate
for
a
car
that
was
dangerous
to
drive.

Their
representative
indicated
this
was
not
their
problem.
Don't
try
calling
to
order
a
part.
You
won't
get
through.
Called
over
10
times,
yes,
10
times,
waited
on
hold
only
to
get
a
voice
message
to
try
again
later,
then
hang
up.
Then
I
had
a
??
about
a
part
and
was
told
the
more
expensive
one
is
the
better
part.
We
are
talking
about
a
$10
difference.
Then
I
order
the
parts,
both
were
listed
as
"in
stock".
Then
2
days
later
I
receive
an
email
that
only
1
is
in
stock
and
has
been
shipped,
before
I
could
cancel
the
order.
They
were
struts,
kinda
need
to
replace
both
at
the
same
time.
I
would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
as
they
have
been
fast
in
doing
business
with
us.
WE
received
our
duck
dog
food
and
was
very
happy
to
get
it,
when
we
had
to
take
our
dog
off
the
food
we
called
and
they
are
willing
to
refund
us
for
the
remaining
cans.
We
appreciate
everything
Received
part
in
a
timely
manneer.
It
fit
perfectly.
Great
service,
speedy
delivery
and
awesome
prices.
I
will
definitely
shop
at
Heinnie
Haynes
again!
For
anything
electronic,
I
would
only
and
ALWAYS
shop
at
B
&
H
Video.
The
choices
of
whiskies
are
excellent
as
are
all
the
other
spirits.

Prices
are
keen
and
service
extremely
fast.
I
would
recommend
365
Electrical.
It's
a
reservation
system
where
you
can
expect
a
fair
deal
in
a
very
organized
web
site.
I
love
shopping
with
B&H.
From
their
website
to
their
quick
delivery
(NYC
to
Boston),
to
their
iPhone
app,
it's
seamless.
Part
worked
fine
in
time
on
schedule
and
at
a
fair
price,
would
do
it
again!
Quick
shipping,
spot
on
what
I
order!!
Glad
I
found
this
site
will
order
from
them
again
and
again!!!!
This
will
be
our
9th

the
PYR
Fuengirola.
Since
we
have
booked
through
ALPHAROOMS
we
have
found
the
process
very
easy
and

I
had
never
ordered
like
this
from
an
online
store,
so
I
was
weary
of
completing
the
order.
However
I
chose
to
carry
on
as
the
website
was
easy
to
use,
and
to
navigate.

I
like
the
way
I
was
informed
when
my
order
had
been
despatched,
all
I
had
to
do
now
was
wait
for
my
order
to
arrive.
Low
and
behold
the
order
arrived,
exactly
when
it
was
estimated
to
arrive.
I
will
be
using
the
site
again
in
the
future
and
have
already
recommended
it
to
friends
who
cycle
too.
I
found
the
part
I
needed,
ordered
it,
and
it
arrived
when
they
said
it
would.
When
I
added
on
skype
about
his
gold
swapping
service(eoc
to

he
added
and
replied
within
a
couple
hours(I
added
in
the
middle
of
the
night).

I
ordered
parts
to
rebuild
the
front
end
of
my

All
of
the
parts
were
in
stock
and
shipped
very
fast.

One
of
the
parts
got
separated
from
the
main
order
and
when
I
filed
a
customer
inquiry
I
received
very
timely
response
with
the
offer
of
sending
a
replacement
part.

The
missing
part
actually
arrived
the
next
day
so
reshipment
was
unnecessary.
Used
H.H
a
number
of
times
now
over
many
years.

shop
for
a

which
I
re-ordered
from

which
as

arrived
in

Good
experience,
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for
I
asked
for
the
cheapest
unit
for
about
2
months
that
was
driving
to
CT
to
get
my
stuff
out
of
my
other
Public
Storage
in
Manchester
CT
and
that
I
was
upsizing
and
finally
rejoining
my
space.
She
gave
me
a
unit
with
two
doors.
I
specifically
asked
if
I
only
needed
the
one
lock
she
said
yes.
About
10
to
14
days
later
I
was
called
by
another
property
manager
saying
my
unit
wasn't
locked.
Well
I
was
furious
came
up
there
and
it
was
they
just
wanted
me
to
spend
another
20
dollars
to
pay
for
a
lock
for
the
other
door.
I
wasn't
happy
about
this
at
all.
Not
good
service.
I'm
a
thrifty
person
by
nature,
and
in
this

age
eating
right
and
keeping

is
hard.
It's
so
much
easier
and
cheaper
to
be
unhealthy
in
this

so
when
you
find
a
store
like

with
they're
5%
off
any
competitor's

its
a
win
win
situation.
I've
been

many

bouncing
back
and
forth,
not
anymore

this
site...supplementwarehouse

me
in
great
shape
at
a
great
price.
The
only
individual
I
had
any
contact
with
was
quite
abrupt
on
the
phone
issuing
orders
as
though
talking
to
a
toddler.
He
was
late
when
we
arrived
at
the
airport,
even
though
he
instructed
us
to
ring
when
we
were
only
10
minutes
away
and
I'm
sure
that
my
drivers
door
now
has
an
extra
ding,
though
I
cant
prove
it.
Great
experience
overall.

than

just
a

much,
and
the
colors
weren't

it
was
still
a

was

when

got
it.
I
used
it

I
do

through
the

and
my
waist
shrinks.
So
I
bought

3.
It's
a
32"
and
a
little

small
today,
but
I'm
expecting
it
to
be

3
different
times
in
Italy
after
renting
a
car
through
AE
on-line!
They
always
find
a
way
of
tacking
on
plenty
of
Euros
in
additional
fees
and
taxes.
This
time
in
Naples
they
zapped
for
an
additional
23
euro
for
local
taxes
and
a
whopping
60
Euro
for
the
1/8
of
a
tank
unfilled
at
the
station
in
fuel.
That
1/8
of
a
tank
should
have
come
to
about
12-15
Euro!
When
I
challenged
the
counter
clerks
about
this,
they
said,
"We
don't
speak-a
dee
English."
I
will
wait
to
rent
when
I
get
to
the
country
location
because
Auto
Europe
just
does
not
get
it!

did
not
fit
on

G6.

I
had
to
use
self-tapping
screws
to
create
new
holes
because
the
one

me
did
not
have
the
holes
in
the
correct
position
and
the
frame
of
the

itself
was
much
larger
than
the
original
that
I
removed.

quickly

didn't

any!

the

hanger
was

and
when
I
called
they
said
my

must
be
an
older
version
which
was
different.
I
hadn't
known
there
were

and
they
hadn't
asked
the
age
of
the

I
asked
for
a

it

The

then
arrived

no

I
sent

anyway
at

of

it
was

me...

When

looked

phoned
me
to
let

know

to

managed
to

they
would,

all
Rachael

Leah
do

me
everyday.


They
are
always
willing
to
help
and
their
friendly
demeaner
and
positive
attitude
make
our
work
environment
enjoyable.

They
are
always
extremely
polite
and
welcoming
to
my
clients
that
come
to
the

We
are
lucky
to
have
them
both

Everything

The

what
I
needed

make
the
repairs
Non
posso
che
dare
un
giudizio
positivo.
Velocissimi
e
molto
convenienti.
I
don't
remember
all
the
times
this

happened
but
recently
I
bought
a

It

than
other
airlines.
Thank
you.

Top
supplier,
have
bought
from
them
Five
times
now
and
every
time
superb
service,
on
this
particular
purchase
I
did
have
a
very
small
problem
which
was
swiftly
resolved
by
a
very
kind
and
considerate
young
lady
in
Jade
Smith,
who
had
excellent
personable
communication
qualities
resulting
in
a
swift
solution
,

I
had
ordered
some
hot
&
sweet
peppers
from
Upper
Darby,
Pa.
to
be
shipped
to
my
restaurant
in
Texas.

The
total
cost
from
the
trucking
companies
I
had
contacted
ranged
from
$433
on
the
low
side
to
$478
on
the
high
side
and
this
was
just
days
after
Christmas.

I,
purely
by
accident,
contacted
FreightPro
for
one
last
quote
and
when
they
contacted
me
with
their
cost
($215)
I
thought
they
had
made
a
mistake
and
asked
them
to
make
sure
that
they
copied
the
information
I
gave
them
correctly.

The
cost
of
the
peppers
was
$468
so
the
savings
I
realized
made
me
a
believer.

I
will
continue
to
use
FreightPro
as
I
ship
from
the
same
location
about
three
times
a
year.

My
contact
person
was
the
bomb
and
took
very
good
care
of
me.
I
will
want
to
see
one
day
free
shipping.
I
rented
two
cars
in
two
countries
during
one
trip
to
Europe
and
had
a
pleasant
experience
with
both.
Very
pleasant
and
helpful
staff
in
Nice
and
in
Milan.
The
cars
were
clean
and
operated
well.
I
needed
brass
nuts
for
my

I've
been
ordering
from
B&H
for
many
years
and
I
am
always
delighted
by
the
inventory
and
the
professional
handling
of
all
aspects
of
my
eventual
purchases.
Quick,
Accurate
and
at
a
great
price!
Prices

minutes,
phone

Fantastic

All

Highly

I
have
used
the

Albelli
Photobooks
both
personally
and
professionally
as
a
wedding
photographer.
The
quality
of
the
finished
article
is
always
outstanding
and
everyone,
friends,
family
and
clients
are
inspired
by
the
sheer
exuberance
of
the
images.
I
would
recommend
this
product
to
anyone.
My
word
of
advice
would
be,
don't
rush
it.
When
you
think
it's
finished,
leave
it
overnight
and
then
re-visit,
there
is
always
a
line
that
can
be
straightened
or
a
space
that
can
be
filled.
Website

Overall

Good
service!!
I
have
dealt
with
many
online
pool
supply
companies
over
the
years
-
some
have
very
good
service
with
reasonable
prices
-
depending
on
the
specific
item.
Other
companies
have
cheap
prices
on
everything,
but
lack
quality
in
the
products
and
have
poor
customer
service.
One
experience
with
those
companies
is
more
than
enough.
I'm
sure
anyone
reading
this
review
who
has
ever
bought
anything
online
have
had
the
same
experiences.

It's
often
hit
and
miss.
They
made
the
whole
experience
with
our
tax
settlement
non
stressful
with
continuous
communication
and
working
with
us
to
get
the
best
offer
possible.

I
would
refer
them
to
family
and
friends.

:)
The
facility
has
minimal
security,
but
the
attendant
was
courteous
and
helpful.

The
attendant
said
they
perform
routine
lock
checks,
which
is
good.

They
have
a
few
cameras,
but
the
fences
at
the
back
of
the
property
would
be
easy
to
defeat.

In
good
value
for
money,
pront
respond
to
email
and
phone
calls,
excellent
customer
service,
professional
attitude
from
all
services
and
staff.
I
recomende
this
company
to
friends
and
family
and
others.
happy
customer,
many
thanks
Part
(Mira
pilot
valve)
supplied
fitted
fine,
but
having

flow
would
not

Split

I
ordered
some
jet
replacements
on
25
October
2013
and
when
I
was
working
with
the
online
representative
he
stated
the
jets
were
in
stock.

However,
it
still
took
until
1
November
for
the
items
to
be
shipped.
I
kept
trying
to
find
out
why
my
order
was
delayed
and
was
told
someone
would
get
back
to
me
and
they
never
did
until
the
jets
were
finally
shipped
a
week
later.

Very
disappointed
in
the
costumer
service.
I
ordered
two
sets
of
tickets,
one
from
Paris
to
the
UK,
the
other
Paris-Avignon-Paris.

I
found
the
web-site
very
easy
to
use.

I
live
in
the
USA,
and
wasn't
able
to
use
my
debit
card
to
pay.

But
I
had
no
trouble
paying
with
my
credit
card.
This
was
our
first
time
in
Oak
Furniture
Land
and
was
only
for
a
browse,
however,
we
spotted
a
very
nice
display
unit
which
looked
excellent
quality
and
at
a
very
reasonable
price.
Parts
delivered
quickly
and
correct...
Was
impressed
will
be
ordering
from
again.
Great
Job.
The

Thank

Fantastic

Delighted
with

absolutely
delighted

Very
unsatisfactory!
Arrived
at
Heathrow
and
had
to
ring
StressFreeParking
twice
to
get
car
collected.

Risked
getting
parking
ticket
in
the
process.
My
purchases
have
been
of
the
highest
quality.

ADS
has
been
exceptionally
accommodating
with
any
prescription
problems
due
to
goggle

or

I
will
definitely
purchase
products
again
from

in
the

Stayed

Yesterday
was
my
first
order
on
Onlinekeystore
and
it
was
great.
I
got
a
Call
of
Duty
Black
Ops
Steam
key
for
cheap
and
it
had
fast
delivery.
I
contacted
support
just
to
make
sure
everything
was
going
through
and
they
responded
very
promptly.
I
highly
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
searching
for
games.
I
find
it
a
great
site
to
buy
or
rent
textbooks
for
any
class,
with
great
quality
at
a
very
low
cost.
I
use
this
one
to
translate
and
learn
new
words
in
other
languages
and
in
English
too,
it
is
quite
informative
and
easy
to
use,
I
love
it
:)
It
has
everything,
and
it
is
unlimited
about
what
you
can
do
as
a
manager
of
your
own
team,
the
only
thing
I
would
love
to
see
is
a
little
change,
in
which
the
hattrick
live
matches
instead
of
reading
what
happened
in
the
match
watching
a
mini
java,
shockwave,
ms
silverlight,
or
any
video
platform
of
what
happened
in
the
match,
and
also
a
feature
of
changing
that
background
color
of
the
website,
not
just
green,
but
purple,
black,
blue,
red,
yellow,
etc.
Other
than
that
the
game
is
great.
My
experience
with
you
it's
always
great,
I
find
everything
I
need,
and
cheaper
than
anywhere
else
you're
still
to
my
opinion
on
top
of
the
game,
so
keep
it
up.
Whoever
doesn't
know
Amazon
they
don't
know
how
to
shop
wisely
over
the
internet.
With
Amazon,
99.9%
of
the
things
you
want
to
buy
you
will
find
it
there
and
many
of
them
cheaper
than
any
other
store.
I
recommend
it
very
much
to
anybody.
Keep
it
up.
To
me
twitter
is
just
like
a
big
news
and
gossip
website,
in
which
everybody
gets
to
find
out
what
other
people
(famous
or
not),
organizations,
TV
shows,
etc.
do.
It's
just
like
texting,
you
can
just
write
160
characters
as
your
status?
Or
maybe
a
picture?
Really?
That's
why
you
also
have
a
Facebook,
with
FB
you
can
do
all
of
that
already,
and
follow
people
too.
Twitter
doesn't
surprise
me,
is
just
like
any
other
simple
social
media
website.
Thank
you.
I
conceive
Paypal
very
much,
hopefully
it
never
gets
hacked
or
take
advantage
of
its
customers.
It
is
used
for
many
millions
of
people
and
trusted
almost
everywhere
for
any
monetary
transaction,
and
so
far
for
me
it
hasn't
let
me
down
yet,
when
I
purchase
something
using
it
or
when
transferring
money
from
one
place
to
another,
it
is
just
great!
I
just
simply
love
it,
it
is
the
best
video
site
out
there
and
the
most
complete
collection
of
videos,
where
you
can
find
anything
you
would
want
to
watch
and
from
many
languages.
One
feature
that
some
other
video
website
have
that
I'd
love
YouTube
could
add
is
the
ability
to
change
the
aspect
ration
of
the
videos
played
like
16:9,
4:3,
etc,
and
an
ability
to
"switch
on
and
off
the
lights"
of
the
website,
while
watching
a
video
so
it
looks
darker
if
you
don't
like
putting
the
vids
on
full-screen..
You
can
find
many
things
at
cheaper
costs
compared
to
other
retail
stores.
It's
very
easy
to
more
around
the
site
and
find
what
you
need.
Google
is
the
best
search
engine
out
there,
gives
you
more
specific
answers
to
your
inquiries,
whatever
you
type,
bam
is
there.
The
only
thing
that
I'm
missing
from
it,
is
the
cache
or
"highlighted"
feature
that
it
had
when
you
wanted
to
find
where
something
was
written
in
a
website.
In
my
opinion
you
don't
need
to
shop
anywhere
else.
They
have
everything
you
need!
The
customer
service
should
set
the
standard
for
other
businesses.
The
salespeople
are
very
knowledgeable


about
there
products
and
they
are
willing
to
help
you
if
you
have
any
questoions.

I
couldn't
wait
to
get
my
repaired
laptop
home.
Well
I
was
disappointed
to
see
it
was
still
running
slow.
Something's
not
right
with
it.
So
I
took
it
back
the
next
day
and
explained
my
disappointment.
Well
it
was
checked
right
away
as
I
stood
there.
I
must
say
I
was
glad
about
that.
It
meant
we
could
both
see
my
concerns.
The
assistant
explained
it
was
fixed
but
needed
a
new
card
to
get
it
to
the
speed
I
wanted.
Again
he
explained
a
few
alternatives
and
pointers.
I
left
my
laptop
there
for

the
updating
it
required.
The
very
next
day
I
got
my
laptop
back
running
great.
Also
the
added
extra
work
was
completed
as
the
original
job
and
not
two
separate
orders.
Thoughtful
considerate
and
quick.
Working
as
part
of
the
Trustpilot
team
is
a
true
pleasure.

This
is
an
exciting
and
dynamic
place
to
work
with
a
product
offering
and
vision
that
is
second
to
none.

Every
member
of
the
Trustpilot
family
works
as
a
team
to
help
each
other
and
the
company
get
better
and
grow
every
day.

Truly
,
every
day
at
Trustpilot
is
a
5
star
day!!!
Herb

were
well

I
was
very
pleased
with
the
price
and
the
speedy

Very
user
friendly
site.

Would
highly
recommend
to
any
of
my

or

Really
efficient
and
fast
service.

Kept
me
up
to

with
the
order
process
and
delivery
date,
and
it
arrived
bang
on
time.

Will
definitely
use
them
again.
I've
used
this
shop
several
times
in
the
past,
and
have
visited
the
store
on
occasion
when
passing
by.

The
staff
are
superb
and
the
selection
of
clothing
and
gear
is
excellent.
The
staff
offer
sound
advice
and
are
willing
to
spend
as
much
time
with
you
as
you
need,
without
being
pushy.
I
would
definitely
recommend
GAK
to
anyone,
items

I
will
be

GAK
from
now

for
my
music

Have
used
them
in

and
will
use

The

I
used

parts
all
went
very
well
parts
were
tracked
on

well
packed
and
a
great
product
infact
it
is
easy
for
me
here
in
the
UK
to
buy
parts
from
CMS
in
Holland
than
it
is
to
purchase
here
in

I
have
used

several
times
and
there

are
so
low
and
the

free
and
very
fast
100%
the
best
by

Purchased

Over

for

Sent

It

Terrible

I

a

that
I
will

Customer
service
is
awesome
Ordering
was
a
breeze.

Pack/ship
process
was
fast.

Delivered
as
promised
and
on
time.

Would
buy
from
them
again.
I
was
very
disappointed
in
the
quality
of
both
the
coffee
and
the
capsules
with
Fine
Coffee.
The
capsule
tops
are
difficult
to
pierce
when
inserted
into
the
Nespresso
machine
-
I
think
they
will
eventually
break
the
machine.
The
quality
of
the
coffee
is
average,
about
Folgers
or
Taster's
Choice
level.
For
the
small
difference
in
price,
I'd
rather
purchase
Nespresso.
Parts
were
great
and
the
price
was
not
too
bad
either!
Bought
2
outside
Christmas
lights,
both
of
which
were
as
described
and
delivered
quickly.
Item
was
competitively
priced
and
arrived
very
quickly.

Will
be
using
them
again.

No
problem
recommending
their
service.
Ordered
new
range
cooker
and
microwave
online.

Good
prices
compared
to
other
sites.

Got
emails
and
phone
call
before

date.

Great
communications.
Ordered
a
new
sink
and
tap.

Arrived
safely
on
agreed
date.
I
have
only
good
things
to
say
about
ShopTo.

Product
availability
is
excellent
and
delivery
the

I've

We've
been
a

of

Bookbyte.com
made
getting
college
textbooks
so
easy.
As
an
incoming
freshman
purchasing
textbooks
for
the
first
time,
it
was
a
relief
finding
a
website
that
was
so
easy
to
use.
I've
already
purchased
three
textbooks
and
plan
on
purchasing
more
in
the
future.
Ordered
a
harness,
pair
of
carabiners
and
some
cord.

Shortly
after
placing
my
order,
I
received
an
email
from
Mike
with
OMC
stating
that
the
harness
I
have
selected
was
in
fact
out
of
stock.

Instead
of
cancelling
the
order,
we
were
able
to
find
a
different
harness
(
more
expensive
than
the
one
I
had
originally
selected),
and
they
were
still
willing
to
give
me
the
other
harness
at
the
same
price
as
the
first.

This
is
my
first
order
from
OMCGear.com,
and
it
will
not
be
my
last!
I
ordered
a
Faber
Castell
pen
and
mechanical
pencil.
Due
to
the
amount
I
spent
they
came
with
a
free
gift!
Despite
the
Xmas
break
they
arrived
within
48
hours
of
ordering
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise.
Goods
were
packaged
well
and
arrived

free.
Would
definately

Booked
a

the

otherwise
we

The

was
closed
because
we
arrived
after

and

we
had
to

$200
to

The
agency
allowed
us
to
book
one

for
five
people
EVEN
though
it
was
against

policy.
The

had
to
make
an
exception
in

because
it

booked.

the

I

I
was
a
little
unsure
about
whether
the
jacket
I
received
was
the
exact
same
version
of
the
Mera
Peak
they
had
advertised,
as
the
pictures
had
some
small
differences,
but
I
was
very
pleased
with
their

anyway
and
the
am
very
pleased
with

regardless

the
version.
I
was
extremely
satisfied
with
their

which

was
just
what

needed.
They

that

however
is

as

as

The
actual

is

I
was
pretty

I
was
treated
with
respect
and
felt
at
ease
with
the
guy
that
loaned
me
a
car....I
wasnt
pressured
to
buy
extra`s
but
I
did
anyway.....great
service....but
I
must
say
one
thing....I
think
that
at
Billund
Airport,the
staff
should
come
to
the
hire
car...and
when
it
returns,they
should
be
there
to
inpect
with
the
person
who
has
hired
the

´car..(.this
is
not
a
complaint,just
an
observation)
I
was
very
pleased
at
the
selection
and
the
special
offers
that
PetFlow.com
has.

I
placed
my
first
order
and
received
it
well
before
my
expectations.

The
only
negative
part
of
the
entire
experience
would
have
to
be
the
packaging
my
order
came
in.

My
order
included
Qty.
10
small
pet
botanicals
trial
food
rolls
and
because
everything
was
just
placed
in
a
large
envelope,
the
envelop
looks
to
have
broken
open
in
shipping
and
I
only
received
7
of
the
10
I
ordered.

They
were
only
.99
cents
each
so
I
did
not
bother
making
a
complaint
however
I
wanted
to
include
that
in
this
review
so
they
may
read
this
and
hopefully
take
better
care
in
preparing
their
shipments.
This
was

I

with

they
were

in

I
was
searching
for
a
new
electric
guitar
for
my
son
who
needed
an
upgrade
from
his
3/4
size.
Did
some
research
and
found
what
I
thought
I
wanted
-
rang
Gak
customer
service
as
they
had
the
guitar
I
wanted
in
3
trims
all
at
different
prices.
The
chap
I
spoke
to
talked
me
through
the
variables
and
didn't
just
try
to
sell
me
the
most
expensive
version.
Delivery
was
really
fast
and
the
product
seems
to
be
A1
(I'm
not
a
musician).
Would
definately
use
them
again.
Never
ever
had
a
problem
with
ordering.

When
we
order
something
this
is
not
the
place
that
seems
to
lag
on
having
things
that
you
really
need.
I
will
order
from
Mr.
Chewy
again.

It
was
fast,
easy,
and
no
problems.
Easy
to
find
any
part!
Wrong

I
ordered

not

in

I

about

I
was

and

I
wanted
to

at.
I
made
my

and
much
to
my
surprise,
everything
was
delivered
that

After
220,000
miles,
my
'97
Expedition
is
still
working
like
a
charm,
but
with
a
few
visible
signs
of
age.
One
of
those
is
a
missing
lug
cover
on
one
wheel,
which
sells
for
upwards
of
$80
from
the
dealer,
but
only
$21
from
the
parts
geeks.
So
I
bought
it.
Mistake.
I
got
a
cheap
Taiwanese
knockoff
that
was
inferior
in
every
way
when
matched
up
to
the
original
remaining
covers,
most
notably
in
the
thickness
of
the
metal
clips
which
secure
it
to
the
lug
nuts.
I
installed
it
anyway,
flimsy
clips
and
all,
and
made
it
about
5
miles
before
it
popped
loose
and
was
pulverized
by
trafiic.
I
still
haven't
received
the
BMW
hood
grill
that
I
ordered
at
the
same
time,
but
am
going
to
look
at
it
a
lot
closer
than
the
wheel
cover
before
deciding
whether
to
install
it
or
send
it
back.
I'll
stop
at
the
Ford
deale
tomorrow
and
get
the
real
thing
for
the
Expedition,
a
little
money
lost,
but
a
lot
wiser.
I
was
very
pleased
with
the
easy
to
use
website
and
delivery
was
very
quick.

Curtains
were
great
and
look
a
treat!
The
skins
I
bought
for
my
kids
sansa
fuze
mp3
players
are
so
creative
and
were
totally
well
priced.

I
didn't
realize
they
were
stick-ons
until
they
arrived,
but
as
a
result
they
fit
like,
well,
skins!

Totally
amazing.

Highly
recommended.

A+
I
am
super
satisfied
with
my
experience
from
partsgeek!

They
had
the
right
part
(which
seemed
to
be
hard
to
find
for
the
particular
model
i
was
looking
for)
at
a
GREAT
price
and
the
shipping
was
super
fast,
especially
considering
it
was
free!

It
was
my
brothers
car
i
diagnosed
it
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
got
online
to
try
to
find
the
part
and
ordered
it
from
partsgeek
on
a
sunday
evening
and
was
greatly
surpised
that
the
right
part
showed
up
by
tuesday
afternoon
and
worked
wonderfully!

Like
i
said
Very
satisfied
and
will
definately
recommend
the
parts
and
services
to
others!

Thank
you
again
for
offering
a
great
part
at
a
great
price
and
getting
it
to
me
in
quick
orderly
fashion
even
with
the
standard
free
shipping!

a

and
an

They
were
all

than
I
could
find
anywhere
locally
or
even
online
here
in
the

Since
they
were
over
some

I
received

What
blew
me
away
was
that
this

Added
to
my
favorites,
will
give
them
first
shot
at
parts
I
need
from
here
on
out.
Parts
Geek
consistently
provides
competitive
pricing.
I
often
have
trouble
identifying
the
correct
part
on
your
website
because
you
do
not
reference
the
manufacturers
part
number.
This
creates
the
need
to
cross
reference
Parts
Geek's
number
with
the
manufacturers
number
before
I
place
my
order.
Parts
Geek
requires
that
I
contact
their
customer
service
by
e-mail.
Their
policy
is
to
provide
a
response
in
24
-
48
hours.
Normally
I
receive
a
response
in
48
hours
but
sometimes
it
takes
longer.
If
I
need
to
repair
a
car
I
can
not
wait
an
additional
48
hours
so
I
have
to
order
the
part
elsewhere.

I
would
prefer
being
able
to
communicate
with
someone
immediately
when
I
have
questions
about
a
part,
so
I
could
buy
more
parts
from
PG
or
the
better
solution
to
this
issue
for
PG
would
be
to
provide
the
manufacturers
sku
or
part
number.
This
would
minimize
their
customer
service
expenses
and
would
improve
the
accurracy
of
the
customer's
order.
This
would
minimize
the
expenses
incurred
when
customer's
return
parts.

I
paid
a
lot
extra
to
have
my
book
overnighted
bscause
a
friend
needed
it
for
an
exam.
I
chose
to
have
it
delivered
on
a
Wednesday
afternoon
using
FEDEX
overnight,
but
got
it
on
Thursday
morning
by
a
UPS
deliveryman.
Not
only
was
it
late,
it
was
vastly
different
than
what
I
had
wanted
(I
can't
stand
UPS,
they've
lost
and
delayed
several
of
my
and
my
friends'
shipments,
fedex
is
much
better).
I
don't
see
how
it
could
have
gotten
so
screwed
up,
and
that
day
made
a
different
to
my
friend--she
had
one
less
day
to
study
and
didn't
do
very
well
on
the
exam.
I'm
very
disappointed
with
the
service.
The
folks
at
Town
Fair
were
professional,
efficient
and
helpful.

They
tried
to
help
me
find
the
least
expensive
solution
to
my
problem
first.

Then
they
tried
to
help
me
ascertain
if
my
problem
was
covered
under
warranty.

Once
it
was
established
that
I
was
not
covered
under
a
warranty,
even
though
they
did
not
have
the
tire
in
stock
they
went
out
and
got
the
tire
from
another
location
and
installed
it
the
same
day.

The
guys
were
friendly
and
helpful,
I
would
definitely
recommend
Town
Fair
Tire.
The
products
that
I
bought
were
brilliant
just
as
it
said
in
the
description
and
the
price
was
also
very
good
but
the
packing
was
very
bad!
My
product
wasn't
protected
in
anyway
just
a
box
with
the
address
on
it
that's
all!
For
the
price
that
I
payed
for
my
product
I
really
did
expect
more
secure
packaging.

right,
and
was
delivered
quicklly.
For
this
particular
purchase
I
requested
a
discount
offer,
the
offer
didn't
load
to
my
order.
We
had
a
couple
of
questions
before
we
booked
the
cruise
&
paid
the
deposit
and
we
got
answers
within
hours
from
our
consultant
even
though
it
was
a
weekend.
We
are
very
excited
about
going
on
our
cruise.
I
can't
offer
a
view
on
prices
or
after-sales
service
(hence
only
four
stars)
but
I
needed
an
item
in
a
hurry,
ordered
on
Sunday
evening,
opted
for
Tuesday
delivery
and
sure
enough
my
order
turned
up
on
Tuesday.
Great
stuff!
I
should
say
also
that
the
packaging

was
minimal
but
sufficient
so
top
marks
for
eco-friendliness
too
-
other
suppliers
(nameless)
might
take
note.
PartsGeek.com
shipped
my
replacement
part
very
quickly,
however
it
wasn't
the
part
that
was
advertised.
It
still
worked,
however
it
was
of
inferior
quality
that
I
was
expecting.
Now,
my
problem
is
fixed,
however
had
I
known
the
part
I
ordered
was
of
lower
quality
I
would
have
spent
more
money
on
a
different
one.
We
have
bought
several
pieces
of
Oak
furniture
from
Pine
Solutions
and
this
will
fit
in
just
nice
in
our
bedroom.
Prices
were
very
good
and
the
free
delivery
came
much
faster
than
expected
which
was
an
awesome
surprise!

I
will
keep
buying
from
petflow.com!
Fast
transaction.
Less
than
a
week
from
ordering
to
sitting
on
my
doorstep.
Thanks
so
much.

I

As

Great

I'm

If

you're

I

Despite
a

due
to
a

issue/upgrade,
my

(PS3

arrived
in
two
working
days.
Very

provided

are

None

It's

it's

there

you

I

I
only
purchase
my
cabinets
from
Cabinet
Giant,
they
have
the
best
prices
on
great
quality
cabinets,
I
would
rather
choose
their
cabinets
than
my
own
suppliers.
Their
standard
quality
cabinets
look
great,
and
when
you
install
a
granite
counter
top
on
them,
you
cant
tell
if
they
are
$2,000
cabinets
or
$10,000
cabinets.
I
always
add
some
Blu-motion
soft
closer's
and
everyone
loves

Assembly
is
straight
forward
but
does
take
some
time,
honestly,
the
convenience
of
not
transporting
fully
assembled
cabinets
makes
the
assembly
worth
it.

I
just
purchased
2
window
regulators
from
the
EBAY
venue
where
prime
choice
auto
parts
was
the
supplier.

The
2
units
did
not
fit
exactly
as
claimed,
but
PCAP
customer
service
shipped
out
another
set
prior
to
sending
me
shipping
labels
for
the
return
of
the
original
units.

Once
I
got
the
replacements
into
the
car,
I
shipped
the
original
order
back
to
PCAP
and
they
paid
for
the
shipping.

What
a
class
organization
when
it
comes
to
customer
service.

I
continue
to
use
their

to
see
what

they
could

with.

I
mistakenly
ordered
a
single
bed,
when
I
believed
I
had
ordered
a
double.
I
didn't
realise
until
after
the
delivery.
When
I
contacted
Bedworld
to
exchange
it
for
a
double,
I
was
told
it
would
cost
me
another
£145
for
taking
the
single,
delivering
the
double,
and
the
extra
toward
a
double.
I
was
understandably
distracted,

as
I
had
been
staying
in
a
hotel
after
my
flat
was
repeatedly
flooded,
ruining
my
bed
too,
my

flat
was
uninhabitable
and
I
was
in
the
middle
of
moving
to
a
new
flat.
I
am
still
without
a
bed
and
have
had
no
help
whatsoever
from
Bedworld,
as
I
don't
have
£145
to
pay
for
18
inches
of
bed,
which
is
ridiculous.

Absoulely

I

They

Better

for

would
avoid
the
hassle
we
experienced
having
advised
a
'Do

that
was
totally
ignored.
Added

it

a

Popped

He
was
extremely

incredibly
helpful.
Explained
the
differences
between
different

how
they
worked,
offered
his
opinions
and
didn't
badger
us.
Very
patient

we
made

offered
some
fantastic

One

While
this

not
terribly
uncommon,
I
had
to
pay

at
my
own
expense
for
a
mistake
made
by
Parts

If
they
were
serious
about
customer

they
would
have
sent
the
correct
part
(not
hard
to
do)
and
had
the

take
what
they
had

sent.
Thanks
for
the

I
had
been
using
a
competitor
for
a
while,
but
after
experiencing
frustration
with
using
their
website
and
bonus
coupons,
slow
loading
of
pages,
and
very
slow
shipping
I
decided
to
switch.

PetFlow
does
not
always
have
the
cheapest
online
prices,
but
their
website
is
very
easy
to
navigate
when
I'm
in
a
hurry.

If
I
really
need
something,
if
they
can
keep
up
their
fast
service
then
I
will
continue
to
use
them.

Very
impressed
with
the
free
shipping,
too!
The
parts
I
orderd
were
new
and
very
inexpensive.They
were
also
delivered
within
a
few

Just
about

i

thing
i
buy
there.
Even
diamond

for
my

last

She
loved
them!
I
buy
online
and
in
the

Cant

I
dont
have
alot
of
extra

Ive
checked
out
multiple
web

for

SupplementWarehouse
has
the
best
prices
by
far.
I
found
other
sites
with
free
shipping
but
i
still
was
spending
more.
So
i
recommend
this
site
for
all
your
supplement
needs.
I
will
continue
to
shop
with
them!
Easy
and
good
deals
No
problems
with

I

the

was
very

and
the

was

I
would
like
to
pass
on
my
sincerest
thanks
for
what
can
only
be

as
an
extremely
pleasurable
and
pain
free
experience
dealing
with
your

I

a
part
for
2009
Nissan.
The

came
in
correctly,
in
good

and
very
quickly.
Price
was
very
reasonable
The
perfect

Their

their

Awesome

I
used
the
meet
and
greet
at
birmingham
airport
and
it
was
a
great
start
to
ensuring
that
we
got
into
the
airport
withpout
any
hassle
and
with
two
small
children
this
was
a
blessing.
Very
quick
delivery
via
courier.

Have
been
getting
bits
and
pieces
off
these
guys
for
a
few
years
through
friends
and
in
store.
Got
very
good
honest
advice
too
!

Had
the
wrong
flavour
of
protein
sent
to
me,
but
on
my
next
order
a
heap
of
freebies
were
thrown
in
which
was
greatly
appreciated!

Definately

recommend
to
a
friend.
EVERYTHING
WAS
FINE
BUT
DON'T
EXPECT
TO
EVER
SPEAK
TO
ANYONE.
Fast
delivery
from

was
greatly
appreciated
as

I

do
not
usually

but
ont
he
one
occasion
that
these
two
fields
combined,
I
found
this
site
very
useful
and
with
plenty
of
selection.
I
found
what
I
needed
and
was
kept
up
to
date
on
the
progress
of
my
order
throughout.
The
website
was
easy
to
use
and
understand
which
made
it
simple
to
find
what
i
was
looking
for.
The
prices
were
competitive
with
other
similar
websites
that
i
found.
The
delivery
was
amazingly
quick,
I
chose
not
to
have
the
prescription
checked,
placed
the
order
around
lunchtime
and
the
lenses
arrived
with
the
post
the
next
day.
Overall
very
happy
with
the
experience
and
would
definitely
recommend
to
a
friend.
I'd
order
again,
without
hesitation
or
reservation.
They
wouldn't
ship
to
me
because
I
had
different
shipping
and
billing
addresses.
I
told
them
it
had
to
be
this
way
because
no
one
is
home
to
sign
for
the
parts
and
they
went
ahead
and
canceled
the
order
rather
than
work
with
me
on
getting
this
resolved.
Kinda
sucks..
I
will
reccomend
this
company
to
anyone

at

half
price,

again
!
For
the
price
I
can't
fault
them
!
I
ordered
this
same
part
from
a
competitor,
and
it
took
2
1/2
weeks,
got
this
one
in
3
days!!
I
made
a
flight
change
and
was
told
about
a
$350
fee.
I
was
also
instructed
that
since
I
paid
for
insurance
that
if
I
filed
a
claim
I
would
be
reimbursed.
This
weighted
heavily
in
my
decision
to
change
my
flight.
I
felt
lied
to
and
misguided.
Now
I
will
be
financial
liable
for
those
fees.
Very
disappointed
that
I
was
not
speaking
with
a
travel
expert.
I
will
use
a
different
booking
service
next
time
which
will
be
in
a
few
weeks.
I
must
say
that
I
am
very
impressed
with
the
service
I
have
received.
I
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
anyone
to
this
site.

I
ordered
a
sweater
online
and
was
not
entirely
satisfied
with
the
quality
of
the
item.
It
did
not
appear
to
be
up
to
the
expected
standard
and
was
concerned
with
the
shape
of
the
top.
It
did
not
match
the
same
sweater
I
had
tried
on
in
store.
very
good
service
and
delivery.
Some
of
the
parts
I
ordered
were
good
but
one
did
not
show
one
was
bent
up
one
did
not
fit
and
one
was
half
of
a

I
filled

explaining

he
then
hung

I
tried
back
and
got
disconected
again.

Decided
to
put
under

Overall
I
wish
I
would
have
gone
with
one
of
the
many
local
parts
stores
they
ship
in
many
items
next
day
for
free
and
if
it
is
the
wrong
parts
you
bring
it
back.

The
difference
in
local
and
online
I
later
figured
to
be
a
few
bucks
defently
worth
it.
Ordered
parts
Sunday,
standard
shipping
and
had
them
in-hand
on
Tuesday.

Price
was

than

of
what
the

i
ordered
the
part
i
needed
and
it
came
in
a
timely
manner,
which
was
great.

but,
when
i
installed
the
part
it
did
not
work.

i
had
to
rush
around
to
find
a
replacement
and
do
the
work
on
my
wife's
car
at
10:00p
at
night.

was
not
happy
at
all
that
the
part
i
ordered
and
received
did
not
work
correctly.

this
experience
has
turned
me
off
and
i
will
not
order
from
them
again.

I
ordered
a
stock
wheel
for
my
3000GT
on
a
Wednesday
and
received
it
on
Friday!
How
cool
is
that?
I
am
a
customer
for
life.
I
had
a
discount
coupon
and
that's
the
only
reason
I
tried
this
site
over
competitor
pet
food
sites
I've
used
before.

But
even
with
that
discount,
I
still
got
hit
with
higher
shipping
charges
and
the
starting
price
of
the
dog
food
I
buy
was
higher
as
well.

The
product
shipped
fairly
quickly,
but
again,
I've
had
quicker
shipping
with
other
sites.

Overall,
I
had
no
problems
so
I
can't
say
anything
bad.
All
I
can
say
is
I've
had
better
experiences
ordering
from
other
pet
food
sites.
After
the

has
been
worth
every

and
every
minute.

The
few
times
I've
had
issues,
the
Wordpress
staff
has
solved
it
in
moments.

I
couldn't
ask
for
better
people.
I'm
pleased
with
the
great
convenience
of
ordering
on
line,
the
website
is
easy
to
navigate,
the
prices
and
quality
of
parts
is
surprisingly
goodq,
customer
service
has
been
very
helpfull,
unfortunately
I'm
still
waiting
to
receive
one
of
the
parts
I
ordered,
still
no
resolution.
I
have
ordered
twice
from
Herbies
totaling
11
seeds
and
they
have
all
sprouted
and
doing
well.

Shipping
was
stealthy
and
came
quickly.
We
reported
a
leak
in
the
unit
to
the
front
desk
staff
and
they
immediately
sent
a
message
to
the
DM.
We
were
told
it
would
be
about
3
days
to
fix
the
leak.
Over
a
week
went
by
and
still
the
leak
persisted
which
prevented
us
to
fully
use
our
storage
space.
We
were
kindly
offered
plastic
to
cover
our
things
by
the
front
desk,
but
honestly
this
is
not
an
acceptable
solution
since
we
are
paying
for
storage.

About
a
day
ago
I
was
called
by
Wendy
at
the
front
desk
and
told
that
your
people
were
on
site
fixing
the
leak.
I
went
by
today
-
it's
raining
-
and
the
leak
is
still
there.
I
just
called
the
front
desk
and
told
Wendy
about
the
leak
-
she
informed
me
that
she
would
immediately
inform
her
DM.
Because
of
this
I
will
more
than
likely
not
with
my
plan
of
renting
the
unit
for
next
few
months
and
instead
go
to
a
competitor
in
the
area.
Délais

I
did
a
lot
of
checking
around
to
find
the
best

on

I
needed
to
order
and
Bookbyte
was
the
best
overall
deal
out
there.
Nice

Delivered
on
time
,thanks
I've
ordered
from
supplementwarehouse.com
several
times
and
I
keep
going
back
because
they
have
the
best
value
around.

You
can
look
elsewhere
for
cheaper
supplements
but
I
haven't
found
a
better
deal
yet.
Good
price,
quality
and
fast
shippng.
The
Website
is
good,
but
after
I
had
ordered
there
was
a
break
down
in
communication
which
led
to
me
having
to
chase
up
my
order
by
phone
and
email
several
times.
The
trophy
was
delivered
finally
and
is
exactly
how
I
wanted
so
I'm
happy.
I
ordered
this
cycling
jersey
to
take
part
in
a
charity
cycle
ride.
I
didn't
want
to
spend
a
fortune
and
this
was
the
right
price.
Delivered
within
3
days
of
order.
Quick
delivery,
and
cheaper
than
anywhere
else.
Excellent
value
for
money,
and
excellent
service.
Really?
Need
I
say
more?
That
quality
of
the
work
is
great
just
wish
there
was
a
faster
way
to
place
a
order
they
usally
take
about
a
week
to
review
my
artwork
befor
i
can
even
place
a
order.
Once
im
approved
to
pay
it
ships
fast
which
is
good.
Exact

didn't
know
when

they
were
just
going

If

just

over
the

10
years

so,
even
visiting
their

at

They
stock
a

range
of
products
for
quiet
computing,
at
good
prices,
ship

quickly
&
with
reasonable

I've
never
needed
to
use
their
technical
support,
but
have
no
doubt
that
this
part
of
their
business
would
be
every

as
professional
as
the
rest.

No

Bestilte

Den
eneste

udfordring
jeg
havde
var
at

skulle
bruge
fakturaen,
og
der
gik
mere

en

inden
de
trak
pengene
og
fakturaen
havnede
i

Men
ellers
ganske
anbefalelsesværdigt
Super

stod

dagen
efter
bestilling,
jeg
fik
byttet
et
fejlkøb
uden

og
sparede
en
mindre
formue
da
god
maling
jo
normalt
er
p....
dyrt.
Og
så
kan
man
købe
fejltonet
maling
i
butikken
til
10kr/liter,
så
er
man
heldig
kan
man
male

Very
pleased
with
the
quality
of
the
product.
I
received
it
when
promised.
I
got
the
correct
part
at
a
great
price.

I
will
most
certainly
use
them
again
I
ordered
part's
on
Dec
15th
and
it's
now
the
28th
and
still
no
part's
and
you
want
to
know
how
you
did?
I
would
always
prefer
to
buy
from
a
local
store
but
great
prices
plus
faster
delivery
from
the
UK
to
my
door
in
Australia
than
an
online
store
in
the
same
country!
Cracking
service
highly
recommended
Both
Steve
and
Scott
were
very
helpful
--
Coming
from
CT
to
California
-
they
gave
me
great
insight
on
specific
locations
and
overall
general
logistics.
Always
deliver
immediately.
It
was
just
as
advertised,
and
I
received
it
very
quickly.


I
will
definitely
order
from
them
again.

Thank
you
for
a
reliable
alternative

the

You've
won
another
happy
customer
in
West
Fargo,
ND
No
problems
with
the
service
it
was
excellent.
I
was
in
the
market
for
an
IWC
and
I
had
gone
to
an
IWC
shop.

After,
trying
on
the
watch
and
picking
out
the
one
I
wanted
I
began
researching
the
best
prices.

After
a
week
or
so
of
in
person
and
online
price
and
reputation
of
dealer
research,
I
landed
on
LuxuryofWatches.com.
Not
only
was
their
price
the
lowest
I
found,
which
was
$1,300
cheaper
than
the
retail
price
tag,
but
they
also
had
good
ratings
and
feed
back.
I
felt
confident
after
reading
the
good
and
bad
feed
back
(very
few)
that
I
would
purchase
my
watch
from
them.

After
I
did
so,
the
watch
shipped
to
me
sooner
than
even
expected
and
I
couldn't
be
happier
with
my
watch
and
the
whole
experience!
I
would
definitely
consider
buying
my
next
watch
from
them.
And
at
the
moment
I
can't
think
of
a
reason
not
to.
Other
than
some
brief
confusion
finding
the
lot
at
the
end
of
winding
narrow
road
in
an
ugly
industrial
section,
we
had
a
great
experience.
Friendly
and
fast,
both
at
the
service
booth
and
in
shuttle
buses.

This
will
be
my
first
choice
next
time
I
fly
from
Newark.
Price
is
low
for
the
region,
but
not
the
absolute
cheapest.
Still,
the
service
is
worth
the
extra
buck
a
day.
When
I
need
a
fastener,
this
is
the
place
I
go.

Quick
response,
great
products.

Highly
recommended.
We
looked
at
several
websites
to
find
new
filters.

We
have
a
camper
and
had
problems
finding
locally
the
right
size
filter
for
the
A/C.

Dryers
price
and
availability
was
awesome.

Will
be
ordering
more
filters
as
we
need
them...
I
would
go
to
laptopscreen.com
for
all
my
screen
replacements.
They
give
a
fair
price
on
the
item
and
give
great
shipping
rates
especially
for
overnight
shipping.
pcgamesuppy.com
is
great!
I
use
it
to
buy
online
Playstation
networks
cards.
Its
great
because
you
receive
the
redeem
code
within
10
minutes
and
its
very
useful
to
me
because
the
nearest
store
to
buy
the
PSN
cards
is
1
hour
away
from
my
house,
so
pcgamesupply
is
much
faster
and
I
can
pay
with
paypal.
MCM,
did
their
part.
UPS
dropped
the
ball,
and
lost
my
shipment.
Two
days
late,
and
they
have
no
idea
where
it
is.
It's
was
easy
to
use
and
the
cheapest
airport
parking
I
can
find
this
time
(Purple
Parking).
Need
to
go
to
T4
at
Heathrow
but
the
search
came
out
with
all
the
available
car
parking.
We
booked
for
the
cheapest
one
but
only
found
out
later
that
they
won't
drop
us
at
T4.
It
would
be
good
if
the
search
engine
would
let
us
search
for
the
terminal
as
well
as
the
airport.
Ordered
part
on
Wednesday
had
it
Friday
I
have
used
Arguscarhire
twice
recently
for
car
rentals
in
Italy.

Both
times
they
have
offered
the
best
price,
better
even
than
my
usual
corporate
rate.
I
sent
a
fairly
low
pixel
image
and
wanted
an
A1
size
canvas
so
wasn't
expecting
it
to
be
brilliant.

But
it
arrived
quicker
than
promised,
carefully
packaged
and
of
great
quality.

It
looks
really
good
on
the
wall.
e've
just
done
a
round-the-world
trip
and
I
knew
if
I
kept
the
photos
on
the
computer
they
would
get
lost
with
the
millions
of
others.

It
was
a
good
discipline
to
reduce
the
number
of
photos
into
a
photobook,
choosing
only
the
best.

The
format
was
simple,
although
it
is
easier
if
you
also
open
up
a
folder
of
the
photos
on
your
computer
so
you
can
select
them
from
a
bigger
preview
than
the
software
offers.
Trouble
free
delivery
and
better
price
than
direct
from
the
company.
Thanks

bene,consigliato
Excellent
service
I
had
some
problems
with
them
but
i
figured
they
had
nothing
to
do
and
i
was
angry.Now
i
realize
that
it
is
a
trustworthy
and
competent
website
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
gift
cards!!
the

is

whilst

above
all
it
is
their

Fantastic
service,
great

and
price.
Really
can't
fault
this
product
or
the
company
that
supplied
it!
Good
products,
cheap,
fast
and
efficient
–
what
more
can
I
say,
except
that
as
a
returning
fisherman
after
30
years
absence,
my
knowledge
was
more
than
a
little
rusty
...
So
the
friendly
detailed
helpful
descriptions
of
all
the
products,
what
they
were
for
and
how
to
use
them
was
invaluable
in
helping
me
make
rational
choices.
Thank
you.
Top

NEXT

why
but
it's
a
nice
touch).
Worked
without

Great

Very
polite

Only
wished
I
had
started
using
them
earlier..Good
deal.
Excellent
at

and
filling
them
correctly.
A

well
made

Would
recommend
this
company
to
any
one.

I
will
always
look
at
them
first
for
any
parts...

Very

The

Been
shopping
with

for
a
while

and
all
I

is
wow

are
the

out
there.

,seriously
can't
believe
iv
only
just
started
shopping
with
them
this
year
as
I
won't
be
shopping
anywhere
else
.
Good
value
for
money,
extensive
catalogue
of
products
(some
increasingly
hard
to
find
on
the
High
Street)
and
a
well-laid
out
website
made
ordering
easy
and
straight-forward.
Delivery
was
quick,
packaging
solid
but
not
excessive
-
it
even
came
with
a
free
pen:
what
more
needs
to
be
said?
I'll
be
using
them
again
and
recommending
them,
too.
Purchased
a
Christmas
tree,
product
Number
FL-1724,
after
reading
the
description
on
the
web
site,
6
feet
tall
and
100Cm
wide.
This
tree
was
neither
!!
it
was
more
like
5'10
in
height
and
80Cm
wide
as
I
measured
it
with
two
measuring
tapes.
Ordered
a
blower
fan
resistor
for
my
'06
Tacoma
on
Jan
14th
and
received
on
the
18th.
The
part
was
an
original
Toyota
Factory
part.
It
was
securely
packaged
in
a
UPS
Express
Pad
Pack
and
also
placed
in
a
cardboard
carton.

Perfect
fit
&
solved
my
heater
fan
problem.
Can't
beat
the
price
or
the
service.
I'll
definitely
order
from
PartsGeek
again.
This
is
very
fast
and
efficient.
Very
easy
to
follow
and
get
the
serial
I
paid
for.
Yup!
I
have
placed
a
number
of
orders
over
the
past
years
and
Floraqueen
has
always
delivered
on
time
and
with
beautiful
flowers
and
gifts.
Their
arrangements
and
flowers
look
superior
and
are
long
lasting.
Would
do
again.
Very
fast
delivery,
part
was
as
described.
But
was
not
informed
of
the
process
of
obtaining
my
core
refund.
took
way
too
long
and
cost
me
28.00
to
get
my
50.00
back.
It
was
good.
comfortable,
convenient.
We
enjoyed
it
a
lot.
The
place
was
nice,
location
was
good,
affordable
and
economical.
Good
selection,
very
fast
delivery,
you
guys
have
a
new
customer
for
life!
I
ordered
them
with
the
expectation
of
getting
the
pearls
here
for
my
wife
by
Christmas,
but
UPS
didn't
live
up
to
their
next
day
air
service
(it
was
3
days
late).

I
understand
they
had
problems
all
over
the
place,
but
a
guarantee
is
a
guarantee.

I
complained
to
them
and
all
I
got
was,
sorry,
but
unless
your
dealership
where
you
purchased
the
pearls
puts
in
a
complaint,
we
cannot
reimburse
you
for
the
next
day
air.
From
ordering
on
line

to
the
delivery,
I
find
the
whole
process
easy
and
convenient.
Great
selection
Best
place
for
photo
stuff!
Purchased
full
kilt
outfit
for
my
wedding
on
14.12.2012
-
wanted
the
casual
kilt
look
with
the
ghilly
shirt
-
what
can
I
say
-
was
surprised
by
the
superb
quality
of
the
full
outfit
-
looks
just
like
I
expected.
I
love
onnits
products,
I
have
recommended
to
friends.
Even
tho
some
of
their
products
are
a
little
over
priced
I
still
love
what
they
offer.
And
their
customer
service
is
great
and
never
have
a
problem
with
getting
deliveries
on
time.
Simply
put,
every
onnit
product
I've
tried
thus
far,
has
met
or
exceeded
the
claims
by
their
company.
If
you're
looking
for
great
prices
on
mainline
bike
parts
Merlin
is
the
place
to
shop.But
what
impresses
me
most
is
the
quality
of
service.I
have
on
some
occasions
ordered
at
4-45
pm,and
still
received
my
order
the
following
morning.I
have
been
a
customer
for
approx
5
years
and
spent
thousands(no
exaggeration)
and
the
only
time
I
had
a
problem
it
was
dealt
with
speedily
and
to
my
satisfaction.I
have
often
emailed
for
advice
and
always
had
a
speedy
reply.Merlin
is
the
example
all
mail
order
companies
shoud
follow.Sadly
very
few
do!
I've
spent
many
thousands
of
dollars
with
this
company
and
most
of
the
time
they've
shipped
the
right
part.

I
ordered
a
heavy
part
that
the
site
claims
would
fit
my
car
and
it
is
beyond
any
doubt,
the
wrong
part
for
my
car.
Easy
to
access
and
easy
to
order.

Prices
very
competitive.
I
bought
a
ticket
$1020
based
on
the
marketing
message
"best
price
guaranteed".
the
trip
was
for
almost
2m1/2
my
fault.
I
had
in
mind
I
can't
go
wrong.
I've
checked
before
and
see
price
for
about
$250
less.
Well,
few
days
later,
I've
checked
and
see
the
price
was
back
to
about
$750.
I
called
the
customer
and
try
to
get
the
difference
back.
So
first,
got
answer
within
the
few
minutes
(
hence
the
3
stars).
The
person
explained
me
that
the
best
price
guaranteed
is
only
for
the
very
exact
same
flight
-not
with
different
airline
-
and
within
the
same
24-26hours.
so
something
I
got
from
other
travel
agency
already
like
travelocity
(
they
charged
me
$6-7
something
plus
tax)
or
sometime
free.
Most
of
the
time,
I
read
terms
and
conditions.
just
taht
I
was
too
busy..
Swift
Delivery,
Good
Value
what
else
is
there
to
say
I
was
very
confident
in
this
storage
company
after
my
dealings
went
so
smoothly.
Professional,
polite,
and
fulfilled
all
my
needs.
I
got
a
super
clean
unit
at
a
very
affordable
price.
Hands
down
the
best.
If
you're
looking
for
storage,
then
look
no
further.
Best
of
all,
first
month's
rent
was
free.
I
recently
purchased
2
pairs
of
Astro
trainers,
both
were
delivered
promptly
however
one
pair
were
a
poor
fit.
I
returned
these
by
post
on
saturday
requesting
a
larger
size
replacement
which
I
received
by
the
following
Thursday
in
time
for
Saturdays
game.
Great
service!
STG's
knowledgable
staff
provides
an
excellent
service
pre
and
post
purchase.
Great
price,
fast
shipping,
will
definitely
buy
from
again.
It
took
almost
a
day
to
get
my
keys,
which
is
far
from
the
instant
delivery
claimed
on
the
site,
but
within
the
24
hour
maximum.

If
it
didn't
say
"Instant
Delivery"
I
wouldn't
complain.

As
it
is,
that's
the
only
black
mark
on
the
site.

I've
bought
3
keys
and
all
worked
great
and
were
as
cheap
as
I
could
find
anywhere.
I
ordered
a
Borderlands
2
key
and
got
it
almost
instantly!

A
few
hours
later
after
bragging
to
a
friend
about
it,
he
decided
he
wanted
one
two.

He
tried
to
setup
everything,
but
in
the
end
he
got
bogged
down
in
all
the
Anti-Fraud
protection.

So,
he
sent
me
the
money,
and
I
ordered
one
for
him.

All
of
a
sudden,
I
got
hit
with
the
same
Anti-Fraud
crap.

This
is
AFTER
I
successfully
completed
an
order.

You
need
a
picture
of
my
ID?

Seriously?

I'm
using
PayPal.

They
have
consumer/merchant
protection
built
in.

Even
after
complying
to
this
ridiculous
request,
it
still
took
over
24
hours
to
get
my
key.

Oh,
and
to
top
it
all
off,
they
didn't
cancel
my
friend's
first
order
as
he
requested,
so
he
ended
up
with
two
keys
instead
of
one.

Maybe
now
that
everything
is
setup,
I
won't
have
this
issue
anymore,
but
it
was
really
a
pain
getting
to
this
point.

I'm
likely
to
give
them
another
chance
in
the
future,
but
if
this
happens
again,
I'll
start
going
somewhere
else.
This
process
was
quick,
easy
and
shame
free.
I
did
it
right
from
my
smart
phone.
Good
company
with
fast
service
and
pleasant
CR.

Would
use
again
without
hesitation.
My
order
arrived
really
quickly
and
once
again,
Animed
Direct
offered
the
best
price
for
what
I
wanted.
My
order
arrived
really
quickly
&
in
good
condition.
It

I
could
find.
I
ordered

really
quickly.
I

I
initially
tried

to
see
which
would

for

Cash4Books.net
offered
the

for
it
and
to
top
it
of,
they
even
threw

I
would
recommend
them
to
any
one.

easy

Can't
beat
the

This
is

if
anything
they
are

than
the
first.

I
ordered
a
replacement
passenger
mirror
for
a
2004
Subaru
Outback.

The
backing
plate
was
defectively
manufactured.

The
sockets
were
the
balls
on
the
actuator
arms
are
supposed
to
snap
in
were
made
for
show
only.

They
weren't
even
close
to
being
functional
and
allowing
the
parts
to
snap
in
place.

As
manufactured,
the
mirror
would
not
be
able
to
be
adjusted
and
would
flop
around.

This
caused
me
to
have
to
use
the
old
backing
plate
with
the
new
glass.

Only
problem
was
that
the
glass
was
not
made
to
specifications
of
original
glass
so
it
did
not
fit.

Required
lots
of
prying,
scraping
and
filing
to
get
the
mirror
glass
to
fit.

A

With
all
the
products
available
and
the
cheapest
prices
around,
it's
foolish
to
get
supps
anywhere
else.
Been
shopping
with
them
for
years
now
and
any
questions
or
order

are
responded
to
in
a
timely
manner.
I
was
very
impresssed
to

If

Using
hostels.com
is
awesome,
for
me
the
greatest
value
it
provides
is
convenience
and
ease
of
use.
I
frequently
book
my
next
stay
either
day
of
or
one-day
ahead.
All
of
the
relevant
information
is
easily
accessible,
and
I
can
search
for
the
hostel
that
will
suit
me
best,
it
doesn't
matter
if
location,
price,
availability,
reviews,
etc.
are
your
priority,
you
can
easily
toggle
between
categories
and
make
comparisons
between
hostels
in
the
area.
Not
only
that,
but
you
don't
pay
the
full
price
until
you
arrive
and
once
you
become
a
member
you
don't
need
to
pay
a
service
charge!
This
should
definitely
be
the
go
to
site
for
all
travelers.
You
hear
all

of
horror
stories
about
people

I
have
used
multiple
websites
over
the
years
to
purchases
supplements.

It
seems
like
Supplement
Warehouse
is
the
only
website
that
is
a
one
stop
shop
for
all
of
my
supplements!

The
prices
are
lower
than
any
other
website
(and
if
they
are
not
they
will
match
the
other
website)
and
the
shipping
is
fast.
Easy
to
use.
Good
service.
Good
deals.
After
purchasing
a
pair
of
j
shoes
boots
from
another
company
they
arrived
damaged...
I
needed
a
replacement
pair
but
it
was
their
last
pair.

I
looked
online
and
found
that
country
attire
stocked
the
same
boots..however
I
was
leaving
for
Canada
in
a
matter
of
days
and
explained
to
the
guy
that
I
needed
them
fast
and
to
double
check
the
condition
of
the
boots
before
sending
out.
The
service
was
second
to
none
and
the
perfect
condition
boots
arrived
the
very
next
day.
Four
words
to
explain
country
attire...'Absolutely
top
class
company'

Thanks
again
:)
I
would
highly
recommend
this
seller
nothing
seems
too
much
trouble
for
the
competent
staff
without
being
overbearing.
Always
great
selection,
price
&
service
and
shipping
is
free
about
half
the
time.
They
send
you
the
correct

it
right
away.

I
will
go

again
for

I've
ordered
a
number
of
products
from

ShopTo.net
all
i
can
say
is
they
are
the
best
i
have
dealt
with,
they
have
competitive
prices
and
delivery
is
next
to
none.
Incredibly
pleased
with
the
service
of
this
company
and
I
will
continue
to
use
them
in
the
future
AND
recommend
them
to
who
i
can.
I
would
recommend
this
service
to
anyone
and
EVERYONE
-
without
hesitation
I
would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone.
The
product
I
ordered
was
delivered
on
time
and
was
the
specific
product
I
wanted.
Heinnie
Haynes
in
my
opinion
are
the
best.
No
other
company
selling
simular
items
(Survival,
outdoors,
etc...)
come
close.
Their
shipping
is
amazingly
fast
and
usually
free
as
I
tend
to
buy
enough
stuff
to
put
me
over
the
free
shipping
quota.
Purchased
an
indicator
unit
from
design911.
The
shipment
was
very

as
the

The
online
ordering
was
simple
and
advice
given
by

was
good.

not

them.
Phoned

I
live
just
down
the
street
from
them,
and
feel
welcomed
and
taken
care
of
every
time
I
pop
into
the
store.
They
always
give
me
great
deals,
and
are
just
super
good
people.
They
are
probably
part
of
the
reason
why
I
am
addicted
to
the
track,
I
don't
know
if
I
would
have
gotten
as
into
it
if
I
hadn't
been
to
their
shop
and
talked
to
their
guys.

Great
service
&
Great
price
Very
easy
to
use
and
great
choice
of
accommodation
options.
Was
a
great
experience
The
pick
up
in
Civitavecchia
was
an
easy
walk
from
the
cruise
port.

The
lady
working
the
counter
was
nice.

We
arrived
early
and
needed
to
wait
1.5
hrs
due
to
the
definitive
drop
off
time
needed.

It
would
have
been
nice
to
have
a
map
of
the
pick
up
city
and
drop
off
point
as
we
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
locating
the
drop
off
in
Rome.

There
is
no
name
on
the
outside
of
the
building
and
it
is
actually
inside
the
train
station.

This
should
be
noted
on
the
rental
contract
as
we
drove
around
the
Termini
Train
station
for
over
an
hour
trying
to
find
the
drop
off.

If
we
had
not
been
a
pair
(one
to
stay
with
the
car
and
one
to
go
in
checking
for
the
location)
it
would
have
been
difficult
with
police
telling
us
we
could
not
park
at
the
curb.

The
counter
rep
told
me
to
just
double
park
and
bring
in
the
keys.

The
car
was
as
promised
a
Fiat
500
with
good
gas
mileage
and
enough
room
for
2
and
2
large
suitcases.
We
were
advised
that
the
delivery
would
take
place
on
a
specific
day
but
not
advised
the
delivery
would
arrive
at
5.45am!
I
continue
to
purchase
hard

for
my

far,
I've
not

any

also
very

with
the

frame
in
which
my

are

You!

Quality

amazing

I'd
never

During

1
item
arrived
incorrectly
and
this
was
dealt
with
swiftly
by
Merlin

who
were
very
apologetic
on

I
have
used
them
before

will
continue

I

several

I
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
items
I
wanted
were
reasonably
priced.

I
ordered
them
and
they
came
very
quickly.

The
quality
of
the
product
was
excellent.

I
would
highly
recommend
this

to
everyone.
The
experience
of
buying
my

from

was
great.
The

I

were
waiting

I
arrived
at

and
there
was
plenty
of

letting
me

Will
I

Definitely!!

I've
been
using
Onnit
for
years
and
their
customer
service
is
great.
This
is
one
of
the
most
transparent
companies
I've
ever
given
my
money
to
and
they
never

Car
and
service
were
good.

I
was
charged
an
additional
$30
at
the
pickup
point
in
UK
which
I
thoughtwas
a
little
excessive.
I
found
the
web

easy
to

I
ordered
the

6

Not

If

they
take

The

On
8/28/12
I
ordered
a
clutch
kit
(05-902
luk)
and
was
blocked
from
checking
to
verify
the
order
so
I
backed
into
your
web
site
to
see
if
it
was
order.
In
doing
this
2
times
3
kits
were
ordered.
The
next
morning
i
checked
the
e-mail
and
found
3
clutch
kits
were
ordered.
I
tried
to
cancel
2
of
the
kits,
but
i
couldnot
cancel
the
kits.

I
receive
the
kits
(3),
but
used
only
1
kit
and
the
other
2
were
returned
on
UPS
.
I
hope
to
receive
full
credit
on
the
2
kits
that
were
returned
and
not
charged
a
restocking
fee
on
this
order!
I
have
used
PartsGeek
several
times
in
the
past
year
and
I
have
been
more
than
pleased
with
the
products
I
received
and
the
prices
are
great.
Easy
to
order.
PartsGeek
is
a
great
site
for
parts.
I
needed
to
book
a
room
while
working
away
and
went
to
Easytobook
where
I
was
given
a
price
of
£74.17.


When
the
transactiuon
was
completed
the
charge
had
increased
to
£89.00.


The
added
amounts
were
for
Taxes
and
Fees.


This
is
not
good
as
I
expected
to
pay
£74.17.


Perhaps
because
I
was
using
a
tablet
to
book
the
hotel
the
extra
fees
were
not
shown
clearly
before
booking
but
I
have
never
had
the
cost
shown
in
the
past
excluding
taxes
etc.


I
was
not
very
happy
Battery

provides
a
rapid

service.
The
goods
I
ordered
arrived
the
very
next
day.
The
batteries
were

of
excellent
value
and
beat
all
the
competition
on
the
internet.
I
would
highly
recommend
Batter

to
you.
I
would
highly
recommend
"Worldofsolar"
to

Their
website
is
well
set
out
and
their
customer
service
is
absolutely
brilliant.
The
product
arrived
quickly
and
was
of
superior
quality.
A
brilliant
firm
with
an
aim
to
please.

I
even
made
a
mistake
at
the
checkout
and
didn't
enter
a
discount
code.
When
they
realised
my
error
they
refunded
the
discount
off
the
bill
and
put
it
back
onto
my
card
!
!

What
can
I
say
about
the
firm?
They'
like
a
bright
star
in
the
sky,
out
of
this
world.
THE
BEST.
I
have
ordered
2
times
now
from
Parts
Geek
and
it
has
been
great.
The
only
part
I
had
this
time
is
that
I
got
charged
and
extra
$36.97
for
some
kind
of
insurance
or
shipping
stuff
that
I
did
not
ordered
and
another

$12.97
to
my
account
for
free
shipping
witch
I
already
got
charge
my
$8.95
shipping
for
for
the

wiper
I
ordered.
I
got
my
$36.97
returned
and
the
lady
was
very
apologetic,
but
when
I
called
the
number
for
the
$12.97
a
month
for
free
shipping,
the
man
said
that
it
was
too
late,
and
that
I
had
signed
in
for
it.
Mind
you
if
said
if
you
want
to
join
the
club
for

No
were
did
I
see
that
I
would
have
to
pay
an
extra
$12.97
a
month
for
shipping
when
both
times
that
I
have
ordered
I
got
charge
$8.95.
And
all
of
these
charges
came
out
of
my
account
without
me
knowing.
I
told
the
gentlemen
that
I
spoke
with
that
I
would
not
do
buissness
with
Parts
Geek.com
anymore
if
this
is
the
way
that
they
would
treat
their
customers.
For
that
reason
I
only
rated
a
3
Star,
other
wise
it
would
have
been
a
5
Star.
I
love
the
price
matching.

And
all
the
free
samples
available!!

Lowest
prices
and
fast
delivery.

It's
like
Christmas
morning
when
my
package
arrives!

I
can't
wait
to
look
at
all
my
free
samples!!
Researched,
ordered
the
parts
and
received
a
good
price
all
in
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes.

The
parts
arrived
as
advertised
in
good
condition
and
my
vacuum
is
running
like
new

That
s
all
I
ask
for
these
days.
I
have
been
buying
from
B&H
for
many
years
and
have
always
had
good
service.
I
bought

The

The
first
two
transfers
I
have
tried
worked
fine.
Being
new
to
this
service
I
was
unsure
about
the
IBAN
number
inputs
as
there
was
no
guidance
showing
what
format
it
should
be
entered
as
(with
gaps
or
hyphens
or
only
numbers
without
gaps)
so
had
to
wait
for
recipient
to
confirm
they
had
received
the
transfer
OK
.
This
took
a
little
while
so
it
was
an
anxious
wait
until
receipt
was
confirmed.
Some
more
guidance
or
confirmation
that
the
input
formats
were
acceptable
would
have
been
useful.
Rate
seems
competitive
so
happy
to
continue
using
this
service.

My

and

were
easy

was

I
received

earlier

I
anticipated.
Due

as
it
was

I

My

spent
a
semester
in
Scotland
and
she
recommended
that
my
wife
and
I
use
House
Trip
for
a
recent
trip
to
Paris.
I
was
a
bit
skeptical,
but
thankfully
she
convinced
us
to
give
it
a
try.
It
exceeded
all
of
my
expectations!
We
had
a
hassle
free
visit,
great
service,
and
even
saved
some
money
in
the
process.
We
were
able
to
find
an
apartment
in
Paris
that
wound
up
costing
us
less
than
half
of
what
I
would
have
spent
on
hotel
for
twice
the
space
and
service.
I
cannot
get
over
how
easy
it
was
to
do,
and
how
wonderful
our
experience
was.
Their
support,
through
the
web,
by
email,
and
by
text
was
superior,
and
we
never
had
a
problem!

I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
I've

a

recommended
to
me,
near

that
I
should
try

I
can
only
speak
from
my

what
I
can
safely
say
is
they
are
a

range
of
beko
appliances
for
the
kitchen
over
the
last
year
and
all
were
delivered
on
time
and
as
described.
Pre
delivery
information
and
follow
up
was
excellent.
The
website
is
excellent
too.
_I
give
partsgeek
an
A+
and
the
USPS
a
D.
It
took
them
10
days
NY
to
FLA
Needed
the
item
Quick.
Merlin
is
always
a
go
to
shop.
They
had
the
best
price
in
the
UK
and
it
arrived
in
a
couple
of
days.
I
tell
everyone
I
meet
about
B&H.

I
will
Google
what
I
want
and
look
for
the
lowest
price
I
can
find.

While
B&H
may
not
always
be
the
lowest
price,
they
are
always
among
the
lowest
price
of
reputable
online
retailers,
so
I
almost
always
choose
the
B&H
option.

Add
to
that
the
fast
shipping,
and
well
designed
site;
and
you
get
a
fabulous
experience.

The
have
a
great
selection
as
well.

They
have
everything
I
need
when
I
need
it
at
a
great
price!
Have
used
the
service
4
times
to
send
flowers
to
Germany.
On
only
one
occasion
were
they
delivered
on
the
prearranged
date.
But
their
customer
service
was
courteous,
helpful,
and
did
solve
the
problems.
Ordered
a
few
skinz,
but
main
reason
for
buying
was
to
add
a
cover
to
my
partners
new
kindle
keyboard,
she's
thrilled
with
the
stripey
skin
as
it
goes
with
her
case
for
it.

Very
happy
with
the
purchase
and
would
use
again.
I
never
received
the
part.
Post
office
did
not
deliver
,
they
sent

part
back
without
my
permission.
Filled
out
form
at
parts
geek
no
response
to
my
complaint.
As
this
order
required
a
prescription
from
the
vet
I
thought
the
transaction
would
be
quite
tiresome
but
it
was
very
straight
forward.
Medication
delivered
on
time
and
in
good
order
I
was
first
aware
of
Regency
Poultry
when
looking
on
e-bay
for
accessories,
foods
and
information,
to
help
me
with
the
new
bantam
chicks
I
have
just
hatched.
E-bay
led
me
to
Regency's
own
web
site,
which
I
found
very
user
friendly,
had
a
good
selection
of
the
items
that
I
was
interested
in
purchasing
and
at
very
competitive
prices,
plus
they
were
very
fair
when
it
came
to
calculating
the
postage
and
packing.
The
delivery
was
very
prompt
and
most

of
the
goods
were
well
packed,
except
for
the
book
that
made
up
part
of
the
order.
It
had
been
placed
loose
among
the
rest
of
the
goods
and
the
outer
protective
sleeve
had
become
creased
and
slightly
torn,
which
I
feel
could
have
been
avoided
if
the
book
had
been
wrapped,
if
only
in
newspaper,
and
laid
flat.
Apart
from
that
I
was
most
satisfied
with
their
service
and
would
not
hesitate
to
use
them
again.
Excellent
service,
needed
to
use
a
gift
voucher
as
well
as
a
discount.
Unable
to
input
online
but
a
quick
phone
call
to
customer
services
soon
resolved
that.
Best
price
and
super
quick
delivery.
Faultless
Despite
the
Gung
ho
attitude,
they
were
the
only
one
of
5
suppliers
i
contacted
that
got
it
right
!
whether
it
was
a
quote
for
the
wrong
car
or
the
wrong
engine
or
the
wrong
terms
or
the
wrong
price,
Central
made
the
effort
and
spent
the
time
to
get
my
business
I
bought
kettlebells
from
Onnit
mainly
because
I
wanted
to
ensure
I
received
a
quality
product.

The
prices
themselves
aren't
high,
but
the
factoring
in
the
shipping
costs
and
it
became
a
purchase
that
I
almost
didn't
make.

In
the
end,
I
went
with
Onnit
to
ensure
a
quality
product,
rather
than
through
Amazon
with
a
brand
I
don't
know
or
can't
make
contact
with.
The
TV
I
ordered
was
sold
out.
I
received
an
email
and
a
phone
call
from
WWS
next
day
assuring
me
that
my
TV
will
be
delivered
as
ordered.
The
CS
was
very
good
addressing
the
issue
and
my
order
was
shipped
two
days
later
and
arrived
on
schedule.
They
honored
great
price
they
had
during
their
sale
and
I'm
very
satisfied
how
they
handled
everything.
Like
clock
work
Purchased
a
relay
for
77
dollars,
bought
express
delivery.
5
hours
later
get
a
email
confirmation
saying
they
canceled
my
order
not
in
stock.
Should
not
have
shown
available
if
it
wasnt.
I
bought
a
power
steering
rack
and
sent
in
my
old
rack
for
a
core
charge,
$105.

The
rack
from
Partsgeek
failed
after
only
3,000miles
and
to
get
a
refund
I
have
to
send
in
the
rack,
but
Partsgeek
will
not
return
my
core
or
the
corecharge.

So
now
Partsgeek
has
two
cores
(my
original
one
and
the
one
I
bought
from
them)
and
I
have
none.
I'll
have
to
pay
the
core
charge
to
purchase
another
power
steering
rack
anywhere,
including
from
Partsgeek!
Beware
if
you're
buying
anything
with
a
core
charge.
They'll
rip
you
off.
This
is
the
second
time
I
have
purchased
product
from
Cult
Pens
and
again
the
whole
process
was
again
easy
and
smooth.
Great
place
to
source
those
hard
to
find
good
quality
products
not
available
in
the
high
street.
The
service
was
fantastic
and
the
people
I
spoke
with
were
polite
and
professional.
I
couldnt
be
happier.
you
just
made
a
customer
for
life
thank
you.
Order
shipped
was
incorrect
-
Not
even
close
to
ordered

number
or
correct
vehicle
Auto
lenders
is
a
great
dealer
for
buying
high
quality,
slightly
"used"
cars.

Their
salespeople
are
extremely
thorough
and
professional.

And
not
the
least
bit
"pushy".

Anthony
Russo
at
the
toms
river
nj
store
in
particular
was
excellent.

In
addition,
the
branch
manager
Brian
was
very
attentive
and
responsive.

Even
their
finance
manager
was
easy
to
work
with.

The
whole
buying
process
was
a
pleasure.

I
will
definitely
be
buying
from
them
again.
I
bought
karma
koin
cards
from
pcgamesupply
and
it
was
easy
fast
and
very
convenient.
Never
having
heard
of
the
site
before
we
were
a
bit
skeptical
but
it
worked
out
great,
amazing
deal
for
the
car/location.
Drop
your
car
outside
your
terminal.
Within
10
mins

I
am
very
happy
with
Big
Bus
tour.

Actually
my
family
also
is
very
happy
and
they
want
to
make
it
next
time
we
come
back
to
London.
There
was
one
item
that
wasn't
as
exactly
as
described,
inexpensive,
but
I
let
it
ride.
This
was
the
second
time
I've
booked
with
Argus
Car
Hire
&
the
service
&
price
were
fantastic,
I
wouldn't
hesitate
to
use
them
again.
I
also
have
an
annual
policy
for
any
excess
applied
by
the
hire
company
which
trims
your
costs
even
more
&
gives
you
complete
peace
of
mind.
Quick
and
simple
online
purchase
and
the
marker
pens
ordered
were
delivered
within
48
hours.
In
time
for
me
to
use
on
a
Train
the
Trainer
programme
I
was
delivering.
BoilerJuice
is
a
first
class
site
for
making
informed
decisions
about
where
to
buy
heating
oil.
The
site
is
easy
to
use
and
the
ordering
and
delivery
procedures
worked
like
clockwork.
Will
definitely
use
the
site
again.
No
hesitation
about
recommending
others
to
do
similarly.
This
was
my
first
order
placed
with
West
Coast
Shaving.
I
ordered
from
them
because
of
the
variety
of
products
offered
at
fair
prices.
The
order
was
shipped/delivered
on
time
with
products
ordered.
Based
on
this
order
experience
I
will
continue
to
order
my
wet
shaving
products
from
this
site
as
needed.
I
placed
an
order
for
a
K
&
N
intake
system
for
my
2010
Ford
F150
from
Partsgeek.com
the
other
day
and
I
couldn't
believe
how
great
the
prices
were.
Well
below
the
average
pricing.
The
delivery
was
quick
too.
I
will
continue
to
buy
from
them
for
my
auto
needs.
Thanks
Partsgeek.com!!!
Friendly
It
took
me
a
while
to
get
the
hang
of
it,
I
ordered
the
wrong
part,
and
too
expensive
to
send
back.

But
won't
happen
agains
Very
good
happy
with
knife
i
bought
I
paid
$29
for
a
part
that
would
of
costed
$180
at
autozone
and
the
delivery
was
good.
Yall
my
niggas
lol
The
mirror
was
the
exact
part
I
needed,
with
a
very
reasonable
price
tag
and
fast
delivery!
Thank
you
parts
geek.com
I
was
amazed.
I
bought
a
6.8kg
bag
of
Mutant
Mass
for
€70,
which
would
have
cost
me
€100
in
shops.
I
also
got
a
t-shirt
for
€5,
which
i
thought
would
just
rip,
but
I
wear
it
regularly
to
the
gym
and
have
gotten
my
use
out
of
it!
On
top
of
this,
I
was
given
a
free
shaker,
which
I
assumed
had
some
sort
of
catch..
But
there
were
no
strings
to
be
attached!
All
3
products
were
delivered
in
perfect
condition
with
a
smile
on
the
delivery
mans
face...
the
next
day!
As
we
have
a
holiday
home
in
France
we
particularly
appreciated
the
free
postage
of
goods
,upon
their
arrival
we
were
satisfied
withe
the
content,and
the
whole
deal
represented
good
value
for
money.
I
first
heard
about
Printing.com
from
an
individual
that
I
met
at
a
networking
meeting.
I
was
impressed
by
the
quality
of
the
card,
and
so
asked
the
person
where
she
had
had
her
cards
printed.
She
told
me
about
Printing.com.
I
have
been
an
online
customer
to
B&H
and
an
in-store
customer
during
my
years
in
NYC
for
a
decade
now.
I
have
used
many
other
camera
stores
as
well,
but
never
more
than
once.
Go
to
B&H,
you
will
be
satisfied.
Great
pricing,
honest
deals,
and
great
customer
service.
I've
used
Supplement
Warehouse
for
over
Two
Years
now
and
they
always
provide
me
with
great
prices
and
great
service.
I
primarily
get
Protein
Powder
and
Meal
Replacement
bars
from
them.
Best
prices
on
the
net!
I
cannot
believe
the
amount
of
material
I
learned
in
such
a
short
time.
I
don't
have
to
travel
anywhere
for
lessons
AND
it's
really
cheap.
A
win/win
all
around!
Fast
service,
excellent
product.
I've
purchased
three
pieces
from
'iCanvasArt'
and
am
very
pleased
with
them
all.
Managed
to
source
a
difficult
part
for
a
cooker.
The
item
arived
quickly
well
packaged
as
orered.
Would
have
giving
5
stars
if
they
had
more
selection
and
options
like

for
gift
boxing..
Outstanding
in
every
regard!
I
order
a
part
was
charged
264.85
then
a
week
later
got
another
email
stating
they
were
out
of
stock
and
the
order
was
canceled
but
never
got
refunded
and
can
not
get
ahold
of
them
on
the
phone
or
email.

Do
not
order
anything
from
them
now
I
am
disputing
it
with
my
credit
card
company.
Fantastic
service
got
battery
next
day
as
promised
good
value
for
money
I
had
problems
with
my
garage
door
opener.
There
was
no
suitable

in
the
local
stores
-
old

I
ordered
from
North
Shore,
received
it
much
sooner
than
I
hoped.
It
works
perfectly.
Ordered
A

very
fast

great
thank
you
Liked
the

end
the
ease
of
use,
no
problems
whatsoever
highly
recommend
Had
the
cheapest
price,
shipped
fast
and
the
part
fit
I'm
surprised
it's
legal
sometimes!!
I've
been
using
Priceline
for
12+
years
now
and
always
quite
satisfied
with
the
results
and
savings.
Nothing

tool.
Love
It.
Yesterday
my
first
ever
order
of
Hemp
Force
Protein
was
delivered.
I
ordered
the
choco
maca
and
acai
berry
combo
pack.
That
night
I
made
a
shake
with
just
the
choco
maca
and
water
and
it
was
delicious!
Tastes
like
liquid
brownies!
This
fat
kids
favorite!
I
can
only
imagine
how
good
the
recommended
shake
recipes
are
going
to
taste!
I'll
be
making
the
acai
berry
shake
with
water
for
lunch
today
at
work.
Can't
wait!
I
love
ONNIT
and
all
their
products!
I
can
barely
function
if
I
don't
take
my
Total
Primate
Care
(TPC)
night
and
day
packs!
Thanks
ONNIT!
Keep
up
the
excellent
work!
At
first
I
was
excited
to
order
from
Parts
Geek
with
all
the
incentives
of
fast
shipping
and
great
pricing.
Once
received
the
part
I
went
to
install
it
and
the
transmission
mount
was
made
incorrectly
and
caused
the
bolts
to
cross
thread
into
my
transmission....
It
was
a
design
flaw....
Now
i
not
only
have
the
wrong
part....
i
have
to
have
the
threads
re-tapped
by
a
machinist.

I
sent
parts
geek
and
"customer
support
ticket"
and
a
explanation
of
my
situation.
The
sent
me
an
RA
number
with
no
apology
and
stated
I
am
responsible
for
the
shipping
back....
After
trying
to
contact
them
by
phone.....
"Good
Luck"!

I
would
wait
10
min
on
the
phone
then
the
the
IRV
stated
i
should
fill
out
a
ticket
and
submit
it
via
internet
due
to
heavy
call
volume...hummmm
this
has
been
the
same
response
I
have
received
all
week.

I
would
then
submit
a
customer
support
ticket....MULTIPLE
times
...NO
RESPONSE!

I
briefly
explained
my
situation
and
asked
them
to
please
call
me
in
regards..etc.
and
left
my
contact
number.
I
have
worked
for
Home
Shopping
Network
Customer
Service
and
after
having
this
type
of
customer
service
I
WILL
NEVER
ORDER
FROM
PARTS
GEEK
AGAIN!
I
will
tell
everyone
the
same!
HORRIBLE
HORRIBLE
HORRIBLE
CUSTOMER
SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!
For
better
words..NO
CUSTOMER
SERVICE....
I
bought
Sleeping
Dogs
off
this
website.
I
hadn't
used
a
CD
Key
site
before
but
I
won't
be
buying
physical
copies
anymore.
Near
enough
instant
delivery
for
a
product
that
was
around
half
the
price
of
other
retailers.
I
previously
used
an
OBI
110
with
Google
voice.

Google
stopped
supporting
the
protocol
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
blessing
instead
of
a
headache.

The
tranfer
was
seemless
taking
less
than
5
mins
BEST
PRICES
AROUND!
Lots
of
free
stuff!!!!!!
I
CANT
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
A
THING!
REALLY
HAPPY
SO
FAR!
WITHOUT
A
DOUBT
RECOMMEND
THIS
WEBSITE!
Item
was
delivered
very
fast
and
as
described.
Recommended!

*****
Found
the
product
I
was
looking
for
on
the
website
with
just
a
couple
of
clicks.
No
pooling
around
with
out
your
products.
Great
product
just
as
we
had
expected,
with
quick
shipping.
excellent!!
Filters
for
my
Honewell
DR-90
humidifier
are
an
odd
size
that
can
only
be
gotten
from
Honeywell.
So
I
had
Air
Filters
Delivered
make
me
some
custom
filters.
They
fit
perfectly
and
cost
a
fraction
of
the
price
of
the
Honeywell
filter.
Everything
you
hope
for
on
holiday.
We
loved
it!
Easy
way
to
shop.
Packed
well
and
delivered
on
time.
Product
was
as
advertised.
I
booked
a
room
under
the
supposition
that
your
advertising
as
"lowest
online
room
rates"
was
actually
true,
but
was
sorely
disappointed.
The
Country
Inn
&
Suites
in
East
Troy,
Wisconsin
told
me
after
the
fact
that
they
could
have
booked
the
same
room
through
the
Country
Inn
website
for
$129.46
including
all
fees
and
taxes
by
using
my
AARP
discount.
Your
website
charged
me
$146.00
and
change
for
the
same
room.
Further,
the
response
to
my
email
requesting
the
AARP
discount
from
your
website
was,
in
essence,
that
I
had
to
work
out
that
discount
directly
with
the
hotel
location.
So
you
are
not
only
the
lowest
priced,
but
also
proceeded
to
pass
the
buck
and
claim
no
responsibility
when
I
gave
you
the
opportunity
to
actually
be
the
lowest
price
option.
I
will
avoid
ever
booking

Very

Parts
delivered
right

!!!!
Good
product
at
a
good
price
and
quick
delivery.
Has
all
the
parts
I
need
for
my
Jaguar
with
a
number
of
options
for
most
categories.

Parts
are
shipped
quickly.

Great
service.
Shipping
on
this
item
was
a
little
expensive
(but
isn't
everyone's
shipping
getting
expensive?)
but
the
product
was
exactly
what
I
needed,
good
value
and
arrived
in
a
timely
manner.

I
couldn't
ask
for
more
really.
I
have
used
Cabinet
Giant
for
several
home
remodels.

The
quality
is
great
and
they
are
easy
to
use.

Lots
of
available
selection.
Any
issues
that
I
have
had
have
been
resolved
quickly
and
professionally
!

Great
People
=
Great
Business
!

Keep
up
the
great
work.
Even
I
decide
to
buy
sports
goods
my
attention
to
go
this
site
because
they
always
have
the
good
offer
comparatively
other
companies.
Amazon.com
usually
has
great
prices
and
of
course
unbeatable
selection.
Both
software
products
-
MYPTuneUp
and
MYInternetSecurity
-
work
very
well.
They
are
easy
to
understand
and
use.
My
Windows
XP
Desktop
and
my
wife's
Windows
Vista
Laptop
are
working
faster,
more
smoothly,
and
with
greater
security
than
previously.
I've
worked
directly
with
technicians
Steve
and
Lyndon
with
immediately
positive
results.
They
called
promptly
as
scheduled,
and
kept
me
aware
every
step
of
the
way.
Lyndon
loaded
an
advance
copy
of
his
DEToolKit
which
is
a
big
help
in
doing
normal
maintenance
tasks.
I
highly
recommend
the
company
and
their
products.
This
is
a
very
good
Web
side.
Right
now
they
ship
out
from
US.
So
fast
you
can
get
it.
Doityourselflettering.com
is
total
awesome.
If
you
need
any
type
of
lettering,
this
is
the
place
to
go.
Great
store.
Price
and
selection
is
excellent.
They
ship
same
day
99%
of
the
time.
Prices
are
competitive
and
often
better
than
anyone
else
online.

I
enjoy

at

even
more
so
in

as
the

are
so

helpful-
just
like
a

The
clothes
are
always
on
trend
and
great

I'm
always
satisfied
with
my
purchases
as
I
am
buying
a
product
that
lasts.
YesStle

a
good
website.
It's
stylish,
user-friendly,
and
easy
to
navigate.
The
clothing

they're

look
very
good
and
promising.
I'm
not

sure
about
the

it's
my

I
haven't

I

Order
was
over
the
phone
because
of
having
to
clear
a
few
things
up
about
the
product
and
likely
timescale
for

but
once

everything
was

(some

next

Was
given
an

The
part
I
ordered
was
expensive,
however
my
part
git
to
my
door
so
fast
I
was
very
happy
with
partsgeek.
I
only
wish
they
had
more
of
what
I
need.
B

is
a
great
place
to
shop
and
learn.

Their
customer
service
is
excellent
and
they
always
have
everything
I'm
looking
for.

Keep
up
the
great
work!
Although
I
was
looking
for
umbrella/gazebo
LED
rope
lights,
I
am
very
satisfied
with
the
LED
lights
that
I
purchased.
The
site
is
designed
to
make
it
easy
to
make
a
rational
purchase
decision.

B&H
is
the
fastest
shipper--I
never
have
to
wait
for
my
deliveries
and
the
prices
are
very
competitive.
Outstanding
work

and
their
turn
around
time
is
fantastic.
Order
a
new
replacement
tail
light.

The
part
arrived
damaged
now
I
have
to
wait
for
my
money
to
be
refunded
and
I
have
to
pay
to
ship
the
part
back.

Not
a
great
experience,
and
if
I
want
a
new
part
I
must
reorder
it.
My
opinion
reflect
everything
I
had
to
say!
Excellent
service
Really
enjoyed
the
tours
and
the
48
hour
ticket
included
the
river
cruise.
The
buses
were
really
regular
-
ideal
for
hop
on/hop
off.
Staff
very
friendly.
The
only
slight
criticism
was
the
variability
in
the
quality
of
the
tour
guides
-
some
superb
(well
done
Martin!),
some
so-so.

Overall
though
was
well
worth
it.
They
deliver
right
to
your
door.
No

It

you
can
set

so
you
can
just

this
task
off
your
list.
The
food
just
arrives
at
your

at
whatever

you
set

No

I

a

for
my

I
paid
a

to

He
noted
during
the
install
that
the
fan
would
not
spin
freely
and
that
I
should
return
the
fan
for
a
new
one.

This
is
the
first
time
I
used
Priceline
for
car
rental.

Priceline
price
was
much
lower
than
the
Car
Rental's
official
site.

This
is
without
bidding.

We
will
use
Priceline
in
the
future.
I
ordered
my
item
on
7
December.

It
shows
shipped
on
12
December.

It
is
now
5
January
and
I
have
not
received
my
order.

I
have
had
several
pleasant
email
conversations
with
Danielle
from
customer
service,
but
with
no
resolution
presented
or
in
sight.

I
am
happy
to
deal
with
a
company
that
has
less
than
pleasant
customer
service
if
items
arrive
as
promised.

You
never
have
to
apologize
for
doing
a
job
correctly.
Great

Very
reliable,
awesome,
love
the

I
bought
rear
brake
hoses
that
were
shown
to
fit
my
vehicle
(81'
rabbit
pickup)
but
they
were
not
even
close
to
being
correct
and
did
not
fit.

I
was
shipped
the
wrong
parts,
ordered
s
shift
bushing
kit
and
got
a
pre-heater
hose.

Now
I
have
to
pay
shipping
to
return
and
item
that
I
did
not
even
order.

It
was
the
shipping
department
at
partsgeek
who
made
the
mistake.
Totally
unacceptable.
I've
shopped
with
drinkstuff.com
on
several
occasions
and
they
always
delver
the
goods
and
provide
good
customer
service.
On
one
occasion
I
had
chance
to
speak
to
them
directly
and
they
without
question
provided
some
addition
missing
parts.
Would
thoroughly
recommend
them
as
trustworthy
internet
goods
and
service
providers.
After
being
let
down
by
one
internet
supplier,
I
contacted
this
company
to
supply
the
same
goods.
They
arranged
express
delivery
and
were
very
professional
and
helpful.
I
would
certainly
recommend
that
you
purchase
from
this
company.
Good
quality
goods
(summer
house),
instructions
for
assembly
and
delivered
as
promised.
Ordered
a
garden
sofa
set
for
dellivery
last
Friday
(5
days
after
I
ordered).
Phoned
up
and
was
told
that
the
courier
had
lost
the
sofa
set
and
couldn't
locate
it.
They
promised
to
phone
on
Monday
to
confirm
delivery
-
they
didn't.
Ordered
a
number
of
large
valie
electrical
items
which
have
been
paid
for.
No
communication
from
Electricshop
as
to
state
of
delivery.
Have
had
to
phone
twice
to
be
told
goods
where
due
to
be
delivered
into
their
warehouse
the
following
day
-
only
to
then
phone
a
week
later
to
be
advised
they
were
due
to
be
delivered
the
same
week
-
still
not
recieved
goods
17
days
after
ordering
and
although
delivery
promised
for
Friday
-
I
am
not
hopeful.
The
research
was
easy
and
I
had
a
response
in
less
than
a
minute.

Great
pathway
to
secure
the
service
I
needed.

JUNK
!!!
DO
NOT
BUY
No
matter
what
the
supplement
is,
I
can
always
find
it
cheapest
at
Supplement
Warehouse.
And
better
yet,
the
free
samples
are
amazing!
I
haven't
bought
a
shaker
in
years,
because
I
just
replace
them
every
time
I
order.
An
even
bigger
bonus
are
the
free
samples
of
supplements.
I
have
found
some
amazing
supplements
that
I
have
switched
to,
thanks
to
these
samples.
Overall,
best
supplement
site
out
there.
The
product
ships
very
quickly.

The
quality
is
great.

No
surprises.
Nadya
is

the
BEST.
Ultimate
communicator.
Makes
a
complex
process
manageable.
First
order
with
firstaid4sport
and
very
happy
indeed
with
the
service
they
provided
well
done
Just
have
to
say
I
will
be
doing
more
business
with
this
company.
The
best
user
interface
I
have
found
and
I
have
tried
a
bunch,
and
great
prices!!
I'll
be
back!!
They
did
everything
they
said
on
the
tin.
No
regrets.
The
people
were
fantastic,
the
product
was
good
but
the
website
is
mediocre
at
best.

The
design
function
was
easy
to
use
but
I
created
a
label
before
I
set
up
an
account
and
when
I
set
up
my
account
it
erased
my
work,
then
after
I
recreated
my
label
and
put
the
it
in
the
cart
I
wasn't
able
to
view
it
again
before
I
purchased.

After
I
fulfilled
my
purchase
my
login
and
password
didn't
work
so
i
wasn't
able
to
see
the
shipping
timing
or
purchase
additional
labels.
I
always
go
to
Skypark
when
I
need
to
book
airport
parking.

They
give
you
details
of
all
the
available
options,
on-site
and
park-and-ride,
with
links
to
all
the
information
you
need
for
each
one,
including
price,
location,
travel
directions,
distance
from
the
airport
and
car
park
security.

They'll
recommend
one,and
tell
you
about
any
available
discounts,
but
you
can
go
for
whichever
car
park
you
like,
make
your
booking
and
complete
the
whole
transaction
from
the
Skypark
website.
Excellent
service.
I
ordered
a
couple
of
lightbulbs
that
wasn´t
available
in

Ordered
a

Phoned
me
to
say
they
needed
to
check
on
my
postcode
as
having
it
delivered
to
work,
that
was
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon.

We
received
an
email
to
say
that
it
would
be
delivered
the
next
day
at
a
certain
time
and
that's
exactly
what
happened.

This
is
not
the
first
time
we
have

think
the

they
provide
is
second
to
none.

After
living
in
Scotland
for
three
years,
1984
-
1987,
I
have
always
had
a
hearthfelt
connection.
My
purchase
at
Highland
Titles
has
set
that
connection
in
stone,
and
earth,
and
trees.

I
loved
the
ease
with
which
the
purchase
was
processed,
and
the
quickness
in
the
delivery
of
the
documents.

You've
thought
about
it;
now
do
it.
After
searching
Ebay,
Amazon
and
other
sites,
a
we
search
led
me
to
ScreenCountry.
There
may
have
been
cheaper
prices
listed
in
a
couple
of
places,
but
they
came
along
with
sketchy
feedback
ratings,
no
BBB
accreditation,
and
no
guarantees.
ScreenCountry's
website
walked
me
simply
thru
getting
the
right
screen,
it's
installation,
and
complete
satisfaction!
I
highly
recommend.

Amazing

great

Would

The

thing

is
that

create
an

be
able
to

the

own

my

they

I

very

When
my
folks
decided
to
get
a
puppy
for
the
first
time
in
years,
the
topic
of
pet
insurance
came
up.

Their
last
dog
turned
out
to
be
quite
expensive,
requiring
medication
for
most
of
her
life.

I
came
across
this
site
as
I
was
attempting
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
insurance
was
worth
it.

In
short,
I
was
impressed
with
the
organization,
and
I
found
Consumers
Advocate
to
be
extremely
helpful
in
the
decision
making
process.

I
definitely
recommend
this
resource.
great
place
to
shop
everything

Always
helpful!
Love

Thank
you!
I
have
no

problem
finding
what
I
need.It'seasy
to

order
and
a

good
product.I
am
pleased
with
the
service
I
received
an
e-mail
last
night
@
7:08
stating,
if.I
made
a
reservation
today,
I
should
call
your
customer
setvice
for
a
$5.00
discount.
I
was
told..I
was
not
eligible
for
the
discount,
because
it
was
aol's
problem
Working
with
Macs…A
Sales
Rep
from
my
company
came
to
me
with
a
problem.
She
had
a
.mov
file,
over
500mb,
and
she
needed
it
to
be
a
.wmv
and
smaller
than
300mb.
I
tried
re-encodeding
the
file
thru
a
well
known
Encoder….no
option
for
wmv….she
was
under
the
gun,
so
I
cut
the
file
in
half
and
outputted
mp4…..she
tried
uploading,
and
it
took
some
time…so
I
did
a
search
and
found
this
product…the
purchase
price
was
affordable,
so
I
purchased
and
was
now
able
to
output
the
file
as
a
wmv
on
my
Mac.
The
Sales
Rep
was
thrilled….Thanks,
Movavi.
Awesome
service
few
clicks
and
its
in
the
bag!!
Only
negative
is
the
delivery
next
day
is
not
next
day
but
its
outta
the
sites
hands..
Brought
for
30th
wedding
anniversary
was
delighted
with
the
service
received
and
how
quickly
they
were
delivered.
I
would
certainly
recomend
to
others
and
use
again
in
the
future.
Ordered
and
delivered
as
requested
,
Can't
say
much
more
than
my
one
liner
all
was
good
and
no
worry
or
issues
from
the
experience
,
thanks
I
found
the
somewhat
uncommon
products
that
I
was
looking
for
at
a
reasonable
price.
The
web
site
was
weasy
to
use
and
delivery
was
prompt.
Friend
-
what
a
great
website
to
find
and
purchase
photography
equipment
-
you
should
try
it.
As
soon
as
I
ordered
the
parts
it
was
confirmed
and
I
never
expected
to
receive
it
so
fast.
I
definitely
recommend
shopping
for
parts
I
am
based
in
Johannesburg
South
Africa
and
dealing
with
a
company
abroad
is
always
a
little
difficult,
but
Merlin
Cycles
were
fantastic
in
processing
my
order
and
dispatching
in
promptly.
Excellent
service
from
start
to
finish.
Ordering
online
was
a
pleasure.
I
got
a
call
back
to
confirm
my
order
&
delivery
details,
a
text
at
7.00am
to
confirm
my
4
hour
delivery
slot,
then
a
call
from
the
delivery
driver
to
say
he
would
be
here
within
the
hour,
and
then
a
call
to
say
that
he
was
5
minutes
away.
All
this
and
the
cheapest
price
on
the
web.
I
will
definitely
be
using
AO
again
:)
great
value
and
prompt
service
from
a
wide
range
of
products
I
contacted
sales
following
a
visit
to
the
website.

The
member
of
staff
who
dealt
with
my
enquiry
was
very
knowlegable
and
helpful.

The
product
arrived
in
good
time
and
are
of
excellent
quality.

I
would
definitely
recommend
the
site
and
also
I
will
use
them
again.
my
part
came
as
advertised,
no
frills,
no
muss
no
fuss,
just
really
fast.
This
Canon
5D
Mark
III
will
be
my
second
purchase
on
B&H.

The
first
was
our
51"
Samsung
Plasma
TV.

White
glove
delivery
was
outstanding
and
I
presume
the
quality
will
be
the
same
here.

Thanks
B&H
for
a
great
deal
with
tons
of
free
extras.

Will
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
looking
to
purchase
electronics.

Thank
you
B&H
team!
We
purchased
a
tour
from
London
to
Paris,
including
a
visit
to
the
Eiffel
tower.

We
were
not
informed
until
arrival
that
due
to
logistical
reasons,
the
tour
would
exclude
visiting
the
tower.

Marginally
satisfied
The
entire
process
was
stress
free
because
of
clear,
dependable
communications
throughout.
All
of
the
tracking
emails
were
timelyand
easy
to
understand.
Found
what
I
needed
on-line.

4Wheel
Drive
had
the
best
price.

Ordered
on-line
without
a
hitch.

Received
it
so
fast
it
was
delivered
to
the
mailing
address
days
before
I
even
thought
about
checking
for
it.
They
provided
translation
of
3
pages
within
a
few
hours.
Don't
buy
goods
from
them.
They
take
forever
to
ship.

This
is
not
the
first
time
this
has
happened.

When
you
contact
them,
they
give
you
the
same
generic
response.

This
last
order
is
going
to
take
almost
4
weeks
to
get
to
me.

It's
not

enough
they
claim
2
and
half
weeks.(Which
I
think
is
not
right)

We're
a
small
company
of
40
and
can
manage
shipping
1300
orders
a
day.
Since
dealing
with
Global
Reach,
which
has
not
been
that
long,
I
can
categorically
say
that
they
have
been
extremely
helpful
and
efficient
in
all
the
dealings
I
have
had
with
them.

They
were
recommended
to
me
by
a
friend
and
I
would
most
certainly
recommend
them
too.

The
account
was
very
easy
to
set
up
and
each
transaction
takes
a
couple
of
days
which
is
perfect.
Found
the
part
I
needed
and
it
was
in
my
mail
box
before
I
knew
it.
Thanks
for
the
great
customer
service.
will
visit
again
when
I
need
something
which
I
hope
is
soon
as
I
expect
to
buy
used

in
the
next
few
days
and
now
will
know
where
to

Too

Ordered

works
great
&
price
was
good;
but
your
shipping
method
&
timeliness
definitely
could
use
improvement.
Easy

arrange
tranfer

Good

Tranfers

My

has
been
very
good
so
far.
Nice,
quite
and
safety
place
for
storage
with
very
friendly
workers
there.
I
wouldn't
bother
about
my

I
trust
this

Took
a
while
to

about

Excellent

We
love
PetFlow.
We
buy
our
specialty
dog
food
from
PetFlow
-
the
prices
are
great,
and
the
delivery
is
wonderful.
The
food
always
comes
when
promised,
usually
the
next
day
or
two.
It
is
so
convenient
-
so
glad
we
found
PetFlow.
I
do

and
most
of

time
MCM
beats
the
so
called
wholesale
price!
Now
if
that's
not
a
good
deal,
let
me
know
who
has
a
better
deal!
Every
dollar
I
save
is
really
a
dollar
earned.
Great
Site
for
older
trucks
and
cars
It
is
cheaper
than
Nespresso
but
only
1
coffee
can
compare
in
terms
of
flavour-Dark
Strong.
I
was
a
little
unsure
at
first
about
the
arrangements
for
handing
over
my
car
but
it
all
went
perfectly.
This
is
much
faster
and
smoother
than
the
normal
off
airport
parking
and
at
these
comparable
prices
will
become
the
'way
to
go',
especially
if
you're
short
on
time
to
catch
your
plane.
I
discovered
Heath
Designs
in
a
search
at
google.

I
can
say
i'm
very
satisfied
with
products
and
price
they
offer
on
the
site.

Delivery
is
also
always
on
time.
Easy
and
fast
service.
No
problems
at
all.
Highly
recommended.
Just
recieved
a
cushion
and
I
am
very
pleased.

I
did
a
web
search
before
ordering
and
the
prices
were
extremely
competative.

Parcel
arrived
the
following
day.

I
will
have
to
look
and
see
what
else
they
have.
The
items
that
I
ordered
are
the
same
as
my
Doctor
uses
so
I
know
that
they
can
be
trusted.

Ordering
was
painless
and
items
recieved
by
return
of

Great

A

recent
purchase
has
surprise
me
,
Rough
Rider
Coal
Miner
made
in
China,
the
quality
of
workmanship
is
very
good
and
comes

razor
sharp
out
of
the
box
at
a
reasonable
price,
only
time
will
tell

if
the
build
quality
holds
up.
Quality
is
questionable
at
times,
perhaps
at
times,
it
has
to
do
with
the
cell
phone
system
in
the
Philippines.
Many
dropped
calls.
Lost
minutes
recently
when
the
ring
changed
on
the
other
end

The

They
were
more
than
willing

help
and

in
the
right
direction.
I
will
definitely
be
buying
more!
Just

I

Thanks
I

be
happy

the
info
they

I
have
dealt
with
SBTG
for
many
years
now
and
always
found
their
products
to
be
top-notch.
Like
they
say
"If
we
don't
use
it
we
don't
sell
it".
Unlike
nearly
every
other
company
out
there
if
they
say
it
is
stock,
it
is!
If
they
say
you
have
to
wait
a
few
days
that's
all.
Other
companies
I
have
had
to
deal
with
because
SBTG
didn't
have
the
exact
part
just
charged
my
card
upfront
and
told
me
my
order
has
been
placed
but
delivery
time
is
4-6
weeks
from
Italy.
This
sort
of
thing
makes
me
crazy
especially
when
you
are
in
the
middle
of
a
project.
I
am
currently
travelling
in
USA.
We
booked
most
of
our
trip/accommodation
prior
to
travelling.
we
had
2
nights
to
sort
out
but
weren't
exactly
sure
of
our
intinerary.
having
decided
to
go
to
santa
fe
via
Durango
Colorado
from
Utah,
we
then
tried
to
book
Strater
hotel
in
Durango
-
we
have
stayed
there
before
and
its
a
great
experience.
I
went
online
last
night
and
tried
to
book.
There
were
2
websites
that
I
had
used
before
that
offered
the
hotel
but
both
were
unable
to
process
my
request
-
"experiencing
technical
problems".
I
then
went
through
Easytobook.com
and
the
confirmation
was
instantaneous.
I
could
not
believe
it
having
tried
these
other
sites
for
at
least
10

minutes.
Result?
wife
now
very
happy
she
is
staying
in
a
favourite
hotel
and
the
credit
goes
to
easytobook.com
You
just
can't
beat
their
selection,
prices,
and
service.
They
truly
have
me
spoiled
when
it
comes
to
online
shopping.
I
really
wish
they
would
have
more
complete
descriptions
and
more
photos
of
the

parts
being
sold.
Things
like
"this
part
ONLY
fits
these
car
models.
I
was
also
dissatisfied
that
they

Oh
well

Oh
one
more
thing...why
on
earth
is
there
a
15%

Bullshit...just

West
Coast
Shaving
is
quick,
easy
to
use
and
has
one
of
the
best
selections
I've
seen.
Whether
you're
an
experienced
wet
shaver
or
new
to
the
method,
WCS
should
be
the
first
site
to
shop!
Our
order
was
delivered
as
promised.
We
were
told
the
flowers
were
very
nice
and
the
price
was
competitive.
Within
seconds
of
submitting
my
application,
I
was
quickly
directed
to
an
approved
lender
for
my
loan
request.

Quick
and
easy!
Always
keen
pricing
and
fast,
secure
deliveries
good
price
easy

v
good
but,
you
failed
to
tell
the
garage
i
was
coming,
they
got
you
out
of
"it"
though.
Computer
delivered
as
per
spec.,
very
well
packed
and
on

Only
qualification
is
regarding
the
dreaded
Windows
8
-
but
that
is
not
the
fault
of
Dino
PC.
Blackcircles
offered
me
the
best
price
for
my
Pirelli
6000's,
the
tyres
were
available
immediately
and
fitted
nearby
nexy
day.
A
first
class
service.
Good
quality
product
and
great
communication
throughout
the
process.
I've
been
a
Squaretrade
customer
for
years,
and
have
gone
through
a
dozen
or
so
policies
between
my
present
and
past
smartphones
and
tablets.

I'm
careful
with
my
gadgets,
using
cases
and
generally
being
cautious
when
using
them.

Two
weeks
ago
my
paranoia
caught
up
with
me
and
my
HTC
One
stopped
charging.

I
filed
the
claim
online
Wednesday
night,
got
authorization
and
a
shipping
label
the
next
day,
and
mailed
it
in
on
Friday.

It
arrived
onsite
the
following
Tuesday
and
I
had
a
working
phone
at
my
doorstep
on
Friday.

Looking
at
the
phone
you
couldn't
tell
any
repairs
have
been
done,
and
as
far
as
I
understand
it
the
HTC
One
is
a
very
hard
phone
to
service
without
marring
the
metal
finish.
Specsavers
couldnt
provide
me
with
what
i
required
without
another
eye-test
but
Lenstore
made
it
easy
and
hassle
free
to
get
the
contact
lenses
I
needed.
The
website
was
easy
to
navigate
and
the
lenses
were
with
me
in
a
short
space
of
time.
Great
price,
new
starter,
not
a
rebuilt.

Free
shipping
is

a
very
good
policy!!!


FedX

Smartpost
was
kinda
slow
,
took
almost
9
days
to
go
275
miles.
Inexpensive,
great
quality,
rapid
turnaround.
It
was
fairly
easy
to
navigate
the
site
and
after
a
couple
of
tries,
I
got
to
where
I
wanted
to
be.

The
major
obstacle
was
trying
to
modify
the
finished
booking.

When
I
tried
to
do
a
modification,
it
told
me
to
call
their
800
number.

When
I
did
the
recording
said
that
I
would
be
charged
a
convenience
fee,
however,
after
talking
to
an
agent.
I
was
told
it
could
be
waived.

Other
wise
everything
went
well.

I
especially
liked
the
part
where
I
could
charge
this
to
my
BillMeLater
account.
Great
vendor
-
love
the
product
AND
the
service.
First

and
helpfull.

Selected

quick
and
pleasent.
The
prices
were
good
but
the
service
was
just
ok.
Not
very
professional
and
took
quit
a
long
time.
Longer
then
I
thought.
Also
the
warehouse
were
customers
wait
was
quit
cold.
First
time
I
came
in
they
were
all
eating
fast

at

was
fast

and
is
still
fast

great

Will
probably
use
again.
I
bought
a
jacket
from
the
website,
it
was
well
priced,
looked
good
and
was
delivered
free.

Usually
when
something
is
delivered
for
free
it's
sent
on
a
slow
moving
camel
but
this
was
received
a
day
later
in
the

very
impressed!!
Great

I
shopped
all

The
Supplement

ordering
system
and

are
quick
and
efficient.
Working
on
a

requires
long

and
demanding

This
often
leaves
us
little
time
to
shop
for
supplements,
or
reasonable

The

gives
me
and
my
fellow

the

source
for
all

at

I
now

again
the

I
am
not
sure
why
this

light

working
OK.
I
have
yet
to
receive
an

suggesting
what
I
should
do
with
it.
Maybe
they
will
replace
it.
I
like
these
glasses.
They
are
my
second
pair
and
my
next
pair
will
be
exactly
the
same.
They
are
timeless

I
really
like
what
giftcards.com
has
to
offer
but
my
only
complaint
is
that
your
shipping
charges
are
out
of
line.
I
think
$1.99
ea.
for
maybe
one,
two
or
even
three
cards
is
okay
but
beyond
that
you
need
to
go
with
the
USPS
'Flat
Rate'.
If
by
chance
I
order
20
cards
it
would
cost
me
$40.
to
ship,
that's
nonsense.
You
could
fit
50
cards
in
a
flat
rate
envelope
for
around
$5.65
total
shipping.
Saying
this
is
for
handling
is
just
a
cover
up
for
charging
higher
card
fees,
I
don't
like
it.
You
don't
need
to
charge
extra
for
handling!!
You
already
charge
up
to
a
$4.95
fee
per
card
and
that
should
cover
your
handling
costs.
I
would
seriously
address
this
concern.

While
I
have
to
say
I
always

Ancestry.com

I
bought
a
Nikon
camera
from
them
and
they
explained
the
whole
shipping
process
to
me
over
the
phone
and
were
very
helpful.
I
received
my
camera
in
only
a
few
days
which
was
awesome
because
it
had
come
all
the
way
from
Hong
Kong.
I
definitely
recommend
these
guys!
Dear
B&H
team,
The
controller
was
very
easy
to
order
and
it
was
delivered
several
days
before
it
was
promised.

I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.

They
are
top
notch
and
effidient.
I
first
found
out
about
this
product
from
a
online
review
site
which
compared
them
to
the
other
options
in
the
space
called
consumers
advocate.
What
tipped
the
scale
for
me
was
that
along
with
their
price
being
low,
they
also
had
been
recommended
by
AARP
which
I
think
has
a
strong
reputation.
Ultimately
this
service
is
well
worth
it
for
my
grandmother
who
lives
alone
and
has
already
had
a
fall.
I
appreciate
that
she
now
has
their
monitoring
service
to
stay
safer.
There
are
very
few
sources
of
information
online
for
medical
alerts.
When
my
grandmother
had
her
fall,
she
cut
her
leg
extremely
deeply
and
nobody
knew
about
it
for
several
hours
before
my
aunt
happened
to
stop
by.
For
seniors
who
live
alone
getting
a
service
like
the
medical
alert
from
medical
guardian
can
be
the
difference
in
how
long
they
get
much
needed
care.
Consumers
advocates
helped
me
to
find
the
AARP
recommended
medical
alert
which
is
also
less
expensive
with
better
hardware
as
compared
with
the
other
options
out
there.
I
needed
to
find
a
plumber
when
my
house
had
the
sewer
line
collapse
creating
an
emergency
situation.
Angie's
list
helped
introduce
me
to
a
local
plumber
who
came
out
on
a
days
notice
to
provide
a
second
opinion
that
literally
saved
me
thousands
of
dollars.
Easily
worth
the
cost
when
you
think
about
it.
Paid

What
I
really
love
about
kayak
is
their
sorting
functionality.
Often
when

I

a
certain
time.
Kayak
makes
it
easy
for
me
to
do
this
by
sliding
to

That's
why
they
are
my
top
choice
for
online
bookings!

for
future
purchases.
Tried
to
return
a
defective
part
and
they
dont
answer
to
calls.
Now
im
stuck
with
this
defective
part
and
cant
return
it.
There
were
two
translation
mistakes.
The
title
was
wrongly
translated
as
Certificate
of
Marriage
when
it
should
be
Certificate
of
Birth
and
the
time
I
was
born
was
translated
as
6:25
and
not
4:25
(16:25).
REV
did
correct
the
problem
promptly,
though,
but
I
wonder
what
could
have
happened
if
I
didn't
speak
English!
they
always
have
the
best
price
and
deliver
faster
then
other
companies.
The
lights
work
great
for
my
dog.
He
has
problems
seeing
at
night
being
he
is
14
years
old.
Also
using
them
for
key
chain
lights.
Got
my
shipment
in
and
only
two
of
them
did
not
work
out
of
twenty.
Not
bad.
Love
the
lights
and
price
was
right.
Goog
and
very
fast!
Best

I

for
many
years.

As
a

of
a

20

I
expect

always
met
my
needs.
I
was
in

out
of
the

to
get
a

within
45
minutes,
instead
of

I

years
ago

Couldn't

The

good.
Some

not

Don't
like
how
the
delivery

is
set
to
the

On

I
like
that
I
can
add
extra

to
make
the

reach
the
minimum
and
therefore
not
order
extra
items
just
to
reach
it
on

I
do
like
the

even

the

up

I'd
had

brilliant!
It
couldn't

there
wasn't
20

just

and
boom,
we

I
like
the

I'm
giving

even
though
they
had
a
good
delivery
and
a
good

because
I
didn't

that's
a

I

I
went
to
partsgeek.com
and
looked
up
2008
Subaru
Outback
Sport
-
and
found
the
drivers
side
fog
light
assembly.

But,
I
couldn't
find
the
passenger
side.

So,
I
opened
a
support
ticket
titled
"2008
Subaru
Outback
Sport"
from
their
customer
service
link
asking
if
they
had
the
passenger
side
fog
lamp
assembly.

Within
48
hours
they
sent
me
an
email
telling
me
they
found
the
passenger
side
fog
light
assembly
and
for
my
convenience
included
a
link
to
a
shopping
cart
which
already
contained
the
part.

Cool
I
thought,
I'll
just
add
the
drivers
side
fog
light
to
the
cart
and
check
out.
Part
wasnt
the

slightly

and

I

since
I
never

I
do

Order
a

It

reasonably

Great

I
will
definitely
order
from

again.
The

provided
sufficient

Company.
Found
exactly
what
I
was
lookibg
for
on
their
website.

Placed
my
order
and
had
the
part
in
just
a
few
days.
Really
was
stress
free,
great
to
not
have
to
worry
about
shuttle
buses!
I
found
the
service
was
simple
to
use
and
very
transparent.

I
contacted
the
provider
on
two
or
three
occasions
and
always
got
a
prompt
phone
call
response
AND
a
follow
up
email.

Top
rate
in
my
opinion.
I
ordered
a
'Double
Pack'
item.

Only
one
was
delivered.

One
email
later
I
received
the
missing
items
a
day
later
with
some
additional
goodies
included.

Very
good
customer
service!!
but
was
disappointed
with
some
(key
items)
being
out
of
stock.
I
bought
a
PS3
bundle
over
the
holidays,
it
was
the
cheapest
price
I
could
find.
But
it
was
the
delivery
service
that
was
exemplary.
They
not
only
give
you
the
day
of
the
delivery
but
also
the
hour
it
will
be
arriving
in
and
it
was
absolutely
spot
on.
I'm
one
very
happy
customer
and
will
definitely
return
to
them.

for
a
service
that
can
find
the
best
possible
rental
space
for
you
based
on

then
you
want

it

I
went
to
pick
up
my
car
at
the
office
on
William

in
Central
business
District
of
Sydney.
The
clerk
was
rude
and
they
did
not

for
two
hours
past
the
time
I
was
supposed
to
arrive.
Hello!
I'm

I

I
will
be

again.


Fair

Disappointing
that
within
the
last
order
of
6
bags
of
dog
food,
2

were
split
&
contents
spilled
in
the

Excellent
value
for
money
&
prompt
delivery.
Would
strongly
recommend.
Overall
I
got
exactly
what
I
wanted
from
CoilCraft.
My
one
complaint
is
that
ordering
parts
(instead
of
requesting
samples)
requires
you
to
have
the
part
name
memorized
and
is
a
bit
unintuitive.
best
price,
fast
delivery,
just
excellent
Great
and
quick
service
with
free
samples
that
do
not
boost
shipping
all
that
much.
Ultimately
a
great
buy
and
coming
back
to
make
more
purchases
in
the
future.
Love
how
you

The

I
received
were
totally
illegible..........................totally
unacceptable
Every
time
I
have
ordered
parts
on
this
site
I
have
gotten
the
correct
parts
in
excellent

in
the
time
specified.

AND
I
SAVE
MONEY!

Enough
said!

Use
it!
I
needed
the
tester
for
testing
a
heated
tile
floor
system.
I
ordered
the
tester
and
it
showed
up
in
two
days,
which
was
awesome.
The
tester
was
easy
to
use
and
the
tile
floor
is
well
on
its
way
to
completion.
I've
been
recommending
this
to
all
my
mates.
This
is
the
cheapest
protein
on
the
market
that
I
can
find,
but
is
still
great
quality.
With
24
grams
of
protein
per
30
gram
scoop,
that's
better
than
USN.
All
the
flavors
I've
tried
are
really
nice
too.
Prompt
delivery
and
great
value!!!
I
had
been
badly
let
down
by
another
supplier,
so
I
ordered
with
these
guys
and
got
my
stuff
the
very
next
day.
Felt
like
Christmas!!
Well
done.
I
ordered
a
DJ
Flight
case
for
my
Kontrol
S4+F1
setup.

I
couldn't
find
one
anywhere
here
in
the
USA,
so
of
the
places
I
saw
internationally
BopDJ
had
the
best
price
and
reasonable
shipping.

The
transaction
was
easy
and
smooth
(which
was
great
because
I
wasn't
too
keen
on
international
purchasing).

They
shipped
the
product
out
quickly
and
even
provided
US
customs
with
some
information
about
the
product
that
I
didn't
think
they
would
be
able
to
find
to
let
the
US
release
the
item
to
me.

And
it
STILL
got
to
me
quicker
than
what
I
thought
it
would.

I'm
VERY
happy
with
my
experience
dealing
with
BopDJ
and
would
gladly
do
it
again!
I
found
this
company
to
be
first
class
from
start
to
finish
with
my
order.
I
ordered
beetle
juice
extra
large
out
fit.
I
tried
it
on
but
jacket
was
too
tight.
I
didn't
have
time
to
return
it
and
couldn't
find
larger
size
on
Internet
so
we
tried
to
adjust
,
but
still
no
luck
then
discovered
it
was
actually
standard
size
and
the
packaging
clearly
stated
XL
so
really
unhappy
as
useless
outfit
and
surplus
wig
and
had
to
get
something
else
instead.
I
am
unable
to
use
my
reward
points...not
fair
and
not
informative
I
was
very
impressed,
as
I
was
given
a
tracking
number
and
kept
updated.
My
goods
arrived
in
time
and
in
excellent
condition
and
exactly
as
I
had
ordered.
I
would
definitely
recommend
them
to

and
friends

I
bought
a
Coolster
125cc
ATV
for
my
daughter.
Killer
Motorsports
dd
a
good
job
on
sending
the
av
out
quickly
and
notifing
me
when
needed.
Shipping
was
really
quick
received
in
less
than
a
week.
Putting
the
atv
together
was
extremely
easy
and
the
ATV
runs
great.
My
daughter
loves
the
ATV.
Id
recommend
KMS
to
everyone.
I
Had
to
wait
a
week
because
Solid
Gold
Weebit
was
out
of
stock
in
33#.
I
was
notified
immediately
by
email
and
given
option
of
cancelling
order
or
waiting.
I
decided
to
give
them
a
chance
and
the
wait
was
short.
If
it
auto
ships
on
time
I
will
give
it
5
stars
next
time!
The
website
is
well
laid-out
and
constantly
updated.
Once
an
order
is
placed
you
are
apprised
of
it`s
status
and
they
even
tell
you
when
it
has
been
dispatched.
Delivery
is
quick
and
sure.
An
object
lesson
in
how
to
run
an
internet
business.
Having
ordered
several
items
[double
oven,
induction
hob,
fridge
freezer
and
chimney
extractor]
the
order
and
delivery
process
was
painless.
Delivery
was
five
days
early


The
driver
was
extremely
nice
notwithstanding
a
rotten
access
and
helpful
from
start
to
finish



A
pleasure
to
have
been
so
served
I
ordered
a
radiator
fan
assembly
from
you
and
unfortunately
when
I
opened
the
package
it
had
been
damaged
and
cracked
during
shipping.

I
immediately
sent
an
email
to
customer
service
and
a
return
email
was
promptly
sent
the
next
day.

Personally
I
know
it
would
probably
raise
the
cost
but
I
would
like
to
speak
to
someone
in
person
when
there
is
a
problem.

Having
to
send
an
email
makes
it
seem
as
though
you
don't
really
care.

When
I
now
know
that
is
not
the
case.

Luckily,
I
was
able
to
swap
the
fans
out
of
the
new
housing
and

into
the
old
housing
and
"problem
averted".
Fast

the
good
work.
A
great
company
to
work
with.
Very
customer
focused.
Excellent
communicatio
and
service.
I
will
use
them
again.
I
was
excited
to
be
introduced
to
your
company,
website
and
product.
It
was
a
great
price,
I
immediately
order
it
after
checking
all
websites
for
the
best
deal.
Overall
you
had
the
best
price.
So
I
went
with
a
new
company
taking
a
chance
to
save
$4.00
over
a
company
I
have
used
several
time.
Several
days
later,
(not
sure
of
time
span),
I
was
contacted
that
the
product
was
unavailable
and
I
would
be
refunded
the
purchased
price.
That
seem
all
fair
and
great
except
the
other
companies
that
were
very
close
to
your
price
sold
out
after
I
thought
we
finalized
a
sale.
So
to
make
it
short,
your
company
needs
to
consider
not
selling
items
they
don"t
have
inventory
on.
This
seem
like
basic
customer
service
for
a
real
webased
store.
Thanks
for
giving
me
an
opportunity
to
vent!

However,
after
the
my
initial
experience
Mike
Walsh
followed
up
and
made
sure
the
account
and
transaction
was
correctly
cancelled
.
He
did
a
great
job
and
responded
to
my
emails.
He
was
a
shining
star
in
the
whole
experience
I
ordered
an
Xbox
360
game
for
a
very
low
price
and
late
at
night
on
the
Tuesday.

I
received
it
on
Thursday
morning
and
have
to
say
that
I'm
impressed
with
the
quick
service
from
shopto.net
and
would
recommend
that
others
shop
there.
very
good
customer
service
and
fast
delivery
As
the
econ
is
tough
right
now,
and
I
was
searching
for
deals,
Mr
Chewy
proved
to
have
the
best
deal
when
you
set
up
a
delivery
plan.
I
wasnt
sure
I
would
go
with
a
plan
but
after
thinking
about
it,
it
made
sense,
and
the
savings
was
right.
Delivery
was
quick,
and
the
site
will
let
me
manage
future
deliveries.
Customer
service
was
nice
but
not
that
knowledgeable
when
I
had
some
specific
questions,
however
they
returned
my
call
and
questions
the
best
they
could.
These
guys
rock!
Thanks
for
such
a
great
and
reasonable
product?m
I
was
searching
for
a
storage
unit
nearby
since
I'll
be
moving
away
for
a
few
months.
Selfstorage.com
laid
out
the
options
for
me
and
made
it
incredibly
easy
to
find
an
affordable
unit
at
a
facility
close
by.
I
was
able
to
reserve
in
seconds
for
my
desired
date
and
got
a
phone
call
the
next
day
about
the
reservation.
I've
already
recommended
it
to
my
friends.
This
is
the
easiest
way
to
save
money
possible.
Simply
add
the
savings
from
the
gift
cards
with
coupons
or
store
specials
to
save
even
more.
Greg
was
a
great
help.
Greg
like
talk
to
a
friend
that
you
had
years.

Talking
like
one
of
the
guys
I
went
to
school
with.
Have
a
good
day
It
was
a
no
doubt
a
great
experience
working
with
a
team
of
skilled,
experienced
and
efficient
web
developers.
Apart
from
working
fast
on
my
project,
they
responded
to
all
my
queries
quickly
which
is
something
I
value
a
lot.
On
top
of
designing
a
great
website,
these
guys
also
helped
with
my
website’s
SEO
helping
it
to
gain
better
rankings.
Thank
you
a
lot.
I
always
find
what
I
am
looking
for
at
B
&
H
and
usually
at
the
best
price
available.
I
have
given
up
looking
elsewhere.

I
could
not
locate
this
part
on
a
shelf
at
a
local
retailer,
so
I
turned
to
the
internet;
finding
many
e-retailers
and
varying
prices.

After
a
few
price
queries-
I
found
the
best
deal
at
PartsGeek.

Many
Thanks
The
new
clear

arrived
very
fast,
and
in
perfect

I
liked
to
free
shipping!
I
have
tried
other
companies
in
the
past,
and
must
say
yours
is
by
far
the
easiest
to
deal
with,
and
prompt.
I
have
no
issues
whatsoever.
I
wish
all
my
company
contacts
were
as
professional.
I've
never
experienced
any
problems
with
CJS
CD
Keys.
They've
always
dispatched
my
keys
very
quickly
once
payment
has
been
received
and
on
the
one
occasion
I
did
have
to
contact
support
as
my
payment
was
showing
as
not
received
they
were
very
polite
and
had
the
issue
resolved
in
10
minutes!
if
I'm
shopping
around
online
'bike
24'
is
usually
the
last
stop,
nobody
else
compares
unless
they
are
on
special,
even
then
bike
24
can
be
cheaper,
most
people
don't
believe
me
and
carry
on
buying
from
CRC
and
wiggle,
more
fool
them.
It
was
fast
,convenient,
and
I
got
a
great
deal
.

Great

Very

The

the

I

30%

I'm

Found
what
I
was
looking

and
this
site
helped
me
buy
the
items
I
needed
to
use
and
protect
my

good
products,good
value,and
speedy
delivery
I
ordered
a
parts
kit.

They
sent
1
piece
to
a
5
piece
kit.

It
took
4
days
to
get
someone
to
contact
me
back
using
their
Customer
Service
Ticket
System.

It
is
a
joke,
you
will
never
speak
to
a
live
person.

They
told
me
to
reorder
and
only
credited
me
for
the
part
price.
I
got
stiffed
on
shipping
even
though
it
was
completely
their
fault.

You'll
find
that
little

in

I've
learned
my
lesson.
Very
good
prices,
latest
technology,
and
easy
to
navigate
and
shop
on
the
website
Ordered
my
tyres
on-line
at
a
very
good
price,
turned
up
at
the
retailer
as
agreed
and
had
two
tyres
fitted
within
20
mins.
Can't
ask
for
better
than
that!
Retailer
was
MadHouse
on
Old
Kent
Road,
London.
The
web
site
was
really
easy
to
use
and
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
delivery
which
I
chose
I
looked
to
see
what
time
it
would
be
delivered.
You
are
given
a
2
hour
time
slot.
They
then
rang
about
10
minutes
before
the
delivery
to
say
they
were
on
the
way.
They
were
polite
and
very
efficient.
Would
defiantly
use
them
again
Я
очень
довольна.
Работают
на
отлично.
We
transferred
money
directly
from
our
bank
at
the
same
time
as
using
Transferwise
so
that
we
could
make
a
comparison.

Transferwise
is
cheaper,
but
we
made
less
than
half
the
amount
of
saving
that
was
estimated.
Excellent
company
very
quick
for
delivery
well
packed
when
it
arrives
and
a
easy
website
to
use
and
look
through.
I
always
buy
something
from
here
for
costume
party's
and
it's
always
been
a
good
experience.
Will
be
ordering
again
very
soon
when
we
have
another
party.
I
brought
a
onesie
of
the
site
and
thought
was
going
to
be
hard
trying
to
sort
size
and
so
on
but
when
I
went
on
the
item
everything
was
where
it
should
be,
easy
to
use
and
clear.
Would
definitely
use
this
site
again
So
this
was
the
first
time
that
I
ordered
a
key
at
cjs
keys.
I
already
knew
about
the
company
because
their
bf3
english
translation
files
site
is
pretty
popular
but
I
never
bought
it
here
because,
well,
I
didn't
have
a
phone
at
my
disposal
haha.
Now
I
have
and
everything
went
fast.
Got
the
code

within
5
min.
(and
that's
only
because
I
had
to
configure
my
mobile
number,
It
could
have
been
quicker)
so
If
you
wanna
have
your
game
serial

code
fast...
cjs

is
that
way
to
go
:D
I
called
to
get
a
vacation
package
in
our
budget.
After
speaking
with
the
representative
for
almost
an
hour.
She
offered
us
a

a
little
more
than
our

for
a

My
sister
turned
me
on
to
the
geeks
and
I
bought
an
ac
compressor
for
84.00.
The
best
price
I
had
found
online
was
313.00.
I
saved
441.00
over
the
mechanics
quote.
Before
you
buy
an
auto
part
online,
always
check
the
geeks
out
first!
I
only
received
them
last
weekand
opened
over
the
weekend.

Used
one
for
my
own
computer
on
Satruday
and
everything
seemed
to
work
fine.

Thought
the
pricing
wsa
a
little
too
high
versus
some
of
the
foreign
competition
that
pushes
these.

But
decided
to
go
with
Flashbay
based
on
the
name
brand
chip
they
said
supplied
the
techie
part
of
it.

Time
wll
tell
as
we
give
them
out
to
our
customers
over
the
next
few
months.
I
am
a
Hugh

this

Thanks
for

Had
my

changed
at
25%
of
the
cost
of

I
cant
really

either
as
compared
to
what
I
had
from
the

time
around.

I'll
be

Great

I'll

This
is
my
second
purchase
from
West
Coast
Shaving
and
I
really
like
the
service
that
I
get
from
them.
They
have
a
selection
of
product's
that
is
hard
to
find
in
one
place
anywhere
else.
The
prices
are
very
reasonable
and
the
shipping
is
right
on
the
nose
too.
Someone
in
another
post
complained
about
the
shipping
being
to
high
but
if
you
look
at
other
sites
that
sell
thing's
,
they
are
a
lot
higher
in
shipping
or
they
push
the
price
up
and
say
it's
free
shipping
,
Not
So.

Overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
web
sites
I
have
shopped
at.
The
product's
that
West
Coast
Shaving
carries
are
very
high
grade
and
that
speak's
for
itself.
Thank's

for
being

As
a
nature/wildlife
photographer,
and
after
years
of
buying
equipment
from
various
companies,
I
learned
that
I
wanted
a
vendor
that
I
could
trust
...trust
them
to
provide
all
information
I
needed
about
a
product,
provide
competitive
prices,
trust
them
to
stand
behind
their
promises
and
warranties,
and
if
I
am
not
satisfied
with
the
product,
to
make
it
right.
Superb
value
for
money
with
no
sacrifice
in

quality.
Website
great
with
ordering
very
easy.
Five
star
service
at
a
budget
price!
excellent
site
and
shipping
was
spot

Like
I
said,
damn
near
perfect..

And
with
grateful
thanks
to
Seat61.com
for
pointing
me
in
the
right
direction.

The
only
painful
part
of
the
transaction
will
come
when
I
have
to
pay
my
credit
card.
I
have
bought
a
few
items
from
here
and
the
service
has
been
great.
Had
a
problem
once
with
keys
due
to
they
were
out
of
stock
but
they
made
sure
to
restock
them
as
quick
as
possible.
The
website
was
easy
to
use
and
ordering
was
a
snap.
Great
ordering
experience
I
would
thoroughly
recommend
this
company
for
price
and
good
service.

FIRST

I
studied
your
installation
videos
and
gave
it
a
try.

In
the
video
the
backing
on
the
backs
of
the
lettering
was
not
paper
which
is
easily
torn.

It
was
some
kind
of
stiff
poly
propylene
backing
which
could
not
be
torn
and
needed
a
pair
of
scissors
to
cut.

This
manipulation
was
difficult
for
two
hands
and
I
was
lucky
that
I
was
able
to
smooth
out
a
small
tear
in
one
letter.
This
place
has
everything
you
need
and
more
importantly
every

everything
you
need.

I
found
Dolphin
Fitness
after
my
usual
company
didn't
stock
what
I
was
after.
DF
was
easy
to
use,
not
badly
priced
-
liked
the
follow
up
e-mails
to
let
me
know
when
product
was
picked
up
etc
(unlike
some
companies
their
link
to
track
my
order
actually
worked).
My
ONLY
gripe
is
that
I
specifically
asked
that
they
phone
on
approach.
Maybe
I
should
have
written
my
number
on
the
additional
info
BUT
as
I'd
already
given
it
I
presumed
it'd
be
passed
on
to
the
delivery
guys.
This
meant
that
although
my
product
was
delievered
before
12:00
I
couldn't
get
it
till
the
next
day.
Bit
annoyed
but
overall
happy
with
the
experience
and
will
use

Ive
used
this
company
a

times

never

Almost

Great
range,
great

I'd
reccommend
them
to
anybody.
A
down
to
earth,
efficient,
friendly
organisation
with

I
have

I

The

were
everything
I

Seem
to

was
fast
and
packed

I
will

Booking
with
Bookit.
Parts
Geek
has
great
prices.
That
is
the
ONLY
positive
thing
I
can
say
about
them.
Having
purchased
from
Parts
Geek
in
the
past,
I
was
pleased
to
see
a
decent
price
on
a
Coolant
Temp.
sensor
for
my
2005
Mazda.
But
then
I
noticed
something
odd.
The
price
displayed
when
up
a
little
bit
when
I
put
it
in
the
cart.
Wanting
to
see
what
was
going
on,
I
opened
another
page,
and
tried
it
again,
-
same
thing
-
it
added
a
few
dollars
to
the
price.
I
am
not
saying
this
was
intentinal
or
malicious,
but
I
am
not
saying
it
ISN'T
either.
Just
watch
for
this.
Then
when
I
hit
"Place
Order"
the
system
went
and
put
BOTH
shopping
cart
items
in
and
the
total
was
doubled.
Ugh.
I
started
right
then
trying
to
correct
it
bus
guess
what?
All
the
800
phone
numbers,
for
sales,
customer
service
etc.
are
all
just
recordings
telling
you
to
submit
a
ticket
from
the
web
site.
They
even
lie
and
say
"Call
volume
is
heavy"
Not
bloody
likely
since
each
menu
choice
is
a
dead
end,
telling
you
to
use
the
web
site
and
disconnecting
the
call.
Nest
I
tried
email
-
every
address
they
send
from
is
set
to
not
receive
incoming
mail.
And
you
can
only
submit
one
ticket.
I
was
promised
a
call
in
24
hours
(too
late
already
to
remove
the
duplicate,
unneeded
item.
I
got
another
email
saying
"Your
transaction
went
through!
Yay!
Now
I
have
been
over
charged.
Then,
as
I
expected,
I
get
the
"Your
order
has
shipped!"
Great.
How
about
responding
to
my
multiple
attempts
to
reach
someone,
ANYONE
TO
PREVENT
SHIPPING
ME
A
DOUBLE
ORDER??
Nope.
Them
AFTER
I
get
the
double
order,
I
get
a
response,
and
TWO
DAYS
later
I
get
an
RMA
-
Guess
what?
I
have
to
pay
the
return
shipping.
Further
they
state
a
turnaround
for
RMA
of
30
DAYS!!!
It
took
3
seconds
to
debit
my
account,
but
they
want
30
DAYS
to
refund
me.
It's
a
load
of
BS.
Companies
like
Amazon
would
never
have
shipped
the
wrong
order
to
begin
with,
and
would
never
expect
customers
to
wait
A
MONTH
to

credited
for
THEIR
MISTAKE.
Never

I

chose

for

The
model
#
was
SDCZ3-2048.

I
selected
this
specific
model
in
my
order,
but
instead,
MemorySuppliers
sent
the
current
2Gb
model,
which
is
available
‘anywhere’,

at

I've
used
Bee
Packaging
several
times
over
the
years
for
my
shipping
needs
and
I
have
not
once
been
disappointed.
Usually
I
know
what
type
of
packaging
I
need
and
they
have
it
available
with
no
problems
but
one
time
I
knew
kind
of
what
I
wanted
but
not
exactly...and
the
salesperson
walked
me
through
all
their
products
until
we
finally
found
exactly
what
I
needed.
I
have
never
experienced
dedication
to
helping
a
customer
like
that
before.
Not
from
any
other
company
I
have
dealt
with
in
the
past.
Because
of
that,
I
use
Bee
Packaging
as
often
as
possible
for
all
my
packaging
needs.
No
need
to
shop
around,
everything
we
need,
great

the

I
wanted
a
rugged
regulator
at
a
1970s
price.
Outlandish
you
ask?

Diverightinscuba
sells
HOG
regulators,
which
carry
sterling
reviews,
and
their
prices
are
excellent.

So
I
jumped
onboard.

When
I
received
the
regulator
on
Christmas
Eve,

after
ordering
it
six
days
prior,
I
was
elated
to
behold

B&H
not
only
has
the
best
customer
support
of
any
photography
store
I
know,
but
in
most
cases
it
also
has
the
lowest
prices.
I've
never
had
a
bad
experience
with
B&H,
and
I've
purchased
a
lot
of
expensive
gear
from
them.
Plus
they
often
have
great
deals,
but
they
never
stoop
to
cheesy
hard
sells
or
silly,
flashy
advertising.
There
is
something
dignified
in
they
way
they
present
themselves
and
their
products.
I
would
rate
them
the
number
one
photography
store
in
the
world.
Prior
to
this
purchase
I
order
a
camera
and
delivered

accessory
and
had
many
to
choose
from
with
each
item
have
a
full
description
to
let
the
customer
decide
what
to
purchase.



Navigation
was
easy
an
to
the
point.


Plenty
of
methods
of
payments.
B&H
is
consistently
the
best
in
terms
of
service,
price,
and
reliability.
My
order
took
12
days
to
deliver.

And
thats
the
expected
date
of
delivery.

I
think
a
small
package
should
take
less
than
10
days
with
standard
shipping.

UPS
is
too
slow
for
a
good
company
like
yours.
The
prices
can't
be
beat
,shipping
time
and
prices
are
very
reasonable.
The
entire
experience
was
good.

were
good
and
my

early
I've

correct.
The
quality
of
the

from

reach

Very
nice
people
to

especially
Bernadette

does
everything
possible

B&H

been
around
for
decades,
and
they
set
the
standard
for
great
product

excellent

and
honest,
helpful
customer
service.
I
highly
recommend
them.
I
am

Never

I

this
site.

keep
up
the
good
work
guys.
Everything
was
perfect
apart
from
the
lack
of
information
on
what
date
it
was
predicted
to
be
delivered.
They
shippedmy
part
faster
than
they
even
said
it
would
get
here.
I
will
order
parts
from
them
again
when
needed.
I
have
used
First4Magnets
for
years
now
and
always
experienced
good
prompt
service
from
them.
I
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
magnets.
I
couldn't
remember
my
login
info
at
first,
and
their
nice
reps
helped
out
with
that
and
just
several
days
later
I
had
the
money
from
my
claim.
Super
fast.
Good
service
to
pick
up
at
door
and
drop
off
at
destination,
but
the
delivery
service
damaged
my
new
hard
travel
case,
now
as
a
problem
for
me
I
have
to
gothrough
a
process
to
get
it
replaced.
What
a
pain
in
the

I
can't
believe
how
easy
it

I
am
also
amazED
at
how
cheap
they
are
when
compared
to
what
I
have
paid
previously
on

Made

Both

As
a
former

I
am
impressed.
This
was
the
1st
time
I
used
these
guys
so
I
didn't
know
what
to
expect,

but
I'm
happy
to
say
the
part
arrived
3
days
early.
It
was
a
perfect
match
to
the
factory
original.
I
will
use
these
guys
again
without
hesitation!

Ordered
windshield
wipers
for
Mercedes
S-500
as
they
were
advertised
on
the
website.
Order
arrived
with
wipers
that
can
not
be
installed
on
S-500.
Contacted
seller,
sent
them
pic
of
the
wipers
needed.
Several
days
later
rec'd
order
to
ship
it
back.
Asked
for
pre-paid
label
to
return
item,
but
was
told
that
it
is
my
responsibility
to
return
wrong
item.
Tried
to
call
several
times:
no
live
support.
Company
itself
assigned
return
authorization
under
"Wrong
Item
Shipped"
title,
but
still
refused
to
reimburse
shipping.
Interesting,
that
one
email
requested
that
I
will
provide
them
with
part
item
number,
so
that
can
check
their
inventory,
but
these
wipers
are
still
advertised
as
for
S-500.
After
this
experience,
I
had
no
time
to
wait
for
another
shipment
from
different
online
retailer
and
went
to
dealership
to
by
wipers.
Package
arrived
promptly,

The
process
for
buying
things
is
too
long.
They
make
you
go
through
too
many
steps
to
verify
yourself.
Other
websites
provide
the
same
products
with
less
hoops
to
jump
through.
Your
product
is
very
easy
to
install
and
it
is
nice
to
have
the
speed
increase.

Great

Tim

Jim
were
great
to
work
with.
They
were
flexible
with
my
schedule
and
gave
me
a
bunch
of
options
of

I
love
that
they
text
when
the
vehicle
is
done
so
I
don't
have
to
wait
around.

A
great
experience.
Thanks.

Excellent

I
made
an
order
for
a
surprise
delivery
for
my
girlfriend
and
she
really
loved
the
flowers.
They
were
delivered
on
time
and
with
flower
food
for
her
to
keep
the
flowers
fresh
for
longer.
Overall
I'd
say
I
was
quite
pleased
with
the
service
and
I'm
gonna
keep
using
them
to
send
her
flowers
Although
I
was
generally
pleased
with
the
attention
I
received
as
I
was
purchasing
my
tires,
I
was
less
satisfied
once
I
came
to
pick
my
up.
After
purchasing
four
new
tires,
I
found
the
low
pressure
alert
still
engaged
on
my
dashboard.
Nobody
at
Town
Fair
had
informed
me
of
any
issues,
so
I
had
to
turn
around
and
ask
them
to
take
a
look
at
it.
When
I
finally
got
somebody's
attention,
he
told
me
I
would
have
to
now
purchase
a
new
sensor
for
one
of
the
tires
and
wait
up
to
three
hours
to
install
it.
So
after
paying
close
to
thousand
dollars
on
tires,
waiting
about
four
hours
to
get
them
put
on,
I
now
somehow
lost
my
place
in
line
and
have
to
spend
more
money.
Not
exactly
what
one
would
expect
from
a
five
year-old
car
with
brand
new
tires.
I
recommend
Global
Airport
Parking
because
they
are
the
best.
The
staff
was
courteous
and
helpful
when
the
item
I
ordered
went
out
of
stock
and
I
chose
to
get
the
same
item
with
a
different
color
instead.

Would
shop
there
again
and
will
recommend
to
anyone
looking
to
purchase
medical
equipments.
I
have
never
had
an
issue
with
Supplementwarehouse.com.
Always
competitive
prices
and
always
quick
shipping.
I
will
always
get
my
supplements
here.
I
told
your
representative
that
I
needed
to
upgrade
to
a
car
that
would
comfortably
seat
5
people
and
their
luggage.

She
said
she
had
the
perfect
car
and
I
paid
the
additional
fee.

The
car
was
small
and
uncomfortable.

She
also
said
the
car
had
a
small
dent
in
the
right/
rear
fender
and
she
documented
the
dent.

I
was
given
a
hassle
when
I
turned
the
car
in
at
Avis
because
of
this
dent.

I
therefore
will
not
give
you
any
more
of
my
business.
Price
was
good
but
I
was
very
put
off
by
a
50
euro
"airport
pickup
fee,"
which
should
be
made
VERY
Clear
when
one
is
purchasing
the
rental
not
afterwards.
There
is
only
this
one
good
place
to
secure
your
new
supply
of
ink
without
having
to
take
out
a
new
mortgage
on
your
home
and
this
is
it.

Further,
you
can
find
the
cartridges
that
fit
your
machine
without
have
to
wade
through
endless
links
trying
to
match
up
long
product
numbers.

Also,
you'll
receive
your
product
promptly
unlike
some
of
those
"others"
who
think
that
if
their
product
arrives
before
the
next
ice
age,
all
is
well.

Nuff
said!
So
happy
with
the
service
wouldn't
use
or
recommend
anyone
else.
Definitely
at
the
top
of
their
field.
great
service
I
ordered
an
automatic
transmission
cooler
from
partsgeek.com.
The
package
looked
intact
from
the
outside
but
when
I
opened
the
box
I
noticed
that
the
cooler
was
not
only
warped,
but
someone
had
bent
the
mounting
brackets
down
as
to
fit
the
cooler
in
a
smaller
box.
The
box
had
no
damage
and
the
brackets
were
strong
enough
that
they
would've
atleast
cut
the
box
had
it
been
damaged
in
transit.
Atleast
I
know
who
to
not
order
parts
from
now.
I
ordered
parts
from
the
website
very
easily
and
the
parts
were
at
my
door
2
days
later.
Very
fast
and
easy
to
work
with
I
would
always
suggest
World
remit
as
I
have
found
their
service
first
class
and
no
hassles,
Thank
you
I
have
bought
several
items
from
MemoryC
now
and
they
are
always
a
perfect
service.
Competitive
prices
and
quick
delivery
every
time
will
make
me
purchase
from
them
every
time.
The
fashion
sense
of
these
sun-readers
was
very
appealing.

I
found
the
site
attractive
and
easy
to
navigate.

Before
I
knew
it
my
purchase
had
arrived...much
quicker
than
I
expected.

They
were
smaller
than
I
expected,
but
most
lower-priced
bifocal
sunglasses
are
small
and
I
should
have
known.

The
frames
are
very
flimsy
and
the
reading
lenses
are
disproportionally
huge.

They
take
up
so
much
of
the
lens
that
they
make
it
hard
to
look
straight
out
and
not
through
them.

I
liked
everything
about
the
company
and
the
experience,
it's
a
shame
the
product
is
the
weak
link.
Have
not
received
part

Fantastic,

Enough

I
cannot
thank
the
guys
enough
at
MyOwnLabels.com.
They
were
absolutely
brilliant
from
the
fist
time
i
went
onto
the
website
to
the
speedy
dispatch
of
the
items.
I
requested
a
speedy
turn
around
and
that
is
what
I
got,
and
my
order
was
with
me
in
time
for
my
wedding.
I
wish
businesses
were
as
good
in
the
UK
as
they
are
in
the

A
huge
thank
you
to
all
involved.
Thanks

Priceline

I
saved

and
had

a
great

I
will
use

and
will

Thank
you

I've
used

Good

I
have
ordered
several
times
and
have
never
been
disaapointed.
Prices
are
great
and
you
receive
your
shipments
in
only
a
couple
days.
Only
reason
why
they
are
not
5
stars
is
they
are
high
on
shipping
costs.
It
seems
they
try
to
get
a
little
margin
profit
back
through
shipping
prices.
Love
shopping
at
ties.com
they
have
a
great
selection
and
great
prices!
Good
experience
when
I
was
getting
tires
for
my
truck
I
was
trying
to
get
the
best
deal
and
I
got
the
best
tires
This
was
my
first
time
using
Chewy's
and
would
definitely
use
their
website
and
service
again.
Great
info
on
all
parts.
Would
have
given
5
stars
if
they
accepted
"Bill
me
later"
like
tire
rack
and
autoparts
warehouse.
Work
as
expected
I
got
an
exhaust
manifold.
After
getting
it
and
checking
with
auto
repair
shops
on
the
cost
to
have
it
installed,
they
asked
me
a
question
that
I
was
not
asked
when
ordering.
That
question
was
what
size
motor
is
in
the
car.
Knowing
that
I
will
not
have
it
installed
before
the
30
days
are
up
I
sure
hope
it
is
the
right
one.
We
are
impressed
with
education
material
provided
and
the
concern
the
correct
product
is
chosen
for
our
particular
situation.

Marco
really
listened
to
our
concerns
for
future
events
and
then
provided
several
companies
that
provided
solutions

to
choose
from.
He
made
sure
we
understood
each
phase
and
was
happy
to
take
time
to
explain

in
a
manner
we
could
understand.
What
an
unusual
gift.
It's
just
that
amazing
that
you
would
buy
one
for
yourself.
However
receiving
from
someone
else
is
more
exciting!
Who
could
have
imagined
such
a
unique
and
powerful
gift
for
friends
or
family.
Wonderful
idea!
West
Coast
Shaving
indeed
sets
the
standard
for

The
abundence
of

products
is
amazing.

The
ordering
process
is
simple.

A
conformation
of
your
selections
is
immediate.

Orders
are
immediately
packed
and
to
the
shipper
within
hours.

A
tracking

is

a
very
short

I
live
in
the
US
and
ordered
a
Lavatube
from
ecigwizard
due
to
the
company
in
my
country
being
sold
out.
I
used
a
coupon
code
found
on
a
youtube
video,
and
selected
the
1-2
DHL
shipping.
Total
cost
was
still
less
than
what
I
would
have
paid
if
I
had
ordered
from
the
US
vendor.
I
ordered
it
Tuesday
night/Wednesday
morning
at
12:30
AM,
and
received
it
Thursday
morning
at
11:30.
It
is
a
great
idea.
the
idea
of
throwing
away
a
working
phone
bugged
me.
To
know
someone
is
willing
to
pay
for
it
is
great.
well
done
Read
your
review,you've
always
been
upfront
with
your
assessments
before
so
I
bought
this,
been
out
with
it
3
times
so
far,
average
8
miles,15
pound

easy

you
can
fine
tune
the
shoulder
straps
easily
for
a
good
fit
(i
don't
carry
climbing
gear,
I
am
using
it
as
a
walking
sack).
Should
be
o.k.
for
a
winter
daysack,
I
use
snowshoes
when
needed,
and
they
should
fit
the
tension
straps
easily.
Looking
forward
to
another
proper
winter.

Thanks,


Steve.
Can't
review
the
snowshoes
as
they
have
not
been
used
outdoors,(
they
are
pretty
good
on
carpet).
Fantastic
service.
Looking
for
a
replacement
shower,
the
web
site
offered
a
"replacement"
model
which
was
a
direct
fit.
The
on
line
Q
&
A
worked
giving
me
confirmation
that
the
new
model
was
the
one
I
needed.
Ordered
around
lunchtime,
unit
arrived
before
9am
following
day
(on
standard
delivery).
Price
was
also
the
cheapest
I
could
find
on
line
I'm
very
pleased
with
the
experience
with
PartsGeek.

The
parts
were
as
advertised
and
all
ship
information
was
provided,
never
a
question
of
when
they
would
arrive.

I
will
be
using
PG
in
the
future.
Good
items
,fast
shipping

and
great
prices.
I
ordered
a
mirror
for
my
Toyota
corrola
and
fits
perfect
,
I
will
buy
again
for
sure.
Winter
hit
and
my
wiper
blade
assembly
broke.
These
guys
had
me
a
new
one
in
48
hours,
$30
cheaper
than
surrounding
auto
stores
and
faster
delivery.
I
was
concerned
in
that
I
never
received
any
email
notifications
the
order
was
received
or
shipped.

A
simple
email
would
have
given
me
the
confidence
the
product
was
on
its
way.

The
product
was
great
and
delivered
as
promised
but
more
notice
would
be
a
nice
feature.
They
sold
me
a
part
that
wasn't
in
stock
(though
it
was
listed
as
in-stock).
Waited
two
days
to
inform
me
that
it
was
backordered.
Boo
for
you
Partsgeek,
your
poor
stock
records
cost
me
a
week
of
delays.
Especially
when
you
are
an
early
boarder.
always
got
fligts
and
rooms
at
great
prices
even
on
holidays
and
weekends
in
n.c
and
fla.and
va.i
have
no
complaints.
They
offer
an
easy
web
site
ordering
service
with
great
prices
and
very
fast
delivery
mostly
next
day.
The
quality
of
the
toners
is
excellent!
I
ordered
a
toner
cartridge
at
7:45am
and
it
arrived
the
same
day
around
3pm!
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
had
ordered
parts
from
Design911
and
I
have
to
say
that
their
service
from
website
ordering
to
delivery
is
excellent.
Good
quality
parts
at
a
decent
price.
I
will
definitely
be
using
the
again.
Please
read
above.
I
use
B&H
exclusively
for
my
computer
purchases.

I
trust
them
like
they
are
my
family.
Scott
Little's
customer
service
was
exemplary,
he
is
a
winner,
he
was
on
tune
with
every
customer
contact,
when
he
said
he
would
call
he
would,
he
did,
nothing
was
a
problem
all
throughout
our
interactions,
he
knows
how
to
build
rapport,
he
was
friendly,
courteous
and
very
helpful.


This
made
it
easy
for
our
company
to
go
with
Flashbay.

Well
done
Scott,
your
a
legend.
My
parents
are
going
on
a
RV
trip
to
Florida
from
North
Carolina
after
Christmas,
so
I
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
help
them
with
their
fuel
costs.
I
stopped
into
my
local
Kmart
to
purchase
several
gas
cards.
What
a
colossal
waste
of
time.
Seriously
one
of
THE
worst
customer
experiences
I've
ever
had.
I
spent
45
minutes
in
that
place
waiting
for
them
to
straighten
out
issues
with
activating
the
cards,
and
STILL
walked
out
of
there
empty-handed.
With
great
frustration,
I
left.
After
a
quick
Google
search
for
Gift
Cards,
I
landed
at
GiftCards.com.
In
less
then
5
minutes,
not
only
had
I
sent
them
a
Visa
gift
card,
but
also
had
the
chance
to
customize
the
card
by
adding
a
picture
of
their
RV
to
it.
Pretty
awesome,
and
VERY
reasonable
extra
costs
for
such
customization.
Love
it.
Will
be
a
frequent
visitor
and
user
of
GiftCards.com.
Easy
to
use
site,
vast
product
range
&
very
competitive
prices.
Item
came
on
time
and
as
was
described.
I
have
used
PartGeek.com
in
different
occasions
with
exelente
results.
They
always
have
the
part
I
need,
at
the
best
price
and
from
the
best
manufacturers.
Delivery
has
also
be
a
forte
with
PartGeek.com.
They
got
me
as
a
permanent
customer.
The
items
were
shipped
quicker
than
I
had
expected.

I
am
going
to
hold
off
on
giving
a
full
review
due
to
I
have
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
fully
use
the
items.


I
will
add
that
fifth
star
once
I
see
that
durability
equals
appearance.
These
guys
offer
quality
products
and
solutions
that
work
for
me
everytime.
If
ever
there's
a
problem
with
an
order
even
if
it's
not
a
hundred
percent
their
fault
they
go
above
and
beyond
what's
expected
to
fix
it.
It
just
works
for
me.
No
BS.
No
gimmicks.
Just
rock
solid
performance
and
the
absolute
best
quality
to
be
had.
Have
gotten
a
couple
of
suits
from
them
now,
and
really
love
the
finished
product
and
the
service
you
get
before,
during
and
after
the
purchase
GREAT
PRICES
,
FAST
SHIPPING.
I
bought
the
part
at
around
7pm
on
Sunday
night,
It
showed
up
on
Tuesday
morning
about
10
am.

Great

Super
fast

I
was
a
little
worried
about
ordering
something
so
big
over
the
internet
but
I
was
very
happy
how
fast

mainfaucet
got
my
order
out
and
how
fast
it
arrived
I
highly
recommend
them
B&H
has
got
your
back
through
thick
and
thin.
Their
customer
service
reps
have
always
been
friendly
and
ready
to
help.
Professionalism
at
its
best.
I've
had
two
orders
produced
and
I
am
completely
happy
with
the
results
of
both.

Not
only
the
end
product,
but
also
the
experience
of
getting
the
design
just
right,
produced
on
time,
and
shipped
right
to
me.
Ordered
radiator
hoses
for
my
duramax
gmc,
upper
was
o.k.
but
the
lower
was
unusable.
This
part
was
62.00
and
did
not
fit
well,
took
forever
to
install
because
it
was
not
made
correctly.
Drove
the
truck,
heard
a
noise
and
smelled
15.00
a
gallon
anti-freeze
and
part
of
the
goofy
hose
touched
the
cooling
fan
and
cut
it,
barely
made
it
home
before
overheating
and
being
towed.
Went
to
O'reilly
and
got
a
Gates
brand
for
89.99
and
put
it
on
in
10
minutes
(correct
bends
and
size
hose)
the
factory
holders
for
the
hoses
fit
and
held
the
hoses
from
getting
into
the
fan.
Well
worth
the
28.00
difference
in
price.
I
know
partsgeek
dosent
make
the
parts,
but
I
was
expecting
better
quality
than
that.
The
new
hose
I
got
from
parts
geek
is
in
the
garbage
can
now.
Email
response
for
question
is
within
24
hours,
pick
up
after
phone
calls
is
5
min.
NO
hassle,
no
hidden
charges!
I
will
use
them
all
the
time.
The
agent
knew
little
or
nothing
about
the
available
rooms
beyond
what
was
on
the
web
site.
Simple
questions,
such
as
whether
the
sofa
bed
in
the
room
was
a
double,
queen,
king
sized,
were
not
clearly
answered,
if
at
all.
That
example
actually
fall
back
on
the
Hotel
for
not
providing
the
information
either
on
their
web
site
(and
why
not?)
or
easily
available
to
the
telephone
agents.
I
was
told
that
I
was
very
fortunate
to
book
the
last
2
room
available
at
the
hotel
for
that
weekend,
however
I
have
several
cousins
also
staying
at
the
same
hotel,
and
when
they
spoke
to
the
reservation
service
earlier
in
the
week
and
in
the
week
prior
they
were
also
told
that
they
were
fortunate
to
have
booked
the
last
available
rooms
for
that
weekend.
Along
with
the
over
booking
(?)
issues
I
was
surprised
that
room
reservations
have
a
no-cancellation
policy,
made
even
>3
weeks
in
advance,
and
the
guest
will
lose
their
entire
room
fee
if
the
reservations
is
cancelled
for
ANY
reason.
In
my
travel
experience,
hotels
rarely
need
to
have
a
no
cancelation
policy
and
keep
the
entire
room
fee
unless
it
is
located
in
a
sketchy
area,
which
Eden
Prairie
MN
is
not.
If
the
hotel
is
actually
booked
solid
as
the
agent
said
told
me
and
several
of
my
cousins,
then
Marriott
is
making
out
like
bandits
with
double,
triple,
or
greater
over-payments
for
rooms.

Ultimately
my
complaints
are
primarily
with
the
hotel
and
not
the
reservation
service:
Simple
purchase.
Easy
and
fast.
Never
a
problem
with
B&H.

Love
the
free
shipping.

This
is
my
fourth
order
from
them
and
never
a
problem.
i
received
my
code
in
about
10min
or
less
good
quality
and
fast
shipment
thanks
i

will
buy
from
you
again
:)
They
did
a
great
job
fulfilling
the
order,
their
customer
service
was
awesome
and
the
shirts
I
ordered
were
perfect!
They
have
very
competitive
prices
and
quick
shipping
on
top
of
the
line
products.
They
are
my
go
to
for
tires.
From
now
on,
you
are
my
go-to
web
site
for
luxury
watches.
Thank
you
for
the
quick
delivery
of
my
Rolex.
It
was
brand
new,
authentic
and
a
very
good
price!
I
was
unable
to
get
my
PS3
remote
repaired
so
Square
Trade
authorized
me
to
buy
a
new
one
and
email
the
receipt.

Within
a
few
hours
of
sending
the
receipt
to
them
I
had
my
refund
via
Paypal.

Great
service!
Good
service
but
took
3
days
from
dispatch
to
be
delivered
by
post
2nd
class
The
product
was
delivered
on
time
with
a
phone
call
before
hand
you
can
not
ask
for
better
service
from
any
company
I
love
Goldstar.
Seriously.
I
find
fun
things
to
do,
shows
to
see,
and
discounted
concert
tickets
(my
favorite
part!)
all
the
time
to
keep
my
from
spending
yet
another
night
with
my
pal
Netflix.
I
mean,
Netflix
and
I
are
totally
in
a
serious
LTR,
don't
get
me
wrong,
but
I'm
not
entirely
loyal.
Goldstar
and
I
have
been
messing
around
n
the
side
since
late
2008
or
early
2009.
Goldstar
provides
a
lot
that
Netflix
doesn't:
fresh
air
form
getting
out
of
the
house,
social
interaction
(important
for
finding
people
to
watch
Netflix
with!),
and
a
reason
to
stuff
ear
plugs
in
my
ears
and
pretend
I
am
21
again
at
a
concert..
I
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
Goldstar.
Look
at
my
purchase
history--I
am
a
serious
long-term
customer
(just
don't
tell
Netflix,
please,
I
beg
you--it
would
end
badly),
and
I
value
your
service
a
lot.
The
only
thing
I
could
wish
for
would
be
more
comps,
and
more
concerts,
especially
small
venues.
ALso,
it
might
be
worth
knowing
on
your
end
that
the
best
feature
of
Red
Velvet
is
the
easy-cancel
feature.
I
have
used
it
a
number
of
times,
and
I
thank
you
for
it.

You
should
also
know
that
most
venues
do
not
have
a
clue
what
Red
Velvet
means
and

treat
Red
Velvet
customers
the
same
as
they
treat
other
customers.
They
typically
operate
on
a
first-come,
first-served
basis,
so
despite
being
at
the
top
of
the
list
and
identified
as
a
"Red
Velvet
Member",
if
I
get
there
with
25
people
ahead
of
me
in
line,
I
am
still
getting
the
25th
best
seats
in
the
house.
IN
other
words,
Red
Velvet
doesn't
mean
diddly
at
the
box
office.

Just
please
keep
doing
the
rest
of
what
you
do
so
well.
Oh,
and
one
thing
I
have
wished
for
for
years:
PLEASE
make
an
Android
app!!
Nevermind
apple
(iPhone
people
get
all
the
love--pffffftt),
just
give
us
an
Android
app
for
searching
for
tix
and
for
showing
the
purchase
confirmation
to
the
venues
instead
of
printing
one.
Found
a
decent
price
on
a
used
textbook
from
a
seller
on
Bookbyte--a
couple
dollars
less
than
on
Amazon.
Ordered
it.
Packaging
was
odd,
but
it
worked
(really
large
cardboard
envelope
for
a
book--you
could
have
put
fifteen
copies
of
the
book
in
it).
Just
not
very
environmentally
friendly.
I
guess
the
seller
was
responsible,
not
bookbyte
directly.
I
ordered
a
full
drivers
side
mirror
for
my
truck.

Couldn't
believe
the
price
was
that
cheap
and
it
arrived
at
my
house
in
3
days.
Very
good
provider.
Was
after
an
under
seat
sub
as
I
drive
a
convertible
and
the
roof
folds
into
the
boot
hence
no
room
in
boot.
I
researched
a
few
and
decided
upon
a
Kenwood.
I
proceeded
to
search
around
for
the
best
price
and
to
my
amazement
road
radio
where
the
cheapest
by
fat
even
beating
the
prices
on
eBay.
I
live
in
Northern
Ireland
and
even
so
I
received
next
day
delivery
and
was
able
to
track
my
order
also.
All
I
can
say
is
that
I
am
more
than
happy
with
the
service
I
was
given.
Thank
you.
For
my
first
order
from
the
UK
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
fast
my
order
was
processed
&
shipped.
Shipping
was
much
faster
than
I
expected,
&
packaging
was
still
intact
upon
arrival.
Cloud
9
Vaping
came
highly
recommended
&
now
I
can
see
why.
This
a
regular
order
for
pens
and
especially
refills.
Prices
are
really
good
and
they
have
always
been
in
stock.
Delivery
is
again
really
good,
and
well
packed,
so
postie
just
pops
it
through
the
door.
you
can
trust
this
company
They
have
all
the
supplements
that
I
like
to
take.

Most
of
them
are
stacked
together
for
the
price
of
just
one
of
the
supplements
supplied
by
the
company
that
makes
them.

They
have
fast
reliable
shipping.
I
ordered
the
parts,
the
order
was
confirmed
on
receipt
and
on
dispatch.
I
was
then
given
a
delivery
date.
On
the
designated
delivery
date,
I
received
an
email
giving
a
1
hour
delivery
window,
the
item
arrived
within
the
first
3
minutes
of
the
'window'.
Fantastic!
Would
recomendt
thes3e
guy's
to
anyone.
Some
of
the
best
prices
around
and
great
service
too.

I
ordered
a
set
of
wheels
and
they
were
with
me
the
following
day,
and
they
were
significantly
cheaper
than
anywhere
else.

What
more
can
you
ask
for?
It
is
not
everyday
that
you
feel
the
need
to
purchase
144
ping
pong
balls
for
your
sons
college
project.

I
searched
the
net
and
finally
settled
on
Millet
Sports.
Prior
to
purchase
I
sought
online
assistance
regarding
the
product
and
found
their
advice
friendly,
informative
and
helpful.

The
parts
arrived
within
a
few
days
and
were
well
packed
(although
it
must
be
hard
to
damage
144
ping
pong
balls…).


I
appreciate
the
good
service,
thank
you
These
folks
truly
have
the
most
terrific
service.

Easily
the
best
prices
and
the
fast
shipping
can't
be
beat…but
its
the
extras
(i.e.
unexpected
doggie
biscuits
in
your
order)
and
the
personalized
service
that
have
made
me
a
customer
for
life.
I
will
be
using
this
site
again,
today
actually.
I
have
bought
my
supplements
elsewhere
at
a
good
price
for
years.
I
have
found
a
better
price
with
perfect
service.
My
product
was
fairly
priced
and
(as
much
as
can
be
expected
from
a
supplement
shake)
tasted
good.

I
am

The

FUBAR!

No

no

2
weeks

not
what
I
would
call
good

and
I
don't
care
that
the

was
down.

I
will
probably
never

from

again
and
will

I
just
bought
a

at
Disaster
Relief

and
was
very
pleased
with
the
service
and
prices!

I
saved
about
25%
off

We
will
be
using
them
again
for
our
next
purchase.
We
are
very
happy
with
Tripshock.

We
had
a
vacation
over
the
spring
holiday
and
we
had
no
clue
what
to
do
when
visiting.

We
booked
a
dolphin
tour
and
massage
and
both
went
smooth.

The
dolphin
tour
was
located
in
the
Destin
Harbor
and
Olin
Marler
Charters
was
the
company
we
went
with.

The
staff
was
great
and
we
saw
a
ton
of
dolphins.

The
owner
even
greeted
us
and
had
some
nice
things
to
say!

The
massage
was
also
top
notch.

The
therapist,
Jen,
came
to
our
condo
and
delivered
a
top
notch
experience.

The
prices
were
reasonable
and
the
whole
process
was
flawless.

We
hope
to
use
them
again
next
vacation!
I
got
what
I
ordered
pretty
quick!
The

i
paid,
the

Absolutly

Having
twice
purchased

I
thoroughly
recommend
this

for
a

Easy

make
sure
the
order
placed
was
correct
and
progress
of
my
glasses
were
good.
Delivered
within
the
given
timescale
.
One
last
thing
is
that
you
will
be
hard
pushed
to
beat
Fashion

price.
I
would
buy
from
them
again.
Ordered

The

the

on

is
less
expensive
then

Overall,
good
experience....
don't
appreciate
the
fact
that
when
order
was
placed
it
showed
my
3
parts
being
shipped
from
3
warehouses,
but
in
fact
they
were
shipped
from
2
warehouses
in
a
total
of
2
boxes,
yet
they
charged
me
as
if
they
shipped
three
boxes.

2nd
item
in
the
one
box
was
very
light.

Should
not
have
been
charged
3
times.

I
don't
appreciated
being
gamed.

:(
Received
the
translation
requested
well
before
the
24
hours
they
told
me
it
would
take.
Good
company
to
work
with.
we
needed
a
lot
of
time
and
patience
to
find
an
appropriate
car
that
was
available.
We
were
afraid
that
the
price
of
our
flight
was
increasing
again
in
the
meantime...
But
the
range
of
possible
cars
to
hire
is
huge
as
well
as
the
flight
offers
so:
We
were
successful
eventually
-
and
happy
:-)

Online

easy
.
Installing

and
setting
up

was
a
cinch.

All
went
swimmingly

the

fell
out

and
diasppeared.
We
have
used

the

quick.
Never

so
have
no
experience
of
how
that

works
(and
hope
this

not
tempt
fate...).

Well
everything
from

They
kept

They're

I
found
the

off-putting,

that

I
see
no
reason
to
be

I
like
the

and
there
is
a
huge
difference
between

of
the

at
that
level
(sometimes
due

I
found
the

harsher

I
got
all
the

in

Well
Done.
I"ll
be
back.
Hey,
I
just
wanted
to
tell
you
how
impressed
I
was
on
your
overall
service.

My
wife
called
and
spoke
to
an
actual
person
instead
of
being
put
on
eternal
hold.

We
had
an
appointment
scheduled
for
the
very
next
day.

Our
installer,
Pete
called
about
an
hour
ahead
to
let
us
know
the
time
of
his
arrival.

Pete
arrived
on
time,
explained
all
of
our
options,
and
very
efficiently
able
to
use
our
existing
equipment
to
get
us
all
set
up.

Overall
our
experience
was
excellent.
Slightly
high
on
fees
and
taxes
I
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
thinking
of
boat
names,
and
the
DIY
site
was
very
handy
for
previewing
how
it
would
look.


Lots
of
font,
size
and
color
options.

The
online
ordering
process
was
easy,
and
shipping
was
very
prompt.

I'm
very
pleased
with
the
way
the
lettering
came
out,
and
would
certainly
buy
from
you
again.

Thanks!
i
received
m
code
about
ten
minutes
after
so
it
is
so
fast
and
secure
I
ordered
the
part
I
thought
was
right
but
it
did
not
fit.
after
I
gave
them
a
call
they
phoned
bristan
who
told
them
they
had
modified
the
part.
then
then
called
me
straight
back
and
said
they
would
post
me
the
replacement
with
a
returns
bag.
next
day
it
came
and
worked
perfectly
would
use
again
if
I
need
another
part
Service
was
very
good
and
email
back
was
superb
to
find
the
items
I
wanted
were
easy
and
straight
forward.
Would
certainly
use
again.
i
was
referred
to
this
site
quite
a
while
back
from
a
friend
and
never
thought
it
was
logical
to
sell
games
that
cheap
but
i
gave
it
a
shot
today
and
works
like
a
charm.
it
saves
me
the
trouble
of
buying
10
games
for
$1000
now
i
dont
have
to
leave
the
house
and
save
the
rest
of
my
money
for
mountain
dew
and
Doritos

I
am

this
company.
I
would
recommend

to

The
only
problem
is
that
there
are
too
many
choices.
So
many
that
it
took
me
many
days
to
make
a
decision.
There
could
be
a
better
way
to
make
a
choice,
i
think.
For
example,
a
psychological
profile;
something
like
that.
I
recently
purchased
a
latch
for
my
console
box.
No
problems.
Answered
all
the
questions
and
bingo,
there
it
was
Service
was
quick
and
easy.
This
has
not
been
the
first
time
I
used
PartsGeek.
There
was
no
change
in
quality
of
service..
Great..
Usually
went
through
an
electrician
to
get
these
bulbs,
so
much
cheaper
with
you
guys
and
probably
arrived
quicker

and
so
much
cheaper.
Got
4
bulbs
cheaper
than
2.
I
am
purchasing
a
ball
gown
dress
for
my
daughter.

She
was
impressed
with
the
great
images
and
the
video
which
helped
her
decision.

I
felt
good
because
they
provided
free
shipping
as
well
as
many
assurances
the
purchase
is
secure
and
the
gown
will
be
delivered
on
time.
I
bought
Borderlands

including

seeing

Wonderfull!!
Hard

you

I
CHECKED
OUT
OTHER

AND
WAS
ABOUT
TO
ORDER
A
SET
OF
REPLACEMENT

FOR
MY

RANGER,
I
JUST
HAPPENED
ON
THIS
"PARTSGEEK"

AND
WAS
AMAZED
TO
FIND
THE
SAME
PART
MUCH
CHEAPER
AND
THE
SHIPPING

LESS.
THE
MOST
AMAZING
THING
IS
THAT
THE
SHIPMENT
ARRIVED
WITHIN
A
FEW
DAYS
OF
THE

INSTEAD
OF
A
WEEK
OR
TWO.
THESE
GUYS
HAVE
MY

FROM
NOW
ON!!!!


(;-)
Thanks
Again
I
am
always
a
bit
apprehensive
when
dealing
with
a
company
for
the
first
time
online.
You
never
know
what
your
going
to
experience,
and
then
its
all
to
late
but
Cult
Pens
did
exactly
what
they
said
they
would,
Excellent
as
always.
The
shower
delivered
was
well
packaged
and
arrived
quickly.
Only
time
will
tell
on
the
quality
of
the
shower
itself
but
all
indications
are
that
it
is
well
made.
Name
your
own
price
on
hotels
is
awesome.

For
example
I
just
booked
a
hotel
in
Richmond
VA
20mins
before
checking
in
and
got
a
3
star
hotel
for
$70
+
tax.
The
hotel
was
great
and
was
worth
the
3
star
rating
and
then
some.

The
hotel
usually
runs
$120
a
night
to
$150.
Fast
service
,good
price,
and
works
great!
Would
not
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.

Let
the
buyer
beware
is
the
best
caution
with
this
company.

To
purchase
is
easy,
to
return
is
very
very
difficult
got
this
grill
for
my
16
year
old
sons
1986
chevy
k10
it
was
only
40
bucks
shipped
and
looks
great
he
was
very
happy
and
i
was
too
I
bought
a
guitar
and
accessory
pack
from
GAK
in
Brighton
over
the
Internet.
I
was
delighted
with
the
speed
with
which
it
was
dispatched
and
delivered.
That's
to
the
part
that
I
bought
from
you

Quite
simple
,
I
have
made
two

orders
and
they
have
both
arrived
at
the
arranged

with
no
problems.
I
will
be
back!!
Competitive

Would
recommend

Staff
friendly
and
well
organised.
No

experienced.
Bought
from
this
site
several
times
and
have
had
excellent
service.

Impressive
range
of

and
a
delight
to
deal
with.
I
will
not
hesitate
to
buy
from
BLT
again
in
the
future.
Ordered

delivered
with
no

for

like
me.
very
good

fast

unbeatable

with
no

I
listen
to
Joe
Rogans
podcast
a
lot
and
thought
I'd
give
it
a
chance.
I
utilize
two
separate
computers
and
printers
for
different
tasks.

I
found
the
ink
cartridges
from
InkFarm
very
compatible
with
my
Epson
Work
Force
30
printer,
and
equal
to
Epson
original
ink
cartridges.

I
have
no
fouling
or
cartridge
jams
of
any
type.

InkFarm
saves
me
money.
Easy
to
order
what
I
wanted
without
fuss.
Delivered
the
next
day
as
promissed.Ordered
over
the
phone,
served
by
a
really
friendly
and
helpful
guy.
BRILLIANT
Felt
threatened
by
late
charge
emails
before
they
should
have
even
been
thought
about!!!
Does
not
make
for
a
friendly
customer
relationship..
Would
recommend
Servcorp
for
an
Executive
Suite.

We
use
them
for
virtual
office
services
and
they
have
been
great
to
work
with.

Will

We've
used

for
the
last
3
years
and
find
it
easy
to
use
and
great
value
for

No

No

I
would
and
have
recommended
it
to
my
friends.
We
ordered
office
supplies
on
Monday
afternoon
and
didn't
receive
our
order
until
Friday
afternoon.
In

with
other
online
office
supply
companies
we
received
our
order
the
next
day.
Bought
some
Shimano
105
shifters
from
Merlin
-
cheapest
price
I
could
find
online.
Ordered
on
Sunday
eve
and
had
the

delivered
on

No
complaints,
will
definitely
use
again.
All
my
orders
are
filled
quickly
and
correctly.
No
reservations
about
buying
from
OFL.
Quality
of

excellent
and
after
sales
service
first
class.
I
ordered
lenses
for
my
daughter
from
Lenstore
and
it
could
not
have
been
easier.
I
have
used
a
number
of
Internet
companies
to
order
lenses
for
both
of
us
and
Lenstore
have
provided
the
best
service
to
date.
The
website
was
easy
to
use
with
no
requirement
to
enter
opticians
details
etc
and
the
delivery
time
was
exceptional.
The
lenses
were
delivered
within
two
days
and
I
did
not
request
the
"Express
Service".
I
will
definitely
use
Lenstore
again.
Couldn't
be
more
pleased
with
how
the
shirts
turned
out.

I
ordered
175
of
the
Sport
Tek
Lome
Shock
to
pass
out
to
our
Driver
Education
Students.

The
students
really
like
the
material.
It
couldn't
have
been
easier!
Delivery
was
one
of
the
best
'on
line'
I
have
experienced
Excellent
service
and
fabulous
stock.
Bought
the
Pilot
retractable
fountain

on
the
site's
recommendation
as
a
present
and
did
not
disappoint.
They
have
a
new
manager
named
Ron.
He
is
trying
to
make
the
place
better
than
it
was.
All
done
and
money
in
the
bank
in
6
days
always
a
great
deal
hotels
are
almost
always
very
nice
for
the

you
pay.
I
always
use
Priceline

my
rooms
while
traveling.
Purchased
several
engraved
trophies,
very
fast
and
professional
service
Very
fast
delivery,very
good
price,saves
me
a
lot
of
time
and
Money.
Selection
and
inventory
make
shopping
fun.
I
can
find
things
here
my
LBS
can't
seem
to
get.
The
website
is
easy
to

Pricing
is
competitive
and
most
importantly
the
dispatch
quickly.
Orders
are
complete
and
shipping
internationally
is
fast,

Excellent
provider.
I
purchased
an
Ultimate
Game
Card
online
and
I
received
a
response
within
minutes.
Very
easy
to
sign
up
for
and
purchase.
Viewing
product
info
and
the
checkout
process
was
streamlined
and
couldn't
have
been
easier.

Great
site
for
a
great
retailer!
I
was
loking
for
a
good
hotel
on
the
beach
for
3
days
post
cruise
and
found
Easytobook
through
Room77.
They
had
thebest
price
and
offers-
The
lowest
price
was
non-refundable,
which
was
fine
with
me
since
my
cruise
and
air
were
too.
But
they
also
offered
a
refundable
price
(of
course
at
a
small
increase
in
price)
I
can't
use
the
EA
Origin
store,
this
site
made
it
possible
to
but
and
play
BF3.
The
buying
process
was
very
simple
and
was
up
and
running
within
the
hour,
cheers.
Item
was
in
perfect
condition,
shipped
properly
and
promptly.
Would
do
business
with
again.
I
have
been
buying
in
this
store
since
2.000

a
pro

I

First,
they
carry,
in
stock,
a
hard-to-get

nut
for
my
1977
Land
Cruiser.
Guys
these
guys
are
legit,
I
will
definitely
be
buying
from
them
again.
I
placed
order
for
item
and
no
tracking
number
and
no
means
getting
to
the
company.
At
a
point,
I
was
scared
that
I
made
my
credit
card
known
to
a
scam
until
the
item
arrived
finally.
I've
used
rentbits
several
times
to
advertise
my
small
portfolio
of
four
units.

Each
time
I
receive
many
great
leads,
and
I've
always
been
able
to
lease
my
unit
in
under
30
days
on
their
platinum
package.

I
would
highly
recommend
this
service!
The
hardest
part
of
parking
at
the
airport
was
finding
the
parking
area
which
wasn't
that
difficult
when
I
followed
the
directions
provided.
After
that
it
worked
like
clockwork
I
just
rang
them
as
directed
and
the
car
was
picked
up
and
returned
without
delay.
It
was
great
not
to
have
to
look
for
enormous
car
parks
and
wait
for
buses,
"stress
free
parking"
just
as
stated.
I
have
been
searching
and
searching
the
web
for
decent
sunglasses
and
then
I
found
Sunglassjunkie.com.
Affordable
and
I
have
to
say
it
was
very
easy
to
decide
and
choose
exactly
what
I
wanted.
Quick
shipping
and
outstanding
quality.
Thank
you.
This
is
the
third
bike
purchased
and
once
again
first
class
experience
from
initially
phone
call
to
completed
quick
delivery.
Product
was
partially
defective,
but
was
installed
anyway
due
to
the
cost
of
turnaround.
My
parts
still
haven't
arrived.
I
can't
believe
it
takes
10
days
to
get
the
parts.
Your
prices
were
very
good.
Also
your
website
was
easy
to
use
one
of
the
reasons
I
tried
Parts
Geek
over
Rock
Auto
which
I
has
used
a
few
times.
I
do
some
side
work
at
home
but
I
usuallycan
not
wait
this
long
to
receive
parts.
I
ordered
some
Oakley
frames
with
the
Transistions
lenses.
They
arrived
fast,
in
excellent
condition!
I
will
be
ordering
my
Prada
prescription
sunglasses
any
day
now.
I
sold
an
old
MBP
13
inch.
The
quote
was
lighting
fast
and
cash
offer
significantly
better
than
the
other
offer.
Communication,
service
and
payment

were
all
outstanding.
I
look
forward
to
doing
business
again
soon.
I
never
look
anywhere
else
when
I'm
in
need
of
small
form-factor
memory
units.
I
have
never
had
any
problems
with
MyMemory
so
I
would
definitely
recommend
purchasing
from
them.
Definitely
the
number

I
was

not

pay

!!!!!
Excellent
web
site.
Brilliant
service
and
a
cracking
price.
My
package
came
in
today.
I
thought
i
ordered
my
own
coffin.
But
it
was
my
replacement
parts
for
my
car.
All
in
one
box
neatly
wrapped
and
protected,
and
the
better
part
was
that
everything
fit,
was
the
correct
part,
and
had
no
problems.
what
else
can
I
say


Great
service
-
Great

-
Easy
to

Quickly

Cheaper.....
Thanks

The

I've
been
using
Priceline
for
years
as
my
go-to
place
for
travel
bookings--both
domestic
and
international.
I
love
having
the
ability
to
bid
on
everything
from
flights,
to
hotels,
to
rental
cars.
I
would
always
suggest
to
the
user
to
use
priceline
to
get
a
deal
especially
on
hotels
and
rental
cars.
The
flights
are
a
little
more
dicey--I
think
that
the
prices
can't
change
very
much,
and
if
you
want
to
get
somewhere
at
a
certain
time,
I
wouldn't
suggest
bidding,
but
just
looking
at
the
prices
on

over
10
times
and
nobody
ever
ansered
the
telephone
after
I
let
it
right
for
over
10
minutes
and
I
email
to
inquire
about
the
status
of
my
order.

It
was
well
over
a
week
before
I
got
a
response
telling
me
that
the
air
filters
would
be
shipped
in
a
couple
of
weeks.

Terrible
communication
and
I
inquired
if
this
was
a
legitimate
company.
Very
pleased
with
our
purchase,
delivered
as
stated.
A
great
addition
to
very
good
service

OK,

HI,
Just
the
perfect
money
transfer
company
for
me.
I
made
my
intramural
soccer
team
shirts
using
this
site
and
they
came
out
really
good.
A
great
deal
and
the
online
creation
system
was
easy
to
use.
My
netbook
had
been
getting
slower
every
day
until
I
got
boostspeed.
Not
only
did
it
find
and
remove
a
bunch
of
registry
errors,
but
it
suggested
settings
I
should
change
to
boost
the
speed.
My
computer
is
running
much
faster,
even
the
internet
seems
quicker.
I
haven’t
tried
all
the
features
yet
but
if
they
are
as
good
as
the
ones
I
have
used
so
far
my
computer
is
going
to
be
faster
then
the
day
I
bought
it.
I
bought
a
cold
frame
for
use
in
my
backyard
and
their
model
was
very
easy
to
use.
The
self
opening
feature
is
amazing
and
makes
it
way
better
then
a
DIY
cold
frame.
The
sensors
tell
the
frame
to
open
in
order
to
prevent
overheating,
very
high
tech.
The
frame
is
very
sturdy
and
looks
a
lot
nicer
than
the
one
I
tried
to
make
on
my
own.
Perfect
for
a
small
backyard
and
a
low
maintenance
garden.
This
website
was
cool
and
full
if
information,
but
it
has
been
offline
for
a
while.
Very
disappointing.
I
recently
ordered
a
couple
of
band
t-Shirts
(Taking
Back
Sunday
and
Yellowcard)
and
they
are
both
perfect.
They
are
fitted
so
they
fit
very
nicely.
I
have
washed
them
each
once
and
they
seem
to
hold
up
just
fine,
I'm
glad
I
found
this
site
because
I
have
had
a
hard
time
finding
band
t-shrits
that
I
like.
Shipping
took
a
little
over
a
week,
but
if
you
read
their
shipping
terms
ahead
of
time
this
will
not
come
as
a
surprise.
I
will
definitely
be
buying
more
shirts
from

I
bought
some
beauty
products
for
my
girlfriend,
and
thanks
to
the
helpful
staff
at

she
love
them!
I
had
no
clue
what
I
was
looking
for
but
they
helped
me
pick
out
the
perfect
gift.
And
it
was
affordable,
I
will
be
keeping
them
in
mind
at
Christmas
for
sure.
I'm
starting
a
local

I
really
stink
at

I

and
the
design
quality
was
great!
158!

Very
helpful
people
and
they
are
all
great
at
what
they
do.
The
"Browse
Projects"
tab
on
the
website
is
a
great
place
to
look
and
see
the
quality
of
work
being
delivered,
don't
be
shocked
by
the
price
tags,
if
you
do
your
research
you
will
see
this
is
actually
very
cheap.
Don't
waste
your
time
or
money
with
any
other
graphic
designer,
you
get
to
choose
the
best
design
and
you
own
the
rights
to
it.
Very
happy
with
my
final
result!
Simplesite.com

easy

It

even

Not

I
ordered
a
set
of
4
struts
for
my
2000
Audi
A4
which
was
the
cheapest
price
I've
seen
anywhere.
I
got
the
parts
I
ordered
in
less
than
a
week
with
free

Can't
beat
that!
I
have
made
several
orders
from
SW
and
the
thing
that
keeps
me
coming
back
are
the
closeout
specials.

As
long
as
they
keep
those,
I'll
keep
buying
from
them.

Only
wish
they
had
cheaper
shipping
like
amazon.
Vr-speed

The

Ordering

as

picking
the
local
fitting
agent.
On
arrival
for

morning
fitting
at
0900hrs
the

was
crowded.
However
they
saw
us
straight

straight

I
was
initially
exposed
to

when
I
utilized
a
remote

to
remedy
a

problem.
They
installed
it
to
examine
my
PC.
Well,
if
it
was
good
enough
for
them
(and
they're
the
pros),
I
figured
it
was
certainly
good
enough
for
me.
I
have
not
been
disappointed.
My
PC
continues
to
hum
along
smoothly.
Thanks,

Website
and
ordering
were
excellent
and
simple
to

Eyeglasses

in

weeks

good
also.
I
have
asked
customer

about
how
I
can
make
adjustments
for
better
fit,
but
I
have
not
yet
received
any
response
or
acknowledgement
of
my

This
is
somewhat
frustrating,
especially
with
the
total
cost
being
over
$500.
I
want
my

to

as

This
was
the
first
time
I
used
a
parking
service
at
Newark
Airport.

Newark
Airport
Long
Term
Parking
exceeded
my
expectations.

The
quick
transfer
of
car
before
departure,
professionalism
of
attendants,
great
shuttle
service,
and
my
car
ready
with
trunk
open
upon
return
all
made
for
a
great
experience.
Service
was
fast
and
friendly.
I
used
bravofly
only
once,
but
I
am
quite
satisfied.
My
only
little
was
that
the
electronic
ticket
had
no
bar
code
printed.
This
did
not
cause
big
trouble,
though.
This
is
the
easiest
and
most
affordable
way
to
purchase
new
eyeglasses.
There
is
no
waiting
around
to
get
measured
and
probed,
the
customer
service
folks
were
incredibly
helpful
and
the
glasses
are
great!
Fantastic
range
of
products
(many
difficult
to
get
hold
of
anywhere
else
in
the
UK)
competitively
priced,
but
most
importantly,
the
best
service
I've
ever
experienced
from
an
online
retailer.
The
online

app
was
easy
to
use
and
the
service
was
100/%.
I
would
recommend
this
to
everyone
I
know.
Satisfied
with
the
end
product
but
you
have
to
wait
along
time
for
your
order.
It
takes
10
days
to
manufacture
the
glasses
plus
more
time
for
shipping
depending
on
what
option
you
choose.
After
ordering
I
found
my
frames
for
a
lower
price
somewhere
else
but
couldn't
apply
their
price
match
as
I
had
used
a
30%
off
for
my
lenses,
it's
one
or
the
other.
Service
was
great
though

and
the
optician
who
helped
me
was
very
nice.
It
is
extremely
easy
to
work
with
STG.
They
allow
you
to
try
on
jackets
and

with
no
restocking
fee
within
30
days.
They
have
everything
you
need
for
you
bike
come
track
day
including
race
bodies,
exhaust
and
even

You
can
even

steet

If
you
get
a

for
your

and
you
dont
know
how
to
put
it
on
there
is
generally
a

and
instalation
walk
through.

I
love
their
customer
service
the
only
bad
thin
is
the
wait.
But
other
than
that
all
of
my
shopping
for
both
of
my
sport
bikes
is
done
on
STG.
Great
prices,
awesome
discounts
that
really
help
us
since
finding
out
our
beloved

disease!
Very
costly
,
fast
approval
once
the
vet
approved
which
was
a
pain
but
Customer
services
kept
calling/faxing
til
finally
got
a
response!
I
was
really
happy
with
the
price,
the
quaity
and
the
quick
response
and
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
them.
It
only
took
a
few
days
to

I
had

Efficiency
plus!
Be
using

I
have
purchased
a
few
items
from

online
now
and
they
have
been
fantastic
every
time.There
is
always
contact
on
completion
of

and
contact
regarding

have
always
just
used
the
Free

option
which
is
always
within
48hrs.The
contact
on
the
day
is
excellent
to
give
you
a
time

not
have
to
wait
around
all

The
last
item
wa
just
a
week

and
I
was
given
an
original

0700-1900hrs.I
had
a
phone
call
at
approx
0730hrs
saying
that
they
would
be
with
me
in
about
20
minutes.
First
time
I
have
used

to
try

I
needed
it
urgently.
I
ordered

I

is
very

They

I
ordered
four
parts
,
everything
fine
except
one
oxygen
sensor
wrong
,
probably
my
fault
.
Was
able
to
get
exchanged
,
so
far
so
good
,
all
parts
worked
fine
.
Now
,
my
beef
.
They
have
no
phone
number
,
you
must
go
through
a
madding
e-mail
procedure
to
contact
them
.
They
also
seemingly
only
let
you
contact
them
twice
,
go
figure
.
Their
representative
did
call
me
back
and
was
helpful
,
but
again
,
no
phone
number
,
what's
up
with
that
.
It
also
seems
that
even
if
they
make
a
mistake
you're
stuck
for
postage
.
Hey
guy's
,
get
an
800
number
,
it'll
help
and
make
your
customers
much
happier
.
It
shouldn't
be
an
ordeal
to
contact
you
and
the
way
you're
set
up
at
present
it
really
is
.
One
more
thing
,
if
you're
not
going
to
take
calls
don't
list
an
800
number
that
puts
you
on
hold
for
ten
minutes
then
hangs
up
on
you
.
It's
like
getting
flipped
the
bird
,
not
helpful
.

I'm
on

I

on

yesterday.
Its
all
part
of

I

to
shake

Best

ever,
Period
!
Starting
from
the
easily
manageable
website,
the
great
quality
of
the
parts,
and
finally
the
promptness
of
the
shipping,
eEuroparts.com
does
it
all
of
it
just
right.
All
the
products
you
could
want
and
prices
that
will
beat
any
other!
Good
price
and
speedy
delivery
to
a
very
local
garage
who
were
only
too
pleased
to
fit
tyres.

Very
helpful
phone
staff.

Well
recommended.
Highly
recommended!!
Didn't
get
as
much
as
I
would've
liked
to
receive
for
my
old
phone
but
payment
was
inline
with
all
other
similar
service
providers
and
it's
still
hard
cash
for
a
phone
that
was
just
gathering
dust.
Very
reliable
service
though
and
a
speedy
payment
:)
I
expected
to
receive
in
a
week
but
was
really
pleased
with
the
part
arrived
in
two
business
days.

They
exceeded
my
expectations
and
I
feel
the
price
was
good.

I'd
order
dealer
only
parts
again
from
Partsgeek.
I
telephoned
to
make
an
enquiry
and
the
help
I
received
prompted
me
to
make
my
order
immediately.
I
was
promised
next
day
delivery
and
wasn't
disappointed.
I
would
thoroughly
recommend
Sunglasses
Shop
to
everyone
and
will
definitely
use
them
again.
I
purchase
a
hole
borer
and
auger
from
this
company
and
am
extremely
happy
with
the
way
I
was
talked
through
the
purchase.
I
then
received
it
by
courier
the
day
after
it
was
dispatched
and
a
day
earlier
than
expected.
All
in
all
a
professional
job
by
a
professional
company
and
they
will
be
my
first
point
of
call
for
any
similar
items
in
the
future.
Many
thanks.
I
recently
requested
previous
invoices,
which
were
not
listed
within
my
account
online,
as
I
required
them
for
proof
of
purchase.

I
subsequently
received
them
very
quickly
indeed.

The
customer
service
adviser
was
polite
and
the
emails
were
responded
to
promptly.

In
all
the
years
I
have
been
a
Wiggle
customer,
I
have
yet
to
receive
a
poor
service.
I
have
recently
replaced
my
inkjet
printer
and
therefore
wanted
to
source
quality
and
cost
effective
compatible
inkjet
cartridges.

I
came
across
3000rpm
online
and,
after
reading
that
in
excess
of
20,000
reviews
had
been
left
on
their
website,
I
felt
confident
enough
to
trust
the
products
they
were
supplying
and
the
service
I
would
ultimately
receive.

I
cannot
tell
the
difference
in
quality
between
the
original
cartridges
supplied
with
the
printer
and
the
compatible
cartridges
that
I
have
just
purchased
from
3000rpm.

I
look
forward
to
using
your
company
and
services
again
very
soon
indeed!
I
ordered
400.00
dollars
worth
of
parts
that
said
they
were
direct
replacement
part
all
except
my
cars
computer
wouldn't
reconize
them
therefore
worthless
.
Than
partsgeek
wont
responed
so
I
can
return
them
.
Never
ever
do
business
with
these
crooks.
Should
have
done
my
research
better
and
I
would
have
seen
there
is
no
direct
way
to
contact
them
See
above.
Everything
was
just
as
I
expected.
Went
all
the
way
through
booking

three
leg
journey
to
France
but
then
got
an
'unusual
error'
at
the
end
after
giving
my
payment
details.

It
was
sorted
within
a
few
minutes.

Two
other
things.

The
French
leg
part
of
the
fare
nearly
doubled
from
one
day
to
the
next.

Not
sure
why.

Secondly
last
page
of
pdf
tickets
was
garbled
but
printed
ok
second
time
through.
The
company
met
all
expectations.


Price,
product,
and
performance!

No
need
to
shop
around....these
guys
are
the
best!
Have
bought
many
superb
bargains
from
the
outdoor
shop
in
the
past
and
my
recent
purchase
was
no
exception.
However,
the
delivery
by
parcel
force
has
been
extremely
disappointing.
After
trying
to
deliver,
the
left
an
unintelligible
note
saying
my
parcel
is
at
a
post
office
which
simply
doesn't
exist.
So
using
the
delivery
code
I
arranged
for
re-delivery
using
their
online
tracking
system
to
the
same
address.
I
received
confirmation
of
the
redelivery,
but
it
hasn't
been
redelivered.
Again
I
went
online
to
arrange
redelivery,
this
was
3
days
ago,
and
no
they
still
haven't
delivered!
Exceptionally
poor
service,
would
have
been
better
sent
via
royal
mail
and
that's
saying
something!
This
is
the
cheapest
I've
seen
this
HP
Laptop
Rucksack
(including
eBay)
and
it
came
with
free
delivery
and
arrived
within
2
working
days
when
it
was
listed
as
delivery
in
4-5
days.
I
found
the
site
was
very
user
friendly.
Extremely
quick
-
received
code
in
2
mins
We
would
absolutely
recommend
PartsGeek
to
all
our
facilities.
Easy
to
book
online,
chauffers
were
polite
and
the
car
was
waiting
for
us
as
we
exited
the
terminal.

No
problems!
Pleasure
to
order
from
with
fast
shipping.
Ordered
a
lens
for
my
Dad
on
Saturday
evening
and
was
surprised
to
receive
an
email
on
Sunday
morning
saying
it
had
been
made
ready
for
despatch.

I
received
the
lens
on
Tuesday,
well
wrapped
and
packaged.

Delighted.
Except
for
the
customer
satisfaction
survey
which
demands
10
words
and
made
me
have
to
ponder
as
to
whence
10
words
purveyed
a
more
quintessentially
expressive
delivery
beyond
that
which
is
contained
within
"Top
Banana"
I'm
pleased
I
discovered
this
company
via
the
internet,
who
were
very
helpful
in
providing
the
chair
I
required.
I
live
in
Italy
and
am
confined
to
bed
most
of
the
time.
This
limitation
makes
it
very
difficult
for
me
or
my
wife
to
sorce
some
itams
we
need.
It
does,
if
we
purchase
from
the
UK,
make
those
purchases
more
expensive
due
to
the
cost
of
delivery.
However,
with
a
prompt
and
helpful
company
who
have
the
interest
of
their
business
as
the
foremost
consideration,
then
the
customers
are
the
people
all
employed
must
love.
I
thank
them
their
mission
was
accomplished
with
me.
The
website
very
easy
to
use
,
the
terms
and
conditions
are
clear
and
you
know
exactly
what
you
are
paying
for.
highly
recommend
to
anyone
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
Part
Geek
had
the
parts
I
needed
that
were
easy
to
find
and
make
sure
they
were
right
for
my
car.

They
also
made
it
easy
to
see
the
difference
in
prices
for
the
same
parts
between
the
OEMs
and
reliable
brand
name
vendors.

They
also
always
have
the
lowest
price.

The
only
drawback
was
the
time
it
took
to
get
the
parts.

It
was
a
few
days
longer
than
expected,
but
that
might
because
I
live
on
the
east
coast
and
they
deliver
from
the
west.

A
few
more
distribution
centers
might
be
needed.
I
ordered
2
parts
and
was
charged
separate
shipping
charges
for
each
where
one
item
was
so
small
that
it
could
have
fit
into
the
other

package
and
both
came
from
the
same
place!!
I
have
used

and

of

what's
not
to

De
website
is

en
via

kwam
Cosmox
als
goedkoopste
naar

Vooral
het
feit
dat
er

maakt
vaak

this

is
definitely
the
champion.
Good

of

and
good

I
often
shop
here
as
they
are
very
reliable.
Good
but
not
great.
It
often
shows
irrelevant
and
unverified
information.
I
use
this

to
order
some
hard
to
find
books
and
other
items.
They
always
ship
fast
and
securely
to

Good

I've
bought
a
few
small
food
items
from
Onnit.com
as
well
as
several
orders
of
Alpha
Brain.
I
love
everything
that
I've
gotten
from
Onnit.com
and
have
highly
recommended
it
to
a
lot
of
my
friends
and
family.
I
will
certainly
be
purchasing
more
in
the
future!
They
can
create
and
help
you
on
any
kind
of

used
this
company
for
all
my
labeling
on
my
electronic
ham
radio
projects...
I'm
impressed
My
dreams
have
not
been
the
same
since
I
started
taking
Alpha
Brain.
Then
I
tried
New
Mood
and
Shroomtech
sport.
Now
I
have
blissful
workout
with
intense
dreams
to
follow.
And
when
people
recognize
my
Onnit
Tshirts
it's
like
we
have
a
connection
that
nobody
else
knows
about.
Thanks
to
Onnit
I've
gotten
back
into

and

great
again.

the
quality

I
only
go
to

to
get
my
eyes
tested,
then
buy
online.

thee

a
multitude
of

from.
Then
it
is
only
up
to
you
to
decide
what

best.
The

were

I
enjoy
ordering
from
Bookbyte
because
it
is
both
cheap
and
simple.
I've
found
myself
settling
for
one
or
the

in
the
past...
As
a

full-time
I
have
a
great
appreciation
for
how
quick
and
easy
it
is
to
not
only
order
from
Bookbyte,
but
return

as
well.
I
will
continue
to
use
Bookbyte

I
have

Exavault

allowed

I

from

there
is
nothing
better
than
Exavault
for
assigning

Exavault

closely

the

The

West

The

is
well
laid-out,
everything

the

The
only
down-side
is
you
have
to

$80

which
seems
a

high,
although
it

He

I'm

Overall
I
was
pleased

There
was
slight
damage
to
the

from
an
overtightened
screw
which
had
cracked

of
the

However
this
has
not

It

It

The

Best

that

much

out

I
got

Thank
you
very
much.
i
took
my
laptop
to
be
fixed

at
3000rpm
the
man
who
served
me
was
very

honest
and
said
it
could
be
a
simple
thing
like
a
loose
or
damaged
wire
or
a
faulty
screen

i
also
like
the
fact
that
they
tell
you
what
it
will
cost
[approx]
beforeou
go
ahead
Amazing
how
technology
enables
you
to
view
your
order
once
your
loved
one
receives
it.
You
feel
confident
that
they
provided
the
services
they
had
promised,
and
what
you
had
expected.
You
order,
you
pay
and
it
arrives
within
48
hours.

Is
there
a
need
to
say
more
?
My
go-to
online
shop
for
all

a
large

Many

are
offered
with
free

which
is
a
great
bonus.

Excellent

I
recently
came
to
Southington
and
was
greeted
by
Mark.

He
was
professional
as
well
as
being
very
knowledgeable
of
the
wide
variety
of
tires.

It
has
been
a
pleasure
doing
business
with
this
location
&
will
keep
coming
here.

No
more
Waterbury!
I've
been
a
regular
buyer
from
Cult
Pens
for
several
years,.
They're
an
excellent
seller
in
every
way,
and
never
fail
to
deliver.
Highly
recommended!
The
part
I
recently
ordered
was
delivered
two
working
days
later
than
it
should
have
been
due
to
PartsGeek
sending
the
part
by
UPS
to
the
local
POST
OFFICE
for
delivery.
The
UPS
truck
comes
by
my
residence
between
8:30
and
9:00
am.

The
package
was
delivered
to
the
USPS
the
day
it
should
have
been
delivered
to
me.

The
USPS
delivered
the
package
to
me
late
the
next
afternoon.
The
whole
process
was
very
easy.

My
stuff
was
sent
quickly
and
I
am
very
pleased.

Great

Ordered

Can't

the

this
is
an
excellent
warehouse
for
supplements
I
ordered
a
full
groupo
and
other
parts
for
my
bike
build.

Merlin
had
the
best
prices
and
the
delivery
was
quick
as
well.

Trust
them
for
your
bike
build.
I
have
been
a
customer
of
supplement
warehouse
for
numerous
year.
I
have
always
been
able
to
find
the
best
deals
and
discounts
of
anyone
on
the
internet.
They
take
the
hassle
of
buying
supplements
online
out
of
the
picture
and
make
the
process
really
enjoyable.
Plus
the
additional
discounts
I
always
receive
by
email,
its
just
the
icing
on
the
cake.
This
is
the
only
company
that
I
purchase
my
supplements
from
and
will
continue
to
be
the
only
company
that
I
purchase
from.
Thanks
again
supplementwarehouse.com
for
being
my
own
source
for
sports
nutrition.
I
have
been
very
pleased
with
my
transactions
with
PartsGeek.

Good
prices
and
timely
delivery
of
the
product.

They
have
things
that
I
could
not
find
through
the
part
stores.

They
have
my
business
from
now
on.
Loads
of
quality
products,
easliy
accessed,
quick
service.
Chose
the
cheapest
package
of
frame
and
lenses
as
on
tight
budget,
very
happy
with
quality
and
style
for
price.
Clear
vision
and
frame
lightest
I've
ever
had.
For
less
than
£25
I'm
very
pleased.
Might
even
consider
some
prescription
sunglasses
for
the
car
at
the
price.
Easy
to
find
tyres,
costs
and
fitting
centre.
very
slick
process,
good

Saved

great
site,
easy
to

Very
satisfied
with
prices,
quality
and
delivery
time.
Brilliant
place
to
get
started
if
you're
planning
to
travel
across
the
world.
Great
recommendations
and
always
trustworthy.
After
years
of
using
the
same
supplier,which
usually
meant
three
or
four
phone
calls
before
a
competitive
price
was
quoted
every
delivery,I
now
make
one
call
to
arrange
a
delivery
at
a
very
competitive
price
and
very
quickly.
Add
my
experience
to
another
"lost
in
the
mail."

After
14
days
since
shipping
out,
I
looked
at
the
tracking
info
and
it
had
stalled
at
the
main
post
office
in
San
Antonio
13
days
earlier.

There
was
no
update
after
that
and
I
didn't
get
the
package.

Contacted
Redbubble
via
their
Chat
feature
and
was
told
to
go
check
at
the
post
office.

What
is
this,
1950?

My
neighborhood
has
plenty
of
shared
mail
boxes
for
parcel
deliveries
so
I
doubt
they
couldn't
fit
two
stickers
in
one
of
them,
if
not
my
personal
mailbox,
and
I
didn't
get
any
notice
for
pickup.

But
they
wanted
me
to
go
stand
in
line
and
ask
anyway.

Then
the
Redbubble
rep
told
me
to
give
it
another
5
days.

Look,
the
last
tracking
update
occured
30
miles
from
my
house
14
days
ago.

I
don't
think
5
more
days
(for
a
total
of
19
days)
is
going
to
make
a
difference.

But
in
the
Redbubble
universe,
I
guess
this
is
how
things
work.

Seems
like
a
lot
of
items
get
lost
for
some
reason,
but
since
they
couldn't
just
resend
my
$5.00
order
on
the
spot,
I
don't
think
they're
too
worried
about
customer
retention,
so
I'm
done
with
that
site.
I
wont
buy
from
them
again
I
needed
a
low
value
prescription
only
medicine
and
Vet-Medic
provided
a
fast
and
professional
service
at
the
best
price
I
could
find
online.
It
was
most
helpful
to
be
able
to
scan
and
attach
the
prescription
rather
than
having
to
post
it,
too!
I'd
never
bought
from
another
site
before,
and
was
always
a
little
worried
about
being
scammed,
but
after
I
made
my
purchase
I
was
contacted
within
minutes
and
given
exactly
what
was
promised.

Character
is
actually
leveled
and
can
be
seen
crafting
every
so
often
as
well!

Great
site,
100%
satisfied.

Will
buy
from
again.
This
is
the
sixth
time
I
have
used
AutoEurope
for
my
car
rental
and
I'm
am
not
what
you'd
consider
your
normal
renter.
As
an
"ALFISTA"
I
have
a
love
of
all
things
ALFA
Romeo
and
it's
a
major
part
of
my
trip
to
Italy
to
drive
the
latest
product.
Every
trip,
AutoEurope
and
their
affiliates
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
get
me
the
car
I
wanted
...except
for
this
trip.
Not
that
they
didn't
try.
It
was
just
my
bad
timing
that
EuroCar
was
switching
over
their
ALFA
Fleet,
sending
every
returned
car
back
to
the
barn
for
resale
and
the
new
batch
had
not
been
delivered
yet.
Their
service
was
top
notch
and
I
appreciated
their
efforts.
Not
heard
of
the
company
but
they
were
a
great
price
and
free
delivery,
placed
the
order
had
a
number
of
emails
confirming
the
order,
despatch
etc.
then
text
messages
confirming
delivery.
Service
as
good
as
Amazon
and
considerably
cheaper.
Will
use
again
and
recommend
to
anyone.
Not
used
kwik
fits
mobile
tyre
service
before
but
have
already
recommended
to
friends
and
family.
I
booked
at
short
notice
and
the
service
was
fantastic
as
they
first
of
all
sourced
my
hard
to
find
tyres,
then
turned
up
and
quickly
and
efficiently
fitted
them.
Will
definitely
use
again
next
year
I
would
always
shop
at
parts
geek
before
any
other
competitor
out
there.
They
offer
many
options,
secure
checkout
on
orders,
refunds
but
mostly....u
will
find
what
you
looking
for
at
a
discounted
price.
Just
bought
tickets
with
Viagogo
to
an
Eminem
concert
in
Ireland
in
August.
They
said
the
tickets
would
be
sent
within
a
week
of
the
concert...Got
me
a
little
concerned--anyone
had
any
experiences
with
them
and
European
Gigs
i
have
purchased
4
pairs
of
specs
from
SelectSpecs.com
and
the
service
i
received
was
second
to
none
even
though
the
spec
were
cheap
it
didn't
change
the
service
Molto
efficente.
Took
them
a
calendaristic
month
to
build
it,
although
on
the
build
page
it
said
9-11
days(working
days).
Everything
else
went
smooth,
they
even
dealt
patiently
with
my
anoying
phone
calls;
It
didnt
feel
like
they
had
something
else
to
do
and
need
to
hang
up
as
others
make
you
feel.
Just
got
Wofenstein
in
5
min,
aprox
£10
cheaper
than
Steam.
Great
car,
friendly
and
quick
service.
I
have
used
Barrington's
exclusively
for
a
number
of
years
now
having
had
poor
service
and
quality
issues
with
other
suppliers
of
similar
services.
Barrington's
have
never
let
me
down,
unlike
the
competition!
I
ordered
on
a
Thursday
and
I
payed
extra
to
have
it
shipped
to
my
house
with
in
3
days
and
then
I
waited
to
get
the
product
it
came
on
a
Friday
the
following
week
I'm
just
not
happy
paying
extra
when
it
didn't
come
on
time.
Supplement
Warehouse
has
been
meeting
my
sports
nutrition
needs
for
something
like

going
on
three
years
now.
When
I
first
started
using
them
they
had
a
lot
of
energy
like
a
new
startup
-
you
could
see
it
with
the
handful
of
confetti
and
random
unexpected
little
gifts
they'd
always
throw
into
the
box
with
a
large
order.
Now
and
then
they'd
send
you
the
wrong
flavor
or
something,
and
usually
would
make
up
for
it
by
sending
out
a
replacement
and
letting
you
keep
the
oops
order.
Nice!
Complete
order
came
in
from
the
various
warehouses
over
a
few
days.
All
parts
were
correct,
just
as
ordered,
items
were
packed
and
packaged
well.
No
issues
at
all.
Thought
I
was
reserving
with
Fairfield
Inn.
The
product
I
had
chosen
from
the
website,
based
on
technical
specifications
and
photo,
it
totally
satisfied
my
needs,
as
well
the
services
provided.
The
product
arrived
in
a
fast
time,
shipping
condition
was
excellent,
as
well
as
the
delivery.
Ordered
an
oil
dipstick
force
my
nissan.
First
off
found
it
quickly
and
wothout
having
to
put
in
to
much
info.
other
vehicle
info.
Purchase
was
quick
without
having
to
go
through
several
windows
to
complete
the
transaction.

Delivry
was
within
the
time
frame
advised
and
tracking
was
just
a
click
away.

Thank
you
Hi
I
do
alot
of
online
shopping
and
before
I
buy
anything
I
search
for
for
the
best
product
and
the
best
price!!
Always
read
customer
reviews!!
Anyway
as
I
said
Parts-geek
has
very
nice
selection
of
parts
what
I
mean
by
that
is
a
lot
of
different
manufacturers
and
I
believe
they
have
a
low
price
guarantee!!
Fast
shipment
also!!
During
installation
of
the
engine
mount
part
number
AM9280.
Discovered
that
the
out
board
bolt
hole
did
not
align
with
the
bracket
mounted
on
the
vehicle..This
delayed
the
installation
and
the
vehicle
was
down
another
day...purchased
a
drill
bit
and
reamed
the
hole
to
proper
size...
future
customers
need
to
be
aware,
that
AM
9280
engine
mount
needs
additional
rework,
this
is
not
a
OEM
part
and
it
shows......Good
Day
Got
exactly
what
I
needed
and
a
day
early.
Bookbyte
saved
me
money
on
a
book
that
would
have
broke
the
bank
for
me.
With
that
being
said,
I
will
keep
going
back
to
Bookbyte
for
as
long
as
I
can.
The
book
I
received
was
in
amazing
shape
and
is
almost
like
new.
The
part
was
new
and
worked
as
expected.
The
bonus
was
that
it
was
delivered
a
day
earlier
than
estimated.
I
was
also
impressed
with
the
communication
updates.
overall
a
good
experince
My
hilux
needed
4
new
tyres
which
is
an
expensive
undertaking
so
I
put
it
off
then
I
saw
blackcircles.com
advertised
at
my
local
garage
so
I
took
a
look.
The
website
not
only
gives
you
an
easy
way
to
pay
for
expensive
sets
of
tyres
but
also
gives
you
a
full
range
to
choose
from
I
recommend
it
I
dont
think
I've
ever
had
such
a
good
service
over
the
internet
before.
Not
only
was
the
next
day
delivery
on
time
I
was
informed
every
step
of
the
way
by
the
courier
so
I
didn't
have
to
waste
time
waiting
for
a
delivery
all
day
and
then
it
arriving
when
I
pop
to
the
corner
shop.
They
gave
me
an
hour
slot
and
arrived
within
it
so
by
10.30
next
morning
I
was
playing
with
my
new
toy
.
The
Vox

I

really
good

and
looking,
10w
bass
twin
speaker
amp
with
a
nice
range
of
tones
and
surprisingly
loud
for
it's
size.
All
at
a
pretty
reasonable
price
with
free
delivery.
Very
impressed
with
service
so
many
thanks.
Bought
something.
it
did
not
match
the
photo
on
the
website.
I
asked
for
a
refund
and
they
said
I
had
to
send
it
back
to
China.
So
I
paid
shipping
to
send
back
to
China.
They
kept
the
item
and
refused
to
refund
my
money
back.
They
have
not
responded
to
my
emails.
Ordered

I
initially
had

but
all

by
the

and
the

of
my

Terrific
product
and
a
terrific
value.

This
is
my
second
ClicGear
cart,

these
carts
are
bullet
proof!

I
sold
my
old
cart
to
a
friend
and
purchased
this
one
because
I
wanted
a
color
to
match
my
golf
bag.

Most
of
my
golf
buddies
use
the
ClicGear
carts
and
my
buddies
who
don't
use
ClicGear
wish
they
had
one!!!
Found
the
booking
process
quick
and
easy
and
the
price
very
competitive.
My
follow-up
query
was
dealt
with
really
efficiently
-
so
good
from
start
to
finish.
I
have
been
buying
from
them
for
years.

Great
Service.
The
whole
process
was
a
breeze
from
start
to
finish.
The
pricing
is
the
best
around
and
the
delivery
(despite
saying
3-5
days)
was
next
day.
You
cant
get
better
than
that.
It
actually
took

waiting
my

Extremely
well

no

An
all-round
pleasure
of
a

Recommend
them

anyone
wanting

to
charge
over
£3
to
ship
a
button
using
a
60
p
stamp
is
taking
the
mickey
I
made
this
purchase
because
I
was
trying
to
find
a
quick
gift
I
could
send
to
a
friend.
But
I
felt
like
I
was
purchasing
something
shady
and
ultimately
thought
I
was
purchasing
a
gift
card
made
out
specifically
so
that
the
recipient
could
purchase
something
from
a
particular
store.
I
came
to
find
out
that
it
was
just
like
a
money
card
which
disappointed
me.
I
can
go
on
about
the
job
Jeff's
guys
did
for
me.
The
installation
of
my
new
doors
to
basement
windows
&
new
windows
in
my
entire
home.

If
you're
looking
for
anything
in
home
improvement
i
would
talk
with
Jeff
first
.

He
surrounds
himself
with
good
guys.
The
service
is
outstanding
Great
price,
great
value
and
great
product
there
is
nothing
I
could
fault
country
attire
with!
The
transcripts
were
delivered
within
5
hours
and
the
quality
is
top
notch.

I
was
amazed
by
the
speed
and
accuracy.

I
will
definitely
use

again.
Very
happy
with

Unbeatable

part

so
quick
that
the
shower
was
only
cold
for
one
day.
Could
not
ask
for
better.
I
wasn't
sure
about
how
secure
the
site
was
when
I
stumbled
upon
it
but
I
went
through
with
it
due
to
the
LOW
prices
and
deals
that
they
were
having.

Needless
to
say
I
have
yet
to
look
back
and
haven't
walked
into
a
GNC
in
over
3
years.
I
had
a
very
pleasant
and
professional
experience
with
AutoEurope
when
booking
my
car--stateside.
I
can't
say
the
same
about
my
experience
with
Europcar
in
Italy--either
in
Milan
(where
they
stiffed
me
for
about
an
eighth
of
a
tank
of
gas,
claiming
the
tank
was
full),
nor
at
the
Florence
city
office
(which
was
overwhelmed
and
unequipped
to
deal
with
rentals
and
returns).
The
website
was
easy
to
navigate
to
the
right
product.

Ordering
was
easy
and
the
correct
product
was
shipped
timely.
I've
been
using
ShopTo.Net
for
all
my
gaming
needs
for
over
12
months,
and
they
have
never
let
me
down.
Every
time
I
order
from
parks

my
parts

TROUBLE!!!
I
purchased
2010
Mavic
Ksyrium
Equipe
Wheelset
which
were
at
a
very
competitive
price,
whilst
delivery
and
communication
were
at
the
highest
level,
the
product
came
to
me
faulty
as
front
wheel
was
not
running
true.
The
wheels
were
well
packaged
so
I
do
not
think
this
was
damaged
in
transit
all
though
a
possibility.
I
then
had
to
repackage
wheels
to
send
back
,
picked
a
delivery
slot
for
the
morning
stayed
in
for
the
selected
pick
up,
only
to
receive
phone
call
that
they
would
be
picking
wheels
up
in
the
evening!
One
day
wasted
not
merlin
cycles
fault
as
this
was
probably
just
my
bad
luck
.
Previous
purchases
with
merlin
cycles
have
been
good
so
i
think
this
is
just
a
one
off!
I
have
been
waitng
for
a
response
to
a
request
I
put
in
on

5/24/13
the
support
ticket
number
is
928728.

If
someone
has
a
minute
to
answer
my
quesion

It
would
be
very
helpful.
I
was
also
wondering
if
you
have
a
1.800
number
I
can
call
in
the
future
to
ask
questions
since
I
have
not
received
a
response
to
my
email.
I
ordered
my
Cold
Steel
plain
edge
tanto,Recon
1
from
Heinnie
and
it
arrived
the
very
next
day.
Their
customer
service
via
emails
and
also
providing
my
knife
so
quickly
was
a
real
joy
and
very
stress
free.
The
knife
I
ordered
is
excellent,as
is
all
Cold
Steel
products,and
was
exactly
as
I
expected,having
read
the
other
great
reviews
on
the
web
site.
Overall
I
am
very
very
pleased
with
the
service,
this
time
and
on
the
other
several
occasions
I
have
used
Heinnie
to
buy
goods.
Ten
out
of
ten.
Found
the
site
accidentally,
saw
products
had
good
reviews
&
good
prices
attached.
Service
was
of
reasonable
speed
&
have
nothing
to
complain
about!!
I
would
like
to
recommend
3000rpm
to
other
people
wishing
to
do
buisness
with
them.


My
first
purchase
from
them
was
on
ebay
uk
and
found
them
to
be
a
company
that
delivers
a
good
quality
product
at
a
great
price
quickly.
I've
only
had
one
problem
with
BH
Photo,
when
an
ordered
item
did
not
arrive.

They
promptly
got
on
it,
resent
a
replacement
without
delay.

All
shipments
have
been
fast,
even
the
freebies!
I
was
very
please
with
the
whole
experience
when
I
used
the
Wimdu
site
to
book
an
apartment
in
Munich,
Germany
for
Ocktoberfest!
The
apartment
was
exactly
as
described
with
no
problems
during
my
stay.
I
would
highly
recommend
using
Wimdu
the
next
time
you
need
to
book
a
room,
I
know
I'll
be
using
them
again.
Quick
service,
free
delivery
and
product
was
what
I
expected.
Yesstyle
has
a
lot
of
unique
styles
of
clothes
that
are
hard
to
come
by
anywhere
else.
There's
a
wide
selection
of
clothes
and
most
items
have
a
lot
of
pictures
to
really
get
a
good
look
of
the
item
you're
interested
in.
Also,
everything
lists
the
specific
measurements
so
you
can
really
know
how
an
item
will
fit
before
buying
it
based
on
it's
measurements.
I
have
never
had
an
item
come
in
a
bad
size
because
I
go
specifically
by
measurements.
Yesstyle
has
many
different
brands
from
Asia
with
high
quality
goods.
Definitely
a
recommended
site!
I
have
purchased
from
Yesstyle
many
times
and
will
purchase
many
more
times.
My
order
was
sended
whit
no
mistakes
and
arrived
one

before
they
promise
good
work.
Buy
with
confidence.
A
very
pleasing
web
experience
and
a
fast
delivery
of
the
items
ordered.
I
cannot
fault
them.
I
ordered
50

Service

excellent,
I
left
the

quite
late
but
was
fulfilled
quickly
and
arrived
in
time.

As
you're
probably
aware,
there
are
many,
many
places
to
buy
supplements
from
on
the
internet.
I
can't
say
I've
tried
*every*
online
shop,
but
I've
been
around
the
block
a
few
times
and
the
best
experience
I've
had
has
been
with
Discount
Supplements.
I
bought
a
set
of
fog
lights
for
my
2004
Saab
9-5
Aero
to
replace
the
old
pitted
ones
and
the
prices
were
between
$160-$180
a
light
everywhere
else,
I
paid
$103
each
with
parts
geek.
I
ordered
my
parts
on
Monday
and
had
them
Wednesday.
No
hassle
or
fuss
and
all
the
correct
parts.
I
will
shop
here
agin
for
sure.
Medisave.net
is
the
best
online
service
for
Littman
Stethoscopes
that
I
have
ever
used.
Well
being
a
long
time
shopper
with
shopto
overall
I
can
say
for
hardware
prices
and
delivery
they
are
1st
class.
This
place
has
great
prices
for
their
parts,
are
really
fast
on
the
shipping
and
are
very
courteous
to
their
customers.
It
will
be
the
first
place
that
I
look
for
parts
at!
No
key,
no
support,
no
money.
Happy
with
the
produt
.no
so
much
with
shipment
charges.
I
started
using
B&H
Photo
years
ago
based
on
online
recommendations
and
bad
experiences
with
some
other
vendors.
So
far
I
have
never
once
felt
burned
and
I
have
purchased
thousands
of
dollars
of
stuff
through
them,
including
a
Canon
5D
Mark
III
camera
and
two
"L"
lenses
,
various
other
cameras,
computer
accessories,
and
some
software
and
books.
SelfStorage.com
helped
me
find
a
unit
promptly,
reserve
it
and
offered
to
be
there
if
the
storage
facility
was
a
hassle.
Everything
they
claimed
to
do
was
fulfilled
to
the
max,
5
out
of
5!
keep
up
the
excellent
service!!!
I
would
recomend
parts
geek
to
everyone
I
have
worked
with
B&H
for
years,
and
they
are
fast,
easy
to
deal
with
and
have
great
prices
Item
was
received
promptly,
fit
great,
only
took
a
few
minutes
to
install,
and
the
price
was
a
fraction
of
what
I
was
expecting
to
pay.
It
was
quite
late.
I
can't
wait
10
days
for
a
part
on
a
car
that
is
my
principal
transportation.
That
might
be
OK
for
a
specialty
car,
but
this
is
a
late
model
daily
driver.
I
bought
the
part
local
and
installed
it.
I
will
have
to
send
your
part
back
to
you.
This
was
a
greaI
experience
and
I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anybody.
Delivery
speed
was
incredible
fast
and
received
e-mails
for
each
step
-
dispatching,
shipping
etc.
Good
products
One
part
was
described
wrong
that
I
purchased
and
they
would
not
exchange
it
without
me
paying
all
shipping
and
restocking
fee.
Three
other
parts
did
not
fit
at
all
and
I
asked
for
a
refund.
No
response.
No

Product
&

were
excellent

I
can
recommend
this
company.
excellent
service
and
product
I
go
with
my
gut
on
these
online
services.

First
and
foremost
is
pricing;
then
ease
in
ordering
online;
then
expeditious
service
or
time
in
route
of
part
and
final
is
condition
of
part
and
PartsGeek
won
my
approval.

I
may
even
go
to
5

if
this
keeps
up.

Thank
you

I
was
looking
for
a
particular
book,
Still
Life
by
Irving
Penn
(it's
a
photography
book
for
a
camera
'nerd'),
Ogma
were
not
someone
I
had
come
across
before,
but
given
their
website,
ease
of
use
and
value
for
money
offer,
I
decided
to
give
them
a
try.
I
was
not
disappointed.
The
book
arrived
ahead
of
time
in
perfect
condition
and
at
a
very
competatively
delivered
price.
I
can
certainly
recommend
them.
I
always
get
my
camera
equipment
here
because
I
know
I
will
get
the
best
quality
from
a
reliable
source.
The
airline
was
switched
to
an
unknown
airline
after
I
hit
the

Not
cool!
So
refreshing
to
be
able
to
call
a
company
and
for
there
support
to
be
based
in
the
UK!


Not
that
you
need
to
call
very
often
as
there
email
response
is
amazing.


There
website
says
there
customer
focused
and
they
are
and
for
an
amazing
value
also!
I
bought

read

such
amazing

would
definitely
recommend
this

to
my
friends
and
will
use
it
again
in
the
future
for
parts
thank
you
parts
geek
The
site
is
easy
to
use
and
it's
incredibly
easy
to
find
a
good
place
to
stay
because
of
the
rating
system,
which
from
my
experience
so
far,
seems
very
accurate.

I'd
definitely
recommend
it
to
anybody
thinking
of
booking
a
hostel.
Part

correct
but
had
a
small
crack
in
plastic
I
had
to
repair
with
putty.
Rubber

came
off
and
bare
wires
were
sticking
out.

So
I
Have
been
taking
these
products
for
a
few
months
and
have
definitely
noticed
the
difference,
especially
in
my
athletic
performance,
energy
levels,
alertness,
and
overall
well
being.
Would
recommend

The
service
was
good,I
also
phone
them
about
the

and
they
were
very
helpful
I
have
been
very
happy
with

and
the

excellent,thankyou.

PartsGeek
helps
ease
the
frustration
I
have
been
experiencing
with
local
parts
suppliers.
Because
of
the
economy,
it
seems
that
no
one
wants
to
carry
inventory
anymore.
As
long
as
I'm
waiting
around
for
parts
to
arrive,
why
not
order
them
through
PartsGeek
and
save
some
money?
Couldn't
fault
appliance
online
in
any
shape
or
form.
From
the
ease
of
the
ordering
process
to
the
delivery
of
my
washing
machine.
After
ordering
they
gave
me
a
call
to
confirm
that
my
order
was
correct
and
explained
the
exact
delivery
process,
them
they
updated
me
to
what
was
happening
via
email.
Got
a
call
from
them
on
the
morning
of
delivery
and
an
call
from
the
delivery
driver
to
tell
me
the
exact
time
he
would
deliver.
Well
impressed
with
the
whole
service
from
start
to
finish.
they
have
everything
but
not
open
on
weekends
This
was
my
first
purchase
from
Barrington
Sports
and
the
goods
were
as
expected
and
the
whole
purchase
experience
and
delivery
was
hassle
free.
The
part
was
an
exact
fit,
the
price
was
great
and
the
delivery
was
better
than
estimated.
what's
on
the
cruise
was
supposed
to
get
cruise
credits
did
not
receive
all
crews
credits
then
you
guys
were
going
to
mail
me
a
check,
haven't
seen
anything
still
nothing,
I'm
going
to
have
to
call
again
this
will
be
the
4th
time
calling
to
get
this
resolved.
This
company
provides
low
prices
and
provide
many
options
to
try
new
products
through
free
samples.

This
I
feel
allows
for
someone
like
me
to
feel
motivated
to
figure
out
what
products
work
best
for
my
health
and
work
outs.

I
highly
rate
Supplement
Warehouse
for
their
tons
of
options
and
fast
shipping
and
processing.
I
had
never
heard
of
shopto.net
before,
Now
I
am
sure
I'm
going
to
buy
through
it
in
the
future.
A
great
price
and
a
quick
and
smooth
delivery
for
a
great
game.
only
a
minor
issue:
I
did
not
receive
the
sms
that
would
have
informed
me
of
the
dispatch
of
the
order
i
find
it
utterly
amazing
that
i
can
order
a
bottle
of
tullibardine
20yr
late
one
night
and
be
sipping
it
two
days
later
half
way
'round
the
world!
This
is
a
good
place
to
look
and
see
just
about
everything
possible.
They
rep
all
the
quality
seed
companies.
The
data
provided
has
been
right-on.
I
looked
on
line
through
several
places
to
buy
my
contacts.

Opticontacts.com
was
the
best
price
for
my
contacts.

Easy
order
and
quick
delivery.

Thanks
I
will
order
again!!
I
am
so
impressed
by
the
workmanship
of
the
Stewart
Black
Kilt

I
ordered
with
custom
measurments.
They
were
right
on
the
time
of
completion
and
had
no
problems
with
shipment.
It
is
the
8
yard,
medium
weight.
The
best
kilt
for
the
investment
and
I
am
overjoyed.
Thank
you
I
have
ordered
stuff
from
Heinnie
Haynes
for
years
they
are
very
reliable
with
fast
delivery
and
excellent
communication
regarding
orders.
I
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
them.
Snabb

Mycket
nöjd!
Booked
a
hotel
for
Lissabon
that
it
was
supposed
to
cost
1080
EUR
and
when
i
was
done
booking
i
saw
that
my
card
was
charged
for
1110
EUR
instead!!
Even
in
my
confirmation
says
that
the
price
for
the
hotel
is
1080
EUR.
When
i
mail
them
they
said
that
they
want
a
bank
statement
that
shows
that
1110
was
charged
and
when
i
send
them
they
say
that
the
30
EUR
is
a
bank
fee
!!!!!!
Or
even
worst,
is
the
currency
difference!!
The
pricing
is
5-10%
lower
then
bodybuilding.com.
They
give
you
many
more
free
gifts
and
options
for
fore
"reducing"
your
shipping
by
buying
items
that
give
you
shipping
credit.
This
is
a
very
good
idea
in
my
opinion.
They
also
sell
items
at
a
discount
when
they
are
nearing
or
just
past
their
normal
"shelf
life".
The
website
however
is
very
difficult
to
navigate
unless
you
know
exactly
what
your
looking
at
and
looking
for.
The
item
descriptions
are
incomplete
at
best.
If
you
are
familiar
with
supplements
and
know
about
what
your
looking
for
then
it
shouldn't
be
much
of
an
issue.
Very
pleased
with
the
golf
trolley.
Dont
know
how
they
do
it
at
the
price
.Amazing
fast
delivery
.
A
very
satisfying
and
trouble
free
experience.
Easy
ordering,
good
prices,
quick
delivery.
No
complaints.
This
was
a
quick
and
easy
way
to
arrange
parking,
I
had
been
getting
these
e-mails
from
skypark
steve
for
some
time
now
and
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
used
them.
Was
looking
for
a
number
of
odd
ball
parts
and
PartsGeek
had
them.

I
had
checked
a
number
of
other
sites
and
no
luck
for
the
5
things
I
was
looking
for.

Will
be
back
for
sure!
Well
done
Lenstore
!
i
ordered
an
ac
compressor
for
a
2002
hyundai
sonata.
it
arrived
in
two
days.
happy
about
that.
installed
it
on
car,
started
car
and
ruined
accessory
belt.
at
that
point
i
had
two
choices.
call
and
send
it
back
or,take
the
pully
off
old
part
and
put
it
on
new
compressor.
considering
time
&
cost,i
chose
the
latter.
my
overall
experience
was
good,
with
noted
error!
i
intend
to
order
another
part
soon.
i
hope
i
hope
it
is
as
prompt
and
correct
this
time.
thanks!
Despite
me
having
zero
experience
with
producing
a
banner
the
website
can
do
this
for
you.
However
I
needed
something
more
in-style
to
what
I
had
done
for
a
poster
campaign.
I
sent
my
banner
image
and
was
then
given
advice
via
email
conversations
which
helped
no
end.
Their
patience
with
my
lack
of
knowledge
was
never
less
than
perfect.
The
outcome
for
just
the
one
banner
(I
was't
spending
a
fortune)
was
again
perfect.
Will
be
back
should
I
need
more.
I
bought
my
item
from
their
website
after
looking
at
other
websites.
The
item
I
bought
was
much
better
value.
Postage
was
reasonable
and
delivery
was
swift.
Every
purchase
I
have
made
over
the
past
5
years
has
gone
smoothly.
The
owner
was
very
professional
and
with
everything
going
on
and
having
my
2
little
ones
with
me

things
went
smooth
and
fast!
The
owner
was
super
helpful
and
polite
and
professional!
The
place
is
clean
that's
a
plus!
Great
experience,
my
price
dropped
when
I
purchased
the
item!

Now
that's
honesty
B&H
has
the
most
extensive
stock
of
photo
and
audio
products.

I
have
shopped
with
them
for
many
years
and
have
always
been
completely
satisfied
with
their
efficient
service
and
competitive
prices.
This
was
a
fantastic
experience!
Usually
very
satisfied-
but
not
this
time.

One
order,
came
in
4
boxes,
the
last
being
tracked
on
FEDEX
then
mysteriously
transferred
to
USPS.

I
always
confirm
FEDEX
since
USPS
does
not
deliver
to
my
house.

This
added
DAYS
to
my
order
which
cost
me
money.

I
bought
the
parts
elsewhere
in
the
meantime.

If
I
was
not
able
to
get
to
the
small
post
office
in
my
town
during
business
hours,
and
didn't
know
them
personally
they
would
have
returned
the
package.

Response
from
PartsGeek
was
merely
"
Thanks
for
your
inquiry"
No
apology,
no
nothing.

I
order
thousands
of
dollars
in
parts
each
month.

I
will
remember
this
service
each
time.
See
my
opinion
above,
but
I
do
expect
that
the
experience
will
be
excellent!.
Very
competitive
prices,
agood
range
of
stock
and
very
speedy
delivery
-
go
and
check
them
out!
Easy
to
use.
I
needed
a
replacement
mounting
plate
for
the
top
box
I
bought
from
CMPO
some
2
years
back.

The
knowledgeable
sales
person
on
the
phone
quickly
identified
what
I
needed.

The
new
plate
arrived
the
next
day
only
18
hours
later
-
all
for
only
£11!
The
balls
came
as
ordered.

One
star
off
excellent
as
they
took
about
4
days
to
arrive.

They
did
send
me
an
email
after
I
ordered
saying
the
balls
were
not
in
stock
and
there
would
be
delay.
The
part
was
easy
to
look-up
and
they
had
it
in
stock
when
no
one
else
did.
i
will
recommend
Parts
Geek
to
all
my
friends.
Man,
it
is
nice
ordering
parts
without
running
all
over
town.
It's
nice
Great
products.
But
very
slow
delivery
process.
Delivery
status
must
be
more
accurate.
If
your
products
isnt
in
store,
you
must
give
feedback
to
customer.
3-4
weeks
waiting
is
to
long!
Booking
was
straight
forward
and
price
very
reasonable.

I
normally
use
standard
airport
parking
but
decided
to
use
the
meet
and
greet
service
this
time.
15
min
from
airport
rang
number
provided
as
instructed
and
they
told
you
where
to
meet
their
driver.

He
rang
me
back
just
as
I
arrived
at
Manchester
Airport
as
I'd
taken
the
wrong
exit
from
the
roundabout
and
he
directed
me
how
to
get
to
the
meeting
point,
how
helpful
was
that!.

Very
friendly
and
professional
handover
whilst
dropping
off
and
collecting
the
car.

Definately
recommend
Stress

I'll
be
using
them
again
I
have
used

occasions
and
have
had

free
service
every
time.
Prices
good
too,
what
more
could
I
ask?
Ordering

Great

This
sight
was
a
rip
off
.
Too
high
and
would
not

Would
not

or

this
sight.
I
ordered
parts
for
while
my
Jeep
was
in
pieces
getting
warranty
work
done
at
a
dealership.

I
placed
the
order
at
almost
5
pm
and
paid
the
extra
$32
and
change
for
next
day
air
expecting
my
delivery
within
two
days.
I
was
realistic
with
the
expectation
of
not
receiving
it
the
next
day
as
late
in
the
day
as
I
ordered.
I
placed
my
order
on
a
Tuesday
afternoon
expecting
it
to
arrive
on
Thursday,

I
called
Thursday
evening
as
was
told
that
the
parts
were
scheduled
for
delivery
the
following
Monday
evening,
I
was
upset
and
after
talking
to
the
representative
I
was
eventually
credited
the
money
spent
for
shipping.

Although
the
parts
arrived
to
late
to
be
installed
at
this
time
they
are
what
I
ordered
and
I'm
happy
with
them
but
I'm
not
going
to
take
my
front
end
apart
again
to
install
axle
tube
seals.
I
used
to
be
very
impressed
and
happy
with
4wd
but
it
seems
that
after
the
merger
the
customer
isn't
as
important.
Ordering
online
was
easy,
the
website
is
user-friendly.
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
tires,
the
price
of
the
tires,
and
the
speed
they
were
delivered
to
me..
Thank
you!
20%
less
expensive
than
my
previous
vendor.
They
where
quick
to
pick
up
the
items,
which
I
was
impressed
about,
but
where
abit
slow
iin
payment
and
could
do
with
improving
communication
with
customers
(eg
emails
on
whearabouts
etc).I
would
use
this
service
again
though.
thank
you
giftcards.com
for
exixsting.
The
part
I
ordered
was
a
perfect
fit.
Thank
you
stockwiseauto.
First
Class
all
the
way.
We
used
Travelocity
to
purchase
airfare
and
a
hotel
room
in
Orlando
for
a
company
conference.
We
got
very
good
prices
on
the
travel
and
the
hotel.
We
flew
down
on
US
Air,
with
one
stop
in
Phoenix.
We
flew
home
through
Charlotte,
N.C..
The
flights
were
fairly
uneventful,
except
for
not
being
able
to
sit
together,
as
we
had
arranged
when
we
booked
the
flights,
from
Phoenix
to
Orlando.
Good
flights,
no
other
problems.
I
ordered
some
buttons,
sent
in
the
artwork
and
less
than
two
weeks
later
I
received
my
buttons.

Pulled
them
out
of
the
package
and
they
looked
exactly
as
they
should!

About
the
only
way
they
could
improve
service
is
to
give
them
away
(not
good
business!)
or
to
lower
the
shipping
costs.

Overall,
I
was
very
satisfied
and
will
order
more.
This
is
the
best,
thank
you
for
your
service.
Can't
beat
it
anywhere
and
makes
me
feel
appreciated
for
my
hard
earned
dollar.
This
is
my
first

i
was

with
the

as
well
as

i
hope
my
every
experience
goes
without

i
place
an

if
so,
you
have
a

for

Completely
satisfied
with
purchase
and

I
would
use

National

I
have

now
&
I
have
been
very
happy
&
satisfied
with
them.
I've
live
in
the
U.S.
&
all
of
my
items
have
made
it
to
me
safely
and
relatively
quickly,
considering
the
items
tend
to
sit
in
customs
for
a
while,
but
they
make
it
to
the
US
very
fast!!
I
wasn't
sure
what
to
expect,
but
I'm
very
satisfied
with
my
experience.
The
people
were
very
professional
and
I
got
my
iPod
back
kn
one
day
fixed.
I
will
definitely
use
them
again
and
recommend
them
to
others.
I

Great
Company,
After
being
shipped
and
delivered,
item
came
with
nicks
&
cracks
from
being
a
brand
new
item.
Freezer
arrived
promptly
and
the

were
great.

I've
had
about
15
follow
up

which
I
haven't

and
there
is
no

left
so
I
didn't
call
back.

I
trie
dthe

and
it
was

If

I

Holidays
please,
in
particular
Michelle
Jeynes
were
fantastic
throughout
the
whole
process
of
booking
our
honeymoon.

They
took
the
stress
of
searching
away
from
us
placing
it
upon
themselves,
making
suggestions
and
giving
insightful
information
through
every
step.

We
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
their
services
and
we
will
definitely
be
contacting
them
when
we
plan
our
next
holiday.
Your
limited
service
at
5
hours
is
way
to
greedy.
The
Obama
phones
already
give
us
4
hours
for
cell
and
that's
without
the
cost
of
a
modem,
ATA
and
internet
service.
The
fair
minimum
for
metered
service
should
be
at
least
8
hours
if
not
more.
$60.
is
too
high
for
unlimited
especially
since
I
believe
the
majority
of
us
would
not
need
the
one
hour
of
international
we
are
forced
to
pay
for.
The
web
site
is
easy
to
use,
prices
are
very
competitive
and
selection
is
great.
Especially
like
the
special

I
purchased

Always
informative,
and
helpful
in
assisting!
Thanks!
My
one
reservation
was
that
they
might
be
a
*bit*
overpriced,
but
they
treated
me
well
and
everything
came
quickly
as
ordered.
Web
site
is
easy
to
navigate
and
secure
placed
first
order,
wouldn't
ship
because
of
false
credit
card
verification,
placed
second
order
went
thru
with
identical
card
and
address.
after
unnecessary
verification
first
order
went
thru
and
products
and
shipping
went
perfect.
just
wish
they
hadn't
treated
me
like
a
looser
first
order
as
i'm
a
millionaire
and
am
not
accustomed
to
being
treated
that
way.
I
needed
to
phone
Cult
Pens
in
order
to
ensure
that
my
order
arrived
the
next
day
as
it
was
be
a
present.
Placed
the
order
there
and
then
and
sure
enough
it
arrived
on
time.
I
am
very
satisfied
Great
company!
fast
service.
wonderful
people
to
work
with.
great
place
to
shop
Products
superb
quality,
good
price,
ordered
3pm,
there
next
morning
-
can't
ask
for
more
than
that
!
Bought
some
105
groupset
parts
to
upgrade
my
bike
-
delighted
with
the
price,
the
speed
of
delivery
(next
day,
even
on
"normal"
post
!)
and
the
quality
of
the
parts.
Can't
fault
anything
so
far
!
I
ordered
a
black
ink
cartridge,
and
color
cartridge
for
my
printer.

The
color
works
good,
the
black
will
not
work.

I
have
not
heard
back
from
them
yet.

I
wont
be
buying
reused
ink
from
them
again!
Not
much
to
say
when
everything
goes
right.
I
have
placed
three
orders
and
have
had
no
problems.
No
shipping
charge
if
you
go
USPS
and
each
time
my
order
arrived
in
two
days.
Great
product...ankle
braces
for
my
son.
First
time
was
after
a
serious
ankle
sprain
in
a
basketball
game.
He
wears
them
every
game
and
practice
and
has
not
even
tweaked
either
ankle
when
wearing
the
braces.
I
spoke
with
the
doctor
and
he
said
no
problem
if
he
wears
them
whenever
he
is
practicing/playing
so
don't
listen
to
that
old
wives
tale
that
says
your
ankles
will
get
weak.
I
always
use
PayPal
for
buying
stuff,
it's
very
useful
and
keeps
my
bank
details
secure.
I
have
sold
a
few
things
on
eBay
and
using
PayPal
as
a
seller
hasn't
been
as
good
-
they
converted
the
funds
to
USD
and
then
back
to
GBP
when
I
transferred
it
out,
the
time
in
between
transfers
caused
me
to
lose
money
because
of
the
exchange
rate.
I
bought
a
necklace
from
Purple
Enchantments
and
found
the
service
to
be
very
swift
and
friendly,
and
included
free
sweets!
The
necklace
had
to
be
returned
due
to
an
error
but
Jo
was
very
helpful
and
rushed
a
new
necklace
out
to
me
immediately,
sending
me
a
return
envelope
and
refunding
in
full
any
postage
to
return
the
previous
item
before
I
had
even
posted
it.
Can't
ask
for
better
than
that,
and
I
got
a
personal
note
of
thanks
and
extra
sweets
as
a
thank
you!
Awesome
prices
and
on
time
shipping!
I
will
continue
to
order
my
herbs
for
hot
chai
at
Smiling
Brook
Cafe
Great
selection,
reasonable
pricing,
conveinient
and
fast
shipping.
Having
ahd
a
few
issues
with
other
online
retailers
I
have
been
very
pleasantly
surprised
and
impressed
by
The
Whisky
Exchange.

The
variety
of
products
is
very
good
and
I
had
no
issue
at
all
with
the
purchase
and
delivery
of
the
goods,
especially
as
they
appear
to
be
significantly
cheaper
than
their
online
contemporaries.
Quick
delivery,
well
packaged
and
very
easy
to
fit
onto
the
Xbox.
I
Would
recommend
I
had
a
great
experience
with
drive
time!

I
was
able
to
set
up
my
appointment
from
the
comforts
of
my
own
home.
Once
I
got
to
the
dealership
everything
was
already
ready
for
me
to
expedite
the
entire
process.
All
I
had
to
do
was
settle
on
a
option
that
was
best
for
me.
I've
been
using
supplement
warehouse
for
over
a
year
now,
purchased
countless
supplements
from
them,
and
never
once
have
I
had
an
identity
theft
issue
or
bad
service.

I
know
when
I
order
from
you
guys
that
my
supplements
will
be
to
me
quickly
and
that
my
credit
card
info
is
safe,

long
customer
here,
and
I
always
tell
my
gym
friends
to
order
from

warehouse
The
link
came
up
on
a
google
search
and
after
I
unblocked
a
couple
of
the
suggested
comparison
sites,
I
found
a
deal
that
was
by
far
the
cheapest
and
best
on
the
net.
ive
got
no
probs
with
them.
ring

them
up..
two
days
later
they
are
there.
great.

and

!!!!
My
order
showed
up
here
in
Charlotte,
North
Carolina
2
days
after
I
ordered
it.

This
was
excellent
customer
service.
Nice
and
clear
to
follow,
easy
questions
to
run
through,
usual
good
service!
Very
easy
to
deal
with,
both
on-line
and
when
I
needed
to
confirm
something
by
phone.
Courteous,
quick,
efficient,
friendly
-
great
service!
I
needed
to
have
a
possible
tire
repair,
but
do
to
the
location
of
the
puncture,
I
needed
to
purchase
a
new
tire.

Joseph
was
very
helpful
and
did
an
excellent
job
fixing
me
up.
Been
shopping
with
SW
for
almost
6
years.
I
have
always
been
satisfied
with
my
purchases.
Always
willing
to
help
out
a
customer
and
keep
my
satisfied.
O-rings
are
very
critical
to
a
sand
filter
so
I
was
not
sure
if
I
would
be
able
to
get
the
exact
right
part.

AmeriMerc
was
the
only
website
I
found
that
gave
an
exact
description
of
the
part
I
needed.

The
o-ring
seals
came
quickly
and
worked
perfectly.
Best
prices
by
far
that
I
found
on
the
internet
and
with
a
great,
quick
service
to
back
it
up
I'd
recommend
Topdollar
to
anyone.
Usually
everything
goes
pretty
smoothly
with
Wimdu.
One
thing
I
don't
like
its
the
abundance
of
people
who
won't
book
more
than
6
months
in
advance.
DONT
HAVE
YOUR
PROPERTY
LISTED
IF
YOU
AREN'T
WILLING
TO
RENT
IT!!!
I
received
the
parts
I
ordered
in
a
few
days
and
the
prices
are
vary
reasonable
Placed
order
with
partsgeek.com
on
Monday
morning.

Thursday
evening
they
canceled
the
order
with
no
explanation.
The
800
number
listed
in
the
email
never
leads
to
a
human.
Horrible
customer
service.
Great
savings
-
I
buy
only
"gift
amounts".
These
guys
are
great.
They
have
excellent
prices
and
service.
I
asked
for
a
change
to
a
kit
and
they
were
happy
to
accommodate
my
needs.
Highly
recommended!
Mega
Fast
Delivery
It
was
a
very
efficient
service
experience
for
a
first-time
user.
Can't
speak
for
the
returns
service
as
I
didn't
need
it,
but
the
ordering
and
delivery
was
spot
on.
The
courier
delivered
in
a
one
hour
window
on
the
day
of
my
choosing.
I've
given
five
stars
-
deservedly
so,
but
really,
isn't
this
how
it's
supposed
to
be?
This
is
my
second
purchase
from
Blackcircles
so
that
says
something.
Tyre's
are
easy
to
find
on
the
web
site
with
good
information
(though
not
always
the
cheapest)
and
getting
them
fitted
locally
at
a
time
to
suit
you
is
great.
The
fitters
also
were
quick
to
turn
the
job
around
and
didn't
try
to
sell
you
anything
else.
Good
communication
at
all
times
with
BC
and
changed
my
tyre
fitting
date
with
no
problems.
If
the
tyres
were
cheaper
and
with
this
level
of
service
BC
could
wipe
the
floor
with
the
competition.
Nice
web
site
..
👍👍
Thank
you
all
at
Trophies
and
Medals
for
your
help
with
ideas
for
my
two
recent
purchases,the
two
trophies
were
in-memory
to
my
daughter
Hannah
who
passed
recently
and
i
really
wanted
them
to
be
as
good
as
they
could
be
and
i
believe
that
is
what
has
been
achieved,also
i
required
a
different
finish/
shade
on
the

nameplate
which
was
dispatched
within
2days
without
added
cost;
The
2
trophies
will
now
become
annual
awards
for
my
local
CarlisleTri-club
10k
run,in
my
Daughters
memory...........A.Turner..

had
to
change
a
reservation-my
fault-But
they
were
very
nice
and
took
care
of
everything!
Associating
with
xicom
technologies
was
really
a
smart
move
for
us.
We
appreciate
their
professionalism
and
expertise
in
web
development
industry
and
their
turnaround
time
is
simply
incredible.
Our
website
was
delivered
with
authentic
quality
and
is
still
receiving
compliment
from
clients
across
the
globe.
We
are
impressed
with
your
trustworthiness
and
you
guys
are
100%
recommended.
Sure
the
price
of
the
product
was
good
compared
to
other
sites
so
made
the
order.
Delivery
came
on
the
day
I
chose
and
was
free
and
the
packaging
of
the
product
was
all
good.
Can't
fault
anything
about
the
site
at
this
stage.
Will
definately
be
using
it
again
in
future.
PhonePower
ensured
my
existing
phone
number
transferred

and
I
am
so
glad
I
mad
the
move.
I
now

etc....
Excellent
and
easy
experience
getting
liability
coverage
for
my
business.
Bo
was
great
and
couldn't
ask
for
a
better
person
to
deal
with
over
the
phone.
He
was
polite
and
informative
and
I
would
recommend
Bolt
Insurance
to
anyone.
I
received
quick
service
from
the
"aggresivehealthshop.com"
website
and
it
enabled
me
to
get
something
that
i
couldn't
find
anywhere
else
in
the
uk.
Fully
recommend.
Great

low

when
you

it

The
sheer

I

the

Good

Lots
of

Only
bad
thing
is
the
booking
fee
levied
for
using
a
credit
card.
Why??????
It
was
really
helpful
to
find
all
of
the
units
in
my
area
on
one
website.
The
online
specials
from
going
through
this
website
are
great
too.
Can't
beat
50%
off
the
first
month.
After
our
old
cooker
expired,
an
acceptable
replacement
was
proving
difficult
to
find
until
I
stumbled
onto
Appliances
Online.
I
ordered
a
replacement
a
little
too
hastily
and
when
it
arrived
I
discovered
I
had
made
a
mistake.
A
phone
call
re-assured
me
there
was
no
call
for
alarm,
I
simply
picked
a
replacement
and
the
delivery
company
swopped
them
over
at
no
additional
cost.
The
quality
of
information
regarding
delivery
was
unbelievable
and
any
future
purchases
I
make
will
definitely
be
with
Appliances
Online.
The
customer
service
is
the
best
I
have
ever
experienced
and
a
great
product
as
well!
Just
one
web
site,
a
few
clicks
and
a
keen
price.
AND,
with
a
few
other
local
orders
you
get
a
credit
which
you
can
use
at
any
time.
This
is
the
second
time
we
have
ordered
from
Flashbay.

Jill
helped
us
both
times
and
was
great
to
work
with.
We
were
able
to
upload
a
500MB
video
to
get
put
onto
each
USB
we
ordered
-
really
nice!
VERY
GOOD-
USE
IT
Ordered

for

,
Only

and
i
had
the

.
Great

Helpful
on
phone
discussion
of
what
was
needed,
rapid
despatch
Excellent
service
.The
right
part
was
delivered
and

then
fitted
by
me
within
24
hours
of
order
being
placed.
There
is
a
lot
of
competition
out
there
for
what
is
after
all
a
branded
product.
It
boils
down
therefore
to
price(delivered),
availability
and
speed
of
delivery.
The
clarity
of
the
ordering
process
is
equally
important
as
prescriptions
are
complex
and
individual.

In
my
opinion
having
compared
several,

this
company
ticks
all
the
boxes.
I've
used
Tennisnuts
to
buy
all
our
club
balls
for
the
last
3
or
4
years
and
have
found
them
to
be
competitively
priced,
quick
and
reliable.

What
more
would
we
want?
Fast,
reliable,
cheap.
Perfect
:)
Paid
for
a
return
trip
in
the
morning,
had
to
come
back
early,
paid
to
book
a
return
trip
at
16:00
hrs,
arrived
early
and
wanted
a
midday
sailing
and
they
wanted
to
charge
me
an
additional
£40,
Still
can't
believe
I
placed
the
order
at
15:00
hrs,
and
it
arrived
at
at
10:00
hrs
the
next
morning..
Good
Service,
Good
Value
Tires,
Quick
Completion.
The
sales
rep
that
I
talked
to
went
above
and
beyond
to
help
me
make
sure
I
ordered
all
the
right
parts
for
the
cars
I
was
working
on.
Mark
and
Co
are
awesome!

Completed
my
KB

library
and
ready
for
the
Summer!
Will
not
respond
to
direct
inquiries.

I
had
to
initiate
a
call
to
find
out
that
the
item
was
backordered
and
they
had
no
status.

You
think
they
would
have
noted
that
on
the
web-site
at
time
of
purchase.

Deceptive!
Waiting
to
see
if
your
return
policy
has
some
hidden
agendas.
I
ordered
a
part
for
my
car
but
found
out
that
my
car
has
older
engine
components.
I
have
filed
a
customer
report
but
haven't
heard
anything
back
from
them
so...I'll
see
Info
provided
was
timely,
accurate
&
a
total
surprise.

I
lines
me
to
order
on
line
again
I
picked
up
some
ingredients
from
BrewPS
and
as
a
local,
I
was
able
to
take
advantage
of
their

option.
Good

to

I

quick

would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for

The
quick

and
also
quick
response
from
the
receptionist
at
the
storage

helped
me
like
the
storage

for

use.
The
pricing
was
very
reasonable
also.
We
hoped
to
ride
the
bus
for
an
entire
circuit
around
London
.

We
had
to
keep
getting
off
the
bus
onto
a
new
bus.

Each
time
we
would
lose
our
good
seats.

We
spent
a

time
sitting
in
the
rain.

The
route

was
very
confusing
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
where
the
stops
were.

I

I
needed
sunglasses
that

suitable

generally
for

i
also
wanted
a
product
for

I
am
pleased
that
the
sunglasses
fitted
all
needs.
I
received
a
prompt

service
and
the
sunglasses
came
with
a
protective

Excellent
product

i
will

Unlike
the
Royal
Mail,
and
despite
a
5
day
delivery
time,
our
oil
was
with
us
first
thing
the
morning
after
the
day
of
order.
You
can't
get
better
than
that!
My
order
arrived
as
expected.
The
price
was
on
the
higher
end
of
what
I
was
expecting
to
pay
but
my
purchase
lived
up
to
expectations.
The
reviews
I
read
were
accurate.
I
am
happy
with
my
purchase.
Your
prices
are
good.
I
did
not
need
my
part
immediately
so
I
was
willing
to
wait
for
delivery.
Delivery
took
longer
than
advertised.
Trying
to
get
in
to
contact
took
forever.
No
body
answered
the
telephone
and
waiting
24
to
48
hours
to
get
a
reply
is
a
bit
much.
At
the
end
of
the
day
it
was
the
price
that
matters.
I
received
my
parts.
They
were
the
correct
parts
and
I
am
now
installing
them.
Thank
you.
I
have
used
eBuyer
a
few
times
over
the
years
I've
bought
on-line
and
always
found
them
competitively
priced
and
really
reliable.
I
wouldn't
hesitate
in
considering
them
for
anything
that
I
required.
I
saw
the
add
of
3
for
2
and
decided
to
buy
at
what
I
thought
would
be
a
bargain
price.
I'd
previously
bought
one
of
the
items
for
under
£20,
but
didn't
check
this
before
jumping
in
to
buy
3
more.
What
I
didn't
notice
was
that
HQ
Hair
had
jacked
up
this
price
to
£40.90
each!
I
paid
£81.81
(they
cleverly
worked
out
the
individual
price
to
be
£27.27
and
multiplied
it
by
3
-
it
should
have
been
£81.80
-
but
the
extra
1p
is
not
the
point
here).
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
NOT
VERY
LONG
AGO
I
PAID
LESS
THAN
£20
EACH,
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
MY
BILL
UNDER
£60.
Not
only
was
the
item
at
a
very
reasonable
price
and
arrived
very
quickly,
but
after
I'd
placed
the
order
I
realised
that
I
was
due
a
discount.
I
contacted
them
and
they
obligingly
acknowledged
with
a
refund
to
my
account.
Faultless!!!!!!
The
item
arrived
well
packed
in
double
quick
time.

It
was
exactly
what
I
wanted
and
the
price
was
reasonable.

No
complaints,
I'll
definitely
be
putting
them
on
my
favourites
list.
No
more
to
say
than
"Fast
delivery
of
a
top
quality
product
at
a
good
price
-
and
free
p&p."
Nothing
more
to
add.
Easy
purchase
and
internet
purchase.
Google
searched,
got
to
the
website,
selected

paid.
Hopefully
will
see

Brilliant!
Good
service
by
the
WE
as
usual
but
had
to
wait
3-4
days
for
alledgly
24
hr
delivery.
Pity
Appon
arrival,
the
shipping
box
looked
like
someone
stomped
on
it.
After
I
got
it
out
of
the
packaging,
I
noticed
the
grill
was
scratched
and
then
I
saw
that
it
was
broken.
I
was
able
to
fix
it
but
I
didn't
pay
for
broken
parts!
I
went
to
mount
the
corner
markers
in
the
grill
but
they
didnt
fit.
I
had
to
modify
the
mounting
points
to
make
the
corner
markers
fit
in
the
grille.
Once
I
tried
to
mount
it
on
the
truck,
I
had
to
force
it
on
there.
Most
of
the
mounting
holes
lined
up
and
it's
an
okay
fit.
I'm
not
happy
with
it.
Would
go
back
to
do
business
again
with
this
site...
I've
done
business
with
Parts

a
couple
times
in

so.

It
was

I
was

a
watch
for
my
wife
as
a
surprise
for
Christmas/birthday
and
I
found
one
on
the
Rebecca's
Jewellers
website.
They
held
on
to
it
for
a
couple
of
days
for
me
whilst
I
made
arrangements
for
it
to
be
delivered
and
when
it
arrived
it
was
exactly
as
described.
Excellent

This
company
was
so
fun
and
easy
to
work
with.
Again,
simple,
fun
and
great
quality!!
The
biggest
thing
that
is
can
say
besides
the
quality
of
service
is
the
fact
I
received
my
order

5
days!
Did
I
mention
that
I
am

Ya,

us
this

I
booked
a
hostel,
then
the
hostel
canceled
on
me
the
day
I
was
supposed
to
arrive.

They
told
me
there
was
no
space
and
to
refund
the
deposit
I
had
to
talk
to
Hostel
World.

I
did,
I
exchanged
a
few
emails
and
they
told
me
tough
luck.

I
want
to
be
clear
that
I
did
not
cancel,
the
hostel
canceled
on
me
and
Hostel
World
left
me
hanging.

Dont
give
them
your
credit
card
info,
I
no
longer
trust
them.
I
ordered
a

manifold
for
94
Buick
Park
Avenue,
Part
Geek
said
they
had
one
in
stock
at
$123.25

They
took
my
credit
card
and
notified
me
that
payment
was
cleared.

Then
4
days
later
they
say
they
are
going
to
refund
my
money
which
a
few
days
later
they
did,
minus
the
insurance
cost.

However
they
still
had
the
same
part
listed
as
"one
in
stock"
but
for
$149.25.
The
price
is
good,
but
I
wasn't
told
the
shuttle
was
leaving,
and
by
the
time
I
got
to
the
airport,
my
name
was
being
called.
The
plane
had
already
boarded.
They
were
waiting

me.
I

ALways

Great

and

Only
downside
shipping
is
expensive.
I
have
used
supplemental
wharehouse

since
2003.
They
have
always
been
safe
and
reliable.
Can't
ask
for
more
than
that.
Tried
compression
for
the
first
time
and
really
pleased
with
them.
Tight
for
sure
-
but
feels
great
when
working
out
-not
worth
being
conscious
about.

Love
it.
Games
are
cheap
and
the
support
are
fast
to

and
they
have

Have
used

They're

no
complaints.
Their
Customer

answer
quickly
and
are
always
helpful.
Will
use

the

Stratis
did
a

job
getting
me
the

some
work
but
he
did
it
and
pretty

as
well.

i

getting
the
car
that
i
wanted
for
a
fair

i
would
definetly

what
more
could
one
ask?
I
want
to
be
honest,
i
was
really
skeptical
about
this
method,
because
i
was
scammed
in
the
past
with
a
similar
procedure,
but
this
method
really
works.

I've
never

I
was
very
pleased
with
how
quickly
and
professionally
my
case
was
handled.
Today
I
received
my
first
order
from
MCM
Electronics.

It
arrived
on
schedule
as
per
the
tracking
information.

Everything
I
ordered
was
delivered
and

the
items
were
nicely
packaged.

Looking
forward
to
doing
more
business
with
you
folks.

Look
for
my
next
order
soon!
Best
price
and
in
stock
and
gets
even
better!,

Another
high

track
event
from
BaT
with
just
one
red
flag
all
day.
First
time
out
at
Oulton
so
getting
uninterupted
track
time
was
very
important.
Got
much
more
than
I
needed
and
managed
to
get
the
best
out
of
this
northern
gem
of
a
track
100%
recommendable!
Test
Equipment
Depot
has
a
great,
easy
to
use
website.
All
arrived
as
ordered
and
with
an
admirable
promptness.
It
came,
I
didn't
run
out,
just
wanted
it
not
to
be
7
days.
I
was
recommended
to
deal
with
Reidys
by
a
professional
friend
from
London
who
said
they
would
give
a
good
deal
and
deliver
free
They
did
just
that.
I've
ordered
for

a
number
of
times,
and
it's
always
been
nothing
but
satisfactory!
Definitely
recommend
Parts
Geeks
has
a
lot
of
great
parts
at
fair
pricing,
but
one,
they
short
paid
the
shipping
by
$3.75.
I
e-mail
them
and
have
never
gotten
a
response
back
-
what's
up
with
that.
That
and
the
part
I
ordered
was
the
wrong
one
My
bad
there,
but
the
refund
will
take
up
to
30
days.
Again
-
What's
up
with
that???
I
was
impressed
how
easy
was
the
service
i
had
and
the
quality
of
cars

i
was
offered
with
really
excellent
value.
Thanks
to
PartsGeek
for:
Received
the
wrong
part.
Can
only
contact
them
through
"support
ticket".
Did
so.
Received
e-mail
confirmation
that
I
will
be
contacted
in
24
to
48
hours.
It
has
been
7
days
still
no
contact.
I
have
made
repeated
attempts
to
contact
them.
Very
unhappy.
Simply
dreadful.
I
wanted
to
purchase
BT
Sport
on
my
Sky
TV.
The
automated
service
options
all
required
entering
a
BT
number,
which
I
don't
have.
I
was
then
re
routed
through
various
departments
and
had
to
call
back
four
times
to
resolve
the
order.
Was
told
the
channel
would
be
activated
immediately
on
placing
the
order.
Was
subsequently
told
it
could
take
up
to
24
hours.
Was
told
on
another
call
that
an
incorrect
viewing
card
was
on
the
order.
Rang
back
and
was
told
the
viewing
card
was
correct.
By
the
time
the
channel
was
up
and
running
I'd
missed
the
event
that
I
wanted
to
watch.
I
also
think
the
advertising
of
the
channel
is
misleading
-
no
mention
of
an
extra
charge
for
HD
or
a
hefty
activation
charge.
Later
in
the
day
I
reported
a
possible
fault
on
my
87
year
old
mother's
phone
line.
Was
told
I'd
be
rung
back
once
checks
had
been
made.
No
call
back
was
received
and
I
had
to
ring
again.
Overall
a
simply
awful
and
frustrating
experience.
Not
impressed
as
a
customer
or
shareholder.
Certainly
wouldn't
recommend
to
anyone.
I
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
places
you
can
go.
They
will
match
prices
but
usually
are
the
lowest
anyways.
The
only
thing
I
do
not
like
is
how
the
shipping
goes
up
with
small
(Free)
items
like
protein
bars.
You
literally
pay
for
the
bars
with
the
shipping
going
up.
Other
than
that,
I
usually
go
here
for
my
supps.
Rev'.com's
transcription
service
was
pleasantly
user-friendly.
I
can't

I'm
getting
my
transcriptions
back
so
fast.
I
crossed
checked
their
work
by
sending
them
one
on
which
I
had
already
transcribed
a
good
portion.
Their
transcription
was
right
on
the
money
-
very
accurate.
I
think
they
are
an
excellent
value
and
are
saving
me
a
great
deal
of
work.
I
will
be
recommending
them
very
highly
to
my
colleagues.
Very
fast
and
easy
The
customer
service
cannot
do
a
single
thing
for

They
just
send

day.
Haven't
been
able
to
use

I
have
a
cat
who
requires
a
limited
ingredient
diet.

I
had
been
driving
to
a
town
30+
miles
away
just
to
get
cat
food
until
I
found
this
site
online.

It
has
been
great!
THe
web
site
ordering
system
was
fairly
easy
to
follow
and
the
goods
arrived
very
quickly
by
a
carrier
who
advised
when
they
would
be
arriving.
What
more
can
you
ask
for
I
like
it
so
much
that
I
use
it
a
lot.
Ordering
the
wheel
hub
assembly
from
PartsGeek
saved
me
about
30%-35%
from
what
the
local,
generic
parts
store
would
have
charged
and
probably
100%
off
dealership
prices.
This
was
my
first
order
with
PartsGeek
(usually
use
RockAuto)
and
I
have
zero
complaints.
In
fact,
I
already
recommended
them
to
a
friend
and
my
cousin
as
well.
Well
worth
the
money
and
very
informative.
Hey,
loved
the
interaction
with
David
on
getting
these
reservations
!!!

David
was
great
and
professional.

Thanks
for
all
the
invaluable
assistance.
Well
pleased
with
this
website
and
the
prices
are
outstanding
along
with
free
shipping.
I
will
definately
use
this
site
again.
It
took
a
few
days
longer
than
I
expected,
but
the
ink
package
finally
showed
up.
Loaded
the
ink,
pushed
the
button,
and
success
in
the
form
of
a
printed
page.
Could
not
be
happier.
If
you
don't
need
it
immediately,
this
is
the
place
to
go.
Good
service
at
a
reasonable
price.
delivery.com
is
great.

the
website
is
user
friendly,
and
they
have
a
good
selection
of
restaurants
to
choose
from.

i
also
appreciate
the
frequent
deals
they
offer!
But
in
the
end
I
looked
at
the
website
for
booking
-
and
all
went
nice
an
smoothly.
I
can
always
count
on
FRC
Logistics
to
take
care
of
my
shipments.
Not
only
do
I
get
vary
good
rates,
but
the
staff
there
has
to
be
just
about
the
nicest,
more
pleasant
,
and
helpful
lot
I
have
ever
come
across.
My
own
company
has
a
thing
or
two
to
learn
from
them.
Always
professional,
polite,
and
they
get
the
job
done
every
time.
You
have
my
business
for
years
to
come!
As
above:
Satisfactory
procedure.
I
was
surprised
to
find
such
a
difference
among
online
parts
stores.
After
entering
my
information
I
received
many
offers
to
fill
my
order
and
most
were
3
times
the
price.

The
part
arrived
within
the
promised
time
and
there
were
no
problems
whatever.
Perfect
service
every
time.
Fast,
reliable,
helpful,
well
packaged,
quick
to
answer
any
questions,
will
go
out
of
their
way.
Cannot
say
better
than
above!
It
took
me
three
weeks
to
receive
my
package
due
to
errors
with
the
shipping
company.

However,
the
customer
service
was
great
especially
with
the
instant
messaging.

It
took
me
less
than
two
minutes
to
resolve
the
problem
and
I
have
a
tentative
date
for
when
the
package
will
arrive!
Use
4wheel.com
Extremely
fast
shipping.
Excellent
service,
excellent
product.
Had
what
I
was
looking
for
and
easy
to
get
around
the
website!
great
quality
fresh
food
with
a
fast
delivery
Lovely
furniture,
and
excellent
quality.
The
ability
to
choose
a
delivery
that
suited
us
was
brilliant.
Very
competitive
pricing
on
the
Tamari
nuts
and
they
came
packed
quite
well.
And
it
turns
out
the
product
tastes
great.
My
veloped
took
a
little
time
to
adjust
to
but
has
now
become
an
important
aid
to
my
fitness
and
independence!!!
I
recently
purchased
two
loose
diamonds
from
Brilliance
to
upgrade
my
wife's
diamond
for
her
engagement
ring,
and
then
to
get
a
similar
diamond
to
make
earrings
for
her.

I
purchased
a
1.17
carat
round
diamond
to
match
her
old
engagement
ring
diamond
for
earrings
as
well
as
a
1.75
carat
round
diamond
for
her
engagement
ring.

Both
diamonds
were
EGL,
D
color,
SI3
clarity.

I
couldn't
be
happier
with
the
purchase.

In
total,
I
paid
30%
less
than
any
other
diamond
broker
I
spoke
with.

My
wife
loves
new
earrings
that
I
had
made
and
has
not
taken
them
out.

She
has
received
many
compliments
on
both
the
earrings
as
well
as
on
the
engagement
ring.

I
will
absolutely
be
recommending
Brilliance
to
my
buddies
as
well
as
using
Brilliance
for
any
future
loose
stone
purchases
that
I
make.

The
customer
service
was
informative
in
describing
what
the
stones
would
look
like.

I
can
say
that
both
stones
are
completely
colorless
and
look
fantastic.

I'm
sure
that
a
lot
of
people
think
that
I
probably
spent
a
lot
of
money
($20k+,
when
in
fact
I
spent
less
than
half).

The
joke
is
on
them
for
paying
too
much
with
diamond
retailers
who
cannot
pass
savings
along
to
their
customers.
Since
I
have
gotten
into
wet
shaving
I've
used
a
few
local
sellers
and
a
few
online.
No
one
had
the
selection,
price,
or
customer
care
that
West
Coast
Shaving
has.
I
will
not
buy
from
anyone
else.
I
found
a
great
deal
on
a
storage
space,
and
more
sizes
to
choose
from,
at
SpareFoot.
I
booked
the
space
without
paying
a
dime
and
shortly
after
was
contacted
by
the
storage
facility.
The
whole
process
was
faultless.
Bought
two
parts
over
a
couple
of
weeks
from
Design911.
They
price
was
good
the
service
better,
I
will
no
doubt
use
them
again.
Best
service
that
I
could
have
ever
expected!
First
class
I've
ordered
from
these
folks
for
the
past
two
years
and
have
been
consistently
impressed
with
their
coffee
quality
as
well
as
their
responsiveness.
The
capsules
always
arrive
in
a
timely
fashion
and
are
inexpensive
enough
that
I
typically
use
two
of
them
per
cup
of
latte
or
capuccino.
The
early
capsules
were
a
bit
stiff
to
puncture
in
my
machine
but
the
more
recent
capsule
seal
they're
using
has
rectified
that.
They
are
now
printing
the
coffee
type
on
the
capsule
which
is
helpful.
I'm
still
amazed
that
a
company
based
in
Scotland
can
have
better
response
times
than
those
of
most
US-based
companies
I've
experienced!
I
don't
do
much
online
ordering.

This
was
a
bit
difficult.

However,
you
made
it
as
pleasant
as
it
could
be.
j
Excellent
service,
order
arrived
next
day
and
hinges
were
perfect
for
the
job.
The
right
item
at
the
right
price
with
fast
free
delivery
-
recommend.
I
was
really
surprised
how
low
the
prices
were.

I
was
expecting
to
pay
a
good
bit
more
for
stuff
I
bought.

It
arrived
a
day
or
two
earlier
than
I
expected
as
compared
to
other
online
stores.
Why
would
you
cancel
my
order
and
not
even
notify
me?
I
need
this
really
bad
and
lost
a
lot
of
time.
I
found
you
cancelled
my
order
when
tracking
it.
No
reason
to
cancel;
maybe
you
were
out
of
stock
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
going
round
asking
for
advice
and
costs
for
sending
documents
to
new
zealand
all
i
got
was
problems
and
huge
price
differences
but
with
parcelhero
all
i
got
was
ease
of
mind
collection
from
my
home
on
time
and
delivered
earlier
than
promised
and
so
cheap
all
i
can
say
is
thanks
Website
information
was
very
confusing
showing
part
being
"in
stock".

After
placing
and
paying
for
the
order,
it
was
cancelled
for
the
part
being
"out
of
stock".

After
contacting
customer
service,
I
was
informed
that
the
system
is
set
up
that
way
and
there
was
nothing
the
representative
could
do.

Also,
I
was
informed
that
if
it
shows
less
than
"2
parts
available"
it
means
that
the
part
is
"out
of
stock".
Easy,
fast,
liked
the
presence
of
many
user
reviews.
So
far
I've
found
Heinnie
usually
has
the
best
prices
available
for
the
UK
and
over
all
the
best
website,
customer
service
and
selection.
Always
my
go

site
as
they
provide
free
shipping
over
£30
and
fast

great
fun
as
a

for

in
this
brilliant
costume.
Easy
to
use
website
with
competitive

and
prompt

-
which
makes
me
want
to
shop
there
next
time
without
doubt.
I

is
fairly
straight
forward
but
you
get

if

Got
my

as

as
soon
as
possible
by

No
surprises.
Hitchless
transaction.
The
website
seemed
to
be
very
basic
and
did
not
allow
for
more
detail
on
the
hotel.
However,
it
allowed
me
to
make
the
reservation
I
needed.
Global
Airport
Parking
provides
an
excellent
value.
My
location
in
Tampa
is
enclosed
so
my
car
doesn't
spend
my
vacation
times
out
in
the
weather.
The
transport
to
and
from
the
airport
is
very
convenient
too.
I
use
Global
Airport
Parking
because
it
is
a
great
way
to
save
money
parking
my
car.
I
needed
a
replacement

very
quickly,
and
Hennie

came
through,
good

and
very
efficent

Recommened!
Let
me
start
out
by
saying
this
was
my
first
real
experience
with
Town
Fair
Tire.

I
have
always
been
loyal
to
my
local
NTB
Tire
center,
but
have
become
increasingly
more
frustrated
by
all
the
constant
"up
selling"
every
time
I
come
in
for
service.

So
when
time
came
for
new
tires
for
my
Honda
Odyssey,
I
called
my
local
Town
Fair
Tire
(Woburn,
MA)
to
see
if
they
had
4
Michelin
tires
in
stock
for
my
Honda
Odyssey.

I
spoke
with
Tyler
(clerk#
392M)
who
was
very
well
mannered
and
extremely
knowledgeable.

He
informed
me
the
tires
I
wanted
were
not
currently
in
stock,
but
would
be
available
the
next
day
if
I
wanted
to
wait.

He
quoted
me
a
price
and
we
booked
the
appointment
for
the
following
day.

I
arrived
the
following
day
to
have
the
tires
installed
along
with
a
4
wheel
alignment.

At
the
same
time,
I
informed
Tyler

that
NTB
had
the
same
tire
for
roughly
$40
a
tire
cheaper
and
also
included
free
mounting
and
balancing,
valve
stems,
flat
repair,
tire
rotation,
etc.

Tyler
understood
my
concerns
and
worked
up
a
contract
with
competitive
pricing
to
the
NTB
quote.

The
savings
wasn't
dramatic
($2.00
per
wheel),
but
the
fact
that
he
was
willing
to
work
with
me
was
greatly
appreciated.


Currently
waiting
for
the
tires
to
be
installed
and
wanted
to
pass
along
thanks
to
Tyler
and
the
folks
at
Town
Fair
Tire
for
a
great
first
experience.
Great
job.
No
problems
at
all
getting
what
I
expected.
Ordered

items

Really

Many
thanks.
I
find
TripAdvisor
to
be
a
very
accurate
source
of
information
concerning
lodging,
shopping
and
dining
options
world-wide.

Its
information,
provided
by
a
corps
of
actual
travelers/diners
provides
a
real
time
picture
of
individual
hotels,
shops
and
restaurants,

It
has
helped
my
wife
and
I
discover
hidden
gems
in
large
cities
and
small
hamlets
world-wide.
These
guys
were
spot
on!
Any
thing
you
need
they
got
it
and
it's
nice
products
plus
speedy
delivery!
Would
recommend
to
any
one.
I'll
be
doing
more
business
here.
I
realised
after
ending
up
with
a
flat
late
one
murky
Friday
night
that
I
would
need
to
change
my
tyres
as
they
were
all
in
more
or
less
the
same
poor
condition.
The
thought
of
buying
4
new
tyres
filled
my
bank
balance
with
dread
so
I
thought
I
would
have
a
quick
look
online
first.
I
came
across
Tyre
Shopper,
who
seemed
very
reasonably
priced
and
had
a
well
laid
out,
easy
to
navigate
website.
The
fact
that
the
quoted
price
included
fitting
made
costing
an
awful
lot
easier
too.
I
decided
on
a
quality
budget
tyre
which
was
discounted
and
also
came
highly
recommended
by
Auto
Express.
The
payment
process
was
as
painless
as
can
be
expected,
and
I
received
a
prompt
email
letting
me
know
the
wheres
and
whens.
The
next
day
I
received
a
call
from
one
of
the
Tyre
Shopper
team
explaining
that
the
tyres
I
had
ordered
were
no
longer
in
stock
(probably
my
only
gripe,
as
they
were
shown
on
the
website
as
being
in
stock),
and
was
offered
a
higher
quality
tyre
for
the
same
price.
I
duly
accepted,
and
the
following
morning
they
were
fitted
at
my
local
National
auto
centre
in
around
20
minutes.
Really
good
service,
and
I'm
very
happy
with
the
tyres
as
they
are
about
as
eco-friendly
as
tyres
get,
and
I
now
feel
much
safer
on
the
road.
I
wouldn't
hesitate
to
recommend
Tyre
Shopper,
they
provided
me
with
a
no
hassle
service
at
a
very
good
price,
and
I'll
be
looking
to
them
for
my
next
set
which
hopefully
won't
be
for
quite
a
while
yet...
This
was
my
first
Baracuta
purchase
but
it
won't
be
my
last.
I
received
my
knitted
polo
top
quickly
and
was
impressed
with
the
weight
first
off
(
I
have
a
Penguin
long-sleeved
knitted
polo
shirt
and
it's
not
as
heavy
as
this
one),
and
on
close
inspection
found
it
was
finished
to
a
high
standard
too.
I
would
recommend
Baracuta
to
anyone
who
wants
to
look
and
feel
their
best
at
all
times!
Really
good
website
easy
to
use,
great
products
and
billiant
delivery
speed
Been
a
customer
for
many
years
now
and
always
a
great
service
and
support!
Good
price,
prompt
delivery
and
excellent
service.
Easy
to
order
online
after
initial
setup.
Refunded
for
shorter
fill
than
ordered.
Very
pleased.
Will
definitely
be
using
BoilerJuice
again.
The
combination
of
jAlbum
&
Turtle
skin
served
us
well
for
organizing
photos
and
videos
into
one
album.

We
plan
to
use
it
from
now
on
for
all
our
photo/video
album
projects.

Thank
you
for
a
good
product!
I
keep
going
back
to
cultpens
-
their
selection,
service
and
reliability
is
faultless,
and
so
far
consistently
superior
to
any
competing
sites
I
occasionally
try.
I'd
highly
recommend
them,
even
when
only
placing
small
orders
their
service
has
always
been
great.
This
is
the
best
site
to
buy
suplements!
Good
prices!
I
ordered
some
items
from
Maxpedition
at
Heinnies.
All
items
were
exactly
as
described.
Also
the
people
at
Heinnie
kept
me
informed
at
every
step
and
were
always
ready
with
information
when
asked.
I
found
the
website
friendly
and
easy
to
navigate.
I
selected
the
item
I
required
(set
of
seals
for
electric
shower)
and
within
48
hours
the
item
arrived
well
packaged
and
exactly
as
described.
You
can't

than
this

After
having
tried
for
two
times
for
my
requested
refund,
I
still
couldn’t
get
a
clear
answer.
That’s
ASOS
for
you!
My
order
for
a
few
shorts
and
tees
were
so
poorly
met,
I
wondered
on
what
makes
them
a
name
in
business.
For
those
who
are
looking
to
shop
better,
I
guess
FSession
is
actually
a
better
choice.
Although
they
are
just
about
five
years
old,
I
loved
the
quick
shipping
and
packaging,
plus
no
complaints
for
the
products
sent!
Honestly,
I
shopped
so
much
on
ASOS
that
I
am
surprised
at
their
poor
services.
It’s
FSession
for
me
all
the
way!

I
had
a
little
snag
with
my
initial
order,
having
only
received
the
products
I
bought
as
secondary
items.

The
main
thing
I
needed
was
shaving
cream
which
was
included
on
the
invoice
but
not
in
the
packaging.

I
called
up

service
and
without
fuss
was
mailed
the
cream.

The
products
are
awesome,
I
would
recommend
the
all
inclusive
razor
blade
bundle
for
new
shavers
to
find
the
right
blade
for
them.

The
cream
I
got
was

while
a

at

I
have
since

to
enjoy
the
scent,

from

in

I

today
my
order.

find

can
not
go
wrong
ordering
from

A
truly
five
star

Was
ordered
in
the
morning
and
delivered
same
day.
We
were
very
happy
with
the
service
we
got
from
stress
free

were
on
time
polite
and
a
credit
to
their
profession,we
will
not
travel
again
without
using
them.
It
is
a
good
product
and
i
think
that
to
a
normal
person
it
would
keep
them
sweat
free
for
the
day,
but
for
me
it
seems
that
i
could
still
feel
it
come
through
and
if
i
was
wearing
a
tight
top
that
is
a
light
colour
then
i
dont
think
that
it
would
stop
the
sweat
marks
for
me.
I
have
quite
large
shoulders
and
big
armpits
so
i
do
get
hot
very
quickly
and
i
seem
to
sweat
throughout
the
day
at
the
office
and
not
in
short
periods,
i
think
this
product
would
be
fine
but
my
issue
is
a
bit
more
potent
than
this
top
can
solve
so
im
gonna
try
and
combine
some
products
and
hope
for
the
best!
Good

Prior

Parts
Geek,
I
was
at
the

of

and
the

stores
don't

parts
for
SAAB.

Parts
geek
has
been
a
real
life
saver.

The
cost
savings
have
been
incredible,
and
I
no
longer
need
to
browse
the
Internet
at
large
looking
for
the
right
parts.

I
am
happy
to
have
a
single
OEM
parts
source
for
my
SAAB
and
Honda.
people
that
I
dealt
with
Mike
and
Jay
were
great.
they
have
great
customer
service
skills
The
reason
why
I
say
that
is
because
it
seems
they
made
everybody
feel
comfortable

in
the
waiting
room

always
updating
everyone

on
the
progress

of
there
car.


I
just
came
in
for
a
inspection
and
oil

I
will
definitely
bring
my
car
back
to
Jay
and
Mike
again

even
feel
comfortable

my

there
thanks

The
prices
are
really
competitive.

The
online
videos
mean
that
it
is
as
good
as
going
to
the
shop.

Next
day
delivery
and
taking
the
old
appliance
away
are
costed
at
bargain
prices.

Your
councill
will
charge
you
3
to
4
times
as
much
for
removal
I
buy
with
great
confidence
because
in
the
past
the
service
was
excellent
Quick
and
fairly
priced.
I
was
disappointed
in
how
long
it
took
to
receive
the
part
I
ordered.

When
I
received
the
part,
the
part
numbers
didn't
match
and
I
looked
it
up
on
another
website
("Rock
Auto")
and
it
showed
that
the
part
had
a
motor
on
(the
window
regulator)
compared
to
the
one
I
received
("which
didn't
have
a
motor
on
it",
it
was
drilled
out
and
the
wrapping
that
it
came
in
was
ripped
open,
like
it
had
sent
out
and
sent
back
to
you)
but
my
customer
wanted
to
keep
it
and
use
the
motor
off
it
his
old
broken
one!..By
luck
the
motor
was
still
good?
Normally,
the
place
which
I
deal
with
delivers
parts
within
2
to
3
days
and
5
days
at
least
by
ground.

Compared
to
your
system.

So
overall,
I
was
dissatisfied
and
will
go
back
to
buying
from
"Rock
Auto."
I
have
ordered
from
multiple
online
sites
and
only
supplementwarehouse.com
has
provided
the
best
deals
and
free
merchandise.
Not
to
mention
the
wide
range
of
product
is
outstanding.
The
security
of
purchasing
is
fantastic
as
well.
Overall
five
out
of
five!
We
have
used
Newark
Long
term
Parking
twice
and
have
been
very
satisfied
with
their
service.

This
first
time
we
came
back
from
vacation
and
our
battery
was
dead.

They
immediately
came
to
the
car
and
charged
the
battery
for
a
small
fee.


They
are
very
courteous.
AMAZING
VALUE
OVER
50%
CHEAPER
THAN
MY
VETS!!
I
HAVE
NOW
USED
GLOBAL
WEB
PAY
5
TIMES
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS.
One
month
to
these
days
from
when
I
ordered
my
glasses.
I
ordered
a
pair
of
Woodies
and
a
pair
of
Bulettis.
The
prescription
is
perfect.
The
quality
is
good.
And
I
paid
less
than
$200
for
both
pair.
Nice
guys,
nice
atmosphere.
The
part
I
received
was
not
correct
but
worked
it
out
with
customer
service
for
a
return
so
I
give
them
credit
for
that.
Great
alternative
to
Steam
if
you
need
a
quick
key!
The
activation
code
e-mail
was
sent
immediately
after
purchasing.
I
recently
received
my
order
for
two
pairs
of
distance
specs
and
I
am
very
happy
with
both
pairs.

The
service
is
quick
and
so
easy
to
use.

If
you've
never
ordered
online
glasses
before
I
strongly
recommend
this
company.

Oh,
did
I
mention
the
price?

Both
pairs
were
in
the
cut
price
sale
and,
including
postage
to
Spain,
they
were
less
than
25
euros!

Fantastic!
Excellent
service.
Good
quality
but
expensive
Great
price
and
very
well
done.
Seems
to
have
good
reception
and
works
as
promised.
I
have
never
bought
this
kind
of
items
before,
the
service
was
fast
and
painless.
My
part
was
easy
to
order
and
handled
in
an
accurate
and
timely
manner.
When
you
calling
the
sales
line,
it
really
depends
your
luck
of
the
day.
You
might
get
very
friendly
associates
that
are
extremely
knowledgeable
on
products,
or
you
might
get
others
that
are
rude
and
know
nothing
but
entering
keys.
Having
a
brand
like
B&H,
this
is
pretty
disappointing.
BUDDY

COMPANY

Really
great
prices
on
supplements,
especially
compared
to
GNC
and
other
big
named
places.
The
only
complaint
is
how
expensive
the
shipping
is,
though
they
can't
do
anything
about
that.
The
food
is
terrific,
the
shipping
and
service
are
superb,
what
more
can
I
say?

poorly

did
not
forcing
me
to
find
them
locally
before
I
can
do
the

Not
very
happy
about
that.
I
wasn't
sure
if
I
would
want
to
order
my

online.

however,
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
VetRxDirect
.
Good
prices
and
good

Great
Job!!

Received
the
correct

in
a

and
in

Amazing

The
one
thing
that
kept

from

is
shipping

You
have
to
make
sure
all

from

or
you
need

It
was
with
trepidation
that
we
booked
and
paid
for
our
car
with
this
company!
IT
seemed
too
good
to
be
true.
We
read
the
reviews
by
others
on
tripadvisor
and
it
seemed
there
were
a
few
problems.,
I
called
the
office
in
Sydney
and
very
bluntly
asked
"why
it
was
so
cheap"
the
girl
was
lovely
and
explained
the
cars
were
two
years
old
and
under
a
bulk
contract
to
Australians!
As
it
included
ALL
costs
and
there
were
to
be
no
extra
surprises
when
we
arrived
we
went
ahead.
We
had
a
little
fear
after
we
booked
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
take
the
car
into
Canada
but
after
a
phone
call
that
seemed
to
be
no
problem
either!
We
have
rented
cars
in
USA
previously
and
while
they
seem
cheap
online
it
is
when
you
pick
the
car
up
that
the
extra
deductibles
and
waivers
are
added.
sometimes
it
is
$1000

B&H

terrific
place
to

is
a
breeze.

This
is
my
second

shopping
at

and
it
won't
be
my
last.

Great
job!
Overall
I
had
a
wonderful
experience
with
the
company.
My
one
complaint
would
be
Monday
I
called
in
to
ask
when
I
would
receive
my
tracking
information
and
the
lady
that
answered
the
phone
could
not
hear
me
and
said
"I
can't
hear
you"
and
just
hung
up.
She
didn't
wait
to
see
if
maybe
the
connection
would
get
better
or
even
make
a
second
attempt.
I
was
just
abruptly
hung
up
on.
I
then
had
to
call
back
and
go
threw
the
entire
automated
system
again.
It
was
extremely
rude
and
very
frustrating.

of

and

The
company
(also

held
my

for
2
months
without
sending
me
any

The

I
think
was
out

I

I
called
for
a
refund
and
I
was
refunded.

I
then
ordered
the

from

received
the

promptly
and
never
ordered
from
anyone
else
since.

would
recommed
this
company
The
one
concern
I
had
with
this
company
was
that
they
had
ridiculous
shipping
costs.
But
when
I
looked
at
all
of
the
factors
I
realized
shipping
will
always
cost
money.
The
amazing
prices
for
shaker
bottles
and
samples
along
with
their
ridiculously
low
prices
on
supplements
made
it
all
worth
it.
I
am
happy
to
be
your
new
customer
:)
This
is
a
great
place
to
shop!

I
will
be
back!!
Supplement
Warehouse.com
provided
the
absolute
best
prices.
I
thoroughly
scour
the
internet
and
local
shops
for
best
prices
and
supplementwarehouse.com
has
proven
to
be
the
leader
in
lowest
prices.
They
also
got
my
order
to
me
in
the
blink
of
an
eye!
Thanks
SupplementWarehouse.com
for
serving
all
my
supplement
needs!

After
my
dad
took
a
fall
in
the
shower,
we
weren't
sure
what
we
needed
to
do
in
order
to
make
sure
it
didn't
happen
again.
After
learning
about
medical
alerts

and
a
little
bit
about
what
they
are,
we
were
still
confused.
I
was
looking
for
a
place
to
buy
cat
food
at
a
reasonable
price
and
I
found
it
on
PetFlow.com.
You
can
set
up
automatic

and
the
prices
are
like
a
third
of
what
you
would
pay
on

sites.
Very
impressed
at
how
fast
I
received
my
shipment.
It
only
took
2
days.
I've
bought
a
number
of
things
from
B&H.
Never
had
any
problems.
Once,
when
I
made
a
mistake
in
ordering,
they
were
very
helpful
and
friendly
in
getting
the
mistake
resolved.
They
had
what
I
needed
and
got
it
to
me
quickly.
I
would
definitely
order
from
this
company
again.
Excellent
transaction
Pcgamesupply
is
a
great
way
to
get
game
cash
immediately.

A
little
laggy,

but
it's
not
enough
to
be
a
significant
problem.
If
your
trying
to
become
a
better
you,
running
at
full
capacity
and
feeling
great
this
website
has
so
many
different
items
that
will
do
the
trick.
I
have
felt
a
noticeable
difference
in
dealing
with
stress,
memory,
stamina
and
focus
with
their
Alpha
Brain,
New
Mood
and
Shroom
Tech.

The
Hemp
Force
has
worked
great
and
is
the
best
tasting
protein

I
have
ever
had.
The
list
goes
on
and
on,
I
wont
go
to
any
other
company
for
supplements,
nutrition's
foods
and
work
out

The
leather
wall
ball
is
an
amazing
work
out.
This
is
my
sixth

from
yesstyle
and
I
have
always
been
satisfied
with
the
quality
of
the
products.

and
it

as
much
as
I

I'll
recommend
them
to
others,
and
surely
use
them
again
in
the
future.

molto
contento
.
venditore
affidabilissimo.
I
am
pleased
with
all
aspects
of
this
recent
transaction.
Their
site
was
easy
to
navigate
and
the
parts
I
needed
were
priced
competitively.
Processing
and
delivery
were
quick
and
email
notification
kept
me
informed
of
progress.
The
part
I
ordered
was
well
packaged,
and
free
from
blemish.
Overall
very
pleased.
Our
tech
is
great.

He
took
the
time
explain
everything
to
us.

He
was
very
patient
with
us
and
explain
the
various
option
available.
After
I
asked
which
part
I
needed
for
my
Audi,
I
got
the
right
fit
for
the
car
and
received
it
promptly
to
my
door.

Great
service
at
the
right
price.
I
would
recommend
Tyre
Shopper
for
price
and
excellent
service.
Will
definitely
be
using
them
again.
I
recently
received
a
shaving
kit
(brush,
pre
and
post
shaving
lotions
and
shaving
cream)
and
found
the
experience
awesome!
I
was
using
a
Mach
3
cartridge
and
constantly
struggled
with
razor
burn.
I
researched
thr
crap
out
of
safty
razors
and
settled
on
the
Merkur
23c.
Wow
what
a
shave!
Easy!
Picked
up
a
multi
pack
of
razors
and
am
trying
them
all.
There
are
tons
of
how
to
vids
on
shaving
with
it,
different
brand
razor
and
how
to
use
a
shaving
cream.
It
is
easily
my
favorite
part
of
the
day.
I'm
so
glad
this
is
getting
more
popular
and
there
is
plenty
of
variety
out
there
for
brands,
scents
and
methods.
I
have
never
had
a
problem
with
Delivery.com.
In
my
neighborhood,
delivery
service
is
key
and
I
love
how
convenient
and
easy
they've
made
the
ordering
process.
Highly
recommended.
Very
easy
to
book,
get
the
car
and
return
the
car.

Highly
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
looking
to
rent
a
car
in
Europe.
l

to
all

family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I
ordered
a
Toto
toilet
for
a
bathroom
remodel.
The
size
tank
I
ordered
was
temporarily
out
of
stock.
I
called
customer
service
to
check
on
the
delivery
date
and
was
suggested
a
smaller
tank
that
was
currently
in
stock.
As
yet,
it
hasn't
been
installed,
but
I
believe
it
will
be
what
I
wanted.
A
good
choice
of
items
all
despatched
quickly
and
at
a
good
price.
I
was
struggling
to
find
a
loan.
I
tried
wageme.com
like
everyother
lender
and
when
i
spoke
to
them
on
the
phone
they
were
very
helpful
and
after
a
few
questions
they
approved
my
loan.
Great
service
and
fast

thank
you

I
always
find
the
process
of
ordering
with
Comms
Express
to
be
a
pleasant
and
easy
process,
the

always
on
time
and
goods
are
well

I
was
looking
for
a
car
parking
space
at
Manchester
airport
a
few
weeks
earlier
and
found
that
now
(as
usual)
the
price
has
gone
up
from
£19
to
£25
just
because
I've
left
it
another
week.
It's
not
a
lot
of
money
but
still
frustrating
to
say
the
least.
After
spending
too
much
time
searching
for
flights
I
tried
kayak.
Seemed
to
work
great
until
I
tried
Expedia!
I
will
never
go
back,
Expedia
is
my
go
to
for
all
my
travel
needs,
business
or
personal!
My
experence
in
ordering
glasses
on
line
was
unknown
because
i've
never
done
it
before.

I
spent
over
$400.00
on
them
and
could
only
hope
they
were
done
correctly.
But
my
glasses
were
great
i
dont
know
how
they
got
it
right
but
they
did.
They
were
friendly
and
helpful
i
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
even
my
wife.
I
ordererd
some
computer
spares,
only
small
items
and
they
were
out
of
stock
at
the
time
of
ordering.
I
got
an
email
telling
me
so
and
an
approximate
delivery
date.After
a
week
or
so
another
email
giving
the
exact
date
of
delivery
and
sure
enough
it
came
spot
on
the
date.
I

Great

We've

these
are
the
best.
Best

PERIOD!!

Everybody
say
BB.com
has
the
best
prices
but
that's
not
true.

Bought

containers
of

for
about
$35
cheaper

than
BB.com.

I
bought
a
ring
in
Oct
2011.
I
used
a
so-called
"personal
shopper"
at
Brilliance
to
select
my
diamond
and
ring.
While
I
didn't
find
the
personal
shopper
very
personable,
my
complaint
is
about
the
service
(or
lack
of
service
provided).
No
problems
arrived
in
perfect
condition
exactly
when
they
said
it
would
Brilliant
service,
all
items
arrived
on
time
and
intact,
and
i
was
kept
informed
every
step
of
the
way
Ordered
over
the
phone
-
Sales
very
professional
&
polite.
Can't
ask
for
anything
better.
Ordered,picked
up
delivered
and
returned
perfectly.
We
ordered
the
garage
door
opener
coupler
and
received
the
delivery
within
a
few
days.

Very
quick
delivery
and
the
prices
were
very
good.
My
doctor
recommended
that
I
continue
with
the
proscribed
vitamin
as
I
was
running
low...
so
I
ordered
two
more
bottles
and
they
arrived
before
I
used
up
the
current
bottle
and
there
were
no
shipping
costs...



I
leave
it
up
to
my
doctor
to
determine
whether
the
prescription
is
doing
what
it
is
proscribed
to
do.
I
received
a
call
that
service
was
to
be
performed
as
contracted.

I
acknowledge
receipt
of
the
notification
and
asked
in
my
replay
approximately
what
time
the
service
was
to
be
performed
because
I
wanted
to
inform
my
retired
neighbor
who
keeps
an
eye
on
the
house.

I
never
received
an
answer.

A
receipt
of
the
services
performed
was
left
behind.

I
checked
out
the
unit
but
I
could
not
tell
whether
the
service
was
performed
or
not.

Everything
looked
dry
and
clean;
I
couldn't
tell
whether
the
filter
was
changed
as
it
looked
just
like
the
one
that
had
been
on
the
engine.

If
all
was
done
according
to
the
contract,
the
service
staff
is
to
be
congratulated
on
a
job
well
done
as
everything
was
"clean
as
a
whistle"
just
as
it
has
been
all
along.

So,
it
is
not
with
criticism
that
I
say
I
cannot
tell
whether
service
was
done
or
not;
I
simply
could
not
tell
one
way
or
the
other....


that
is
why
I
gave
it
a
rating
of
3
stars..


otherwise,
I
would
have
given
the
service
five
stars,
if
I
could
tell
that
the
service
was
performed.

I
trust
if
was!
Bought
two
items.
They
were
cheaper
than
other
retailers
and
arrived
in
no
time.
Thankyou
Merlin
Great
just
great.
Puuuuuuutoooooosssssssss
Satisfied
with
the
transaction,
will
purchase
again.
Perfect
Place
to
Shop
No
fuss
in
ordering
an
very
quick
delivery.
Part
was
packaged
well
an
all
pieces
were
there.
I
was
very
satisfied
with
this
transaction.
Every
time
that
I
use
the
ebookers.ch
I
have
a
good
experience,
however
when
comes
to
more
complex
request
such
as
multicity
tickets
reservation
I
can
only
reserve
hotel
for
the
first
destination,
I
need
to
create
a
new
one
for
the
others.
The
books
are
fantastic.
The
customer
service
is
great.
However,
the
software
to
make
the
books
for
mac
could
be
so
much
better.
I
actually
kinda
dread
making
the
books.
Integration
with
Adobe
Lightroom
looks
really
nice,
but
I
do
not
own
Lightroom.
Also,
I
can't
believe
their
is
no
support
for
Aperture
photos
(the
photos
only
come
in
at
the
preview
resolution
rather
than
full
resolution).
I
love
Blurb,
but
I
feel
like
they
are
making
it
hard
for
me
to
give
them
my
money.
You
will
never
find
cheaper
products
anywhere
else
(and
if
you
do,
they'll
top
it)!

On
top
of
that,
they
have
everything
that
one
could
want
for
their
health/supplement
needs!

I
LOVE
SUPPLEMENTWAREHOUSE.COM!
Great
prices
and
selection.
I
am
a
very
satisfied
and
a
repeat
customer.
Placed
my

What

anyone
ask

Would

anyone.
Faster
than
expect

Received
the
correct
part.
I
would
definitely
order
again.

My
first
order
of
a
dip
stick
for
my
Volvo
was
shipped
quickly,
was
the
right
part
and
the
price
was
one
half
of
the
ther
suppliers
I
found.
Can't
beat
the
price
match
guarantee.
They
also
throw
in
a
lot
of
free
goodies
with
your
order.
All
went
well
Ordered
a
back-up
light
switch
for
my
2003
Nissan
Frontier.
The
website
assured
me
it
was
the
correct
part.
It
didn't
fit.
Just
going
to
order
one
through
the
dealer.
I
had
a
storage
unit
researched
and
reservred
in
minutes
...
if
that.
It's
been
the
easiest
part
of
this
move
thus
far.
I
needed
both
mirrors
for
a
2002
Suburban
(heated
&
lights).
PartsGeek
had
them
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
the
dealership
wanted.
I
placed
my
order
with
PartsGeek
and
had
them
in
hand
within
4
days.
They
arrived
complete
&
in
perfect
condition
thanks
to
the
protective
wrapping
someone
took
the
time
to
do
properly.
To
my
delight,
they
even
included
an
extra
set
of
nuts
in
case
you
happen
to
drop
one
down
the
door
panel
-
like
I
did.
Navigating
their
site
to
find
the
proper
mirrors
was
simple
&
straight
forward.
I
will
be
using
PartsGeek
whenever
possible
for
all
of
my
vehicles
&
would
highly
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
parts!
Had
an
emergency
because
of
a
tire
puncture.

Saw
me
within
30
minutes.

Done
in
an
hour.

Checked
and
found
out
tire
was
still
under
warranty.

Always
go
there
for
tires.
Happy
with
the
price
I
got
for
my
phone
and
payment
options.
The
postal
envelope
was
very
slow
to
arrive,
which
caused
some
delay
in
my
ability
to
post
my
old
phone
to
you.
The
time
it
took
to
find
the
tyres
I
wanted,
find
a
local
fitting
station
and
pay
on
line
was
so
much
quicker
than
phone
calls
and
the
price
was
lowest
of
all
the
comparisons
with
others.

core
return
but
other
than
that
I
guess
it
was
ok.
But
it
would

been
nice
to

in

REAL
EASY
TO
USE
AND
PROVIDES
THE
MOST
INFORMATION
ABOUT
RATES,
SIZES,
AND
DETAILS
OF
THE
FACILITY.
BY
FAR
THE
BEST
SITE
I
HAVE
EVER
USED
TO
SEARCH
FOR
STORAGE
UNITS.
Overall
a
great
service,
prompt
delivery,
easy
to
use
website
and
good
prices.
Once
an
order
has
been
placed,
communication
on
the
state
of
the
order
is
also
helpful.
I
also
like
the
discount
incentives
from
time
to
time.
If
they
keep
this
up,
I'll
keep
being
one
of
their
customers.
So
far,
so
good.

up
team
thankyou
I
would
absolutely
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
who
has
irs
debt.
I
felt
like
I
was
taken
care
of
with
very
fair
results
and
because
of
this
I
now
can
have
a
better
life
with
less
stress.
I
was
given
in
my
opinion
an
awesome
person
to
deal
with
my
case
she
was
so
friendly
and
walked
me
through
it
all.
Purchased
a
Stans
NoTubes
conversion
kit
-
Merlin
Cycles
had
the
best
price.
I
bought
this
summer
house
because
of
the
design,
however,
the
build
quality
is
barely
acceptable.
Their
order
to
delivery
performance
is
woeful.
They
asked
me
for
their
feedback
prior
to
delivering
the
product,
though
they
took
the
full
amount
(including
fitting)
at
the
time
of
placing
the
order.
The
customer
service
was
at
best
appalling,
I
was
kept
hanging
on
the
telephone
for
over
an
hour
on
three
separate
calls.
he
delivery/fitting

team
stated
what
day
they
were
coming
between
7am
and
7pm
and
were
supposed
to
call
to
give
some
idea
of
their
pending
arrival.
predictably
there
was
no
call.
The
fitting
team
were
the
BEST
PART
of
the
company
through
judging
by
the
calls
the
senior
man
took
they
were
always
up
against
it.
In
summary
a
company
that
could
be
very
good
but
very
badly
managed.
MD
take
note.
I
bought
a
Drover
Barbour
Jacket
and
being
a
large
bloke
I
ordered
the
largest
size
as
I
want
to
wear
a
fleece
under
it.
However,
it
was
too
big
so
I
returned
it
and
within
a
couple
of
days
I
got
a
perfect
replacement,
no
fuss,
no
hassle
=
a
great
company
to
deal
My
builders
fitted
the
system
with
absolute
ease.
I
had
put
underfloor
heating
in
my
last
house
and
found
it
to
be
really
comfortable.
So
I
didn't
need
persuading
to
have
it
in
this
house.
It
warms
up
pretty
quickly
and
stays
warm
for
hours
,
we
have
put
it
in
a
new
extension
of
open
plan
sitting
room,
breakfast
area,
kitchen
and
utility.
We
also
put
in
a
small
wood
burner
in
the
sitting
room
area
and
between
the
two
systems
have
a
lovely
cosy
environment.
By
putting
the
underfloor
on
for
2
hours
at
tea
time
it
stay
warm
and
cosy
all
evening
and
is
still
comfortable
the
following
morning!!
I
was
satisfied
with
the
description
of
the
hood
hinges,
the
price
of
the
product,
shipping
charges
and
delivery
time.
I
will
recommend
you
and
place
another
order
pretty
soon.
I
was
a
little
troubled
about
after
market
ink
cartridge
let
alone
buy
them
online,
but
the
price
was
too
good
to
pass
up
plus
they
had
a
special
on
that
week.

I
received
two
black
XLs
and
the
other
color
XL
for
over
half
the
price
at
a
local
big
box
THE
CAR
WE
RENTED
WAS
A
SKODA
WHICH
REALLY
SURPRISED
ME.

THE
CAR
EXCEEDED
OUR
EXPECTATIONS
AND
WE
WERE
PLEASED.

THE
ONLY
CRITICISM
I
HAD
ON
THE
RENTAL
WAS
THE
ADDRESS
ON
THE
PICKUP
IN
WOLVERHAMPTON
WAS
INACCURATE.
Recommended
would
certainly
continue
to
shop
there!
Ship
sticks
did
an
excellent
job
in
shipping
my
clubs
to
Florida!
They
picked
them
up
at
my
home
in
Omaha,
and
delivered
them
to
my
home
in
Florida
in
a
timely
manner.
Have
recommended
Shipsticks
to
all
my
friends
who
have
needed
golf
clubs

Ordered
a
set
of
shelves
&
hammer.

Delivery
arrived
next
day
as
promised.

Hammer
missing,
but
replacement
sent
immediately.
Excellent
price
on
memory
cards
&
USB
sticks.
This
was
a
simple
transaction
to
arrange.
The
product
was
as
stated
and
the
delivery
arrived
when
the
seller
said
it
would.
Will
not
hesitate
to
buy
further
items
when
required.
Just
the
job
quick
and
painless
,would
recomend
to
anyone.The
local
garage
Failee
Services
are
very
trustwothy
and
do
a
bang
up
job.
So
yeah,
I
ordered
the
new
board
around
mid-day,
chose
the
2-3
days
option
and
it
arrived
the
very
next
morning.
Excellent
packaging
,
very
reasonable
price,
and
my
TV
works
like
a
charm
again.
Most
definitely
recommended
The
whole
ordering
process
was
simple
and
upfront.
The
best
part
though
was
being
told
the
courier
service
they
use.
So
I
had
a
tracking
number
supplied,
but
never
needed
to
use
it
as
I
had
supplied
my
mobile
number.
I
recieved
a
txt
message
the
night
before
telling
me
to
expect
the
goods
the
next
day,
then
another
txt
message
that
morning
telling
me
what
time
(to
within
an
hour)
the
item
would
arrive.
All
in
all,
very
smooth
and
very
speedy.
I
bought
some
Zebra
pens
as
Christmas
stocking
fillers.
The
pens
are
a
pen/pencil
combination
-
twist
the
barrel
to
get
red
or
black
pens
or
a
pencil.
The
pens
look
and
feel
very
good
and
were
an
absolute
bargain
at
the
discounted
price.
Delivery
time
was
also
very
impresive
-
the
pens
arrived
within
two
days
of
my
order.
I
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase.
Lowest
price
on
internet,
free
shipping
and
very
informative
delivery
service!
Fantastic
thank
you.
Ordered
at
2pm
on
Wednesday
&
it
was
at
my
door
Thursday
morning!
Also
prices
and
availability
are
second
to
none.
I
recommend
Merlin
to
all
my
cycling
friends.
Our
friends
in
Bristol
loved
the
flowers
and
chocolates
we
sent,
in
honor
of
their
anniversary.

The
flower
arrangement
was
even
more
beautiful
than
the
photo
we
looked
at
online.

They
sent
us
a
photo
of
the
flowers
via
e-mail.

Thank
you!

Thank
you!
Excellent
service
at
every
step
of
the
process.

Kept
me
informed
via
email,
letting
me
know
when
each
step
was
complete...no
guess
work
involved.

James
did
an
excellent
job.

Many
Thanks.
B&H
has
been
a
great
merchant
from
the
time
I
began
buying
from
them
around
2005.
Great
prices,
service
and
fast
reasonably
priced
shipping.
Online
it
stated
that
you
could
pick
your
contract
start
date
and
they
would
hold
the
unit
for
you.
I
wanted
to
start
2
1/2
weeks
from
now,
but
as
soonas
I
reserved
it,
they
called
and
said
it
was
first
come
first
served...and
that
if
anyone
came
and
wanted
the
unti
they
would
give
it
to
them
unless
I
paid
for
the
partial
month
rent.
I
ordered
a
part
for
my

You
sent
me
the

I
was
able
to
get

number
however
there
are
issues
regarding
shipping
costs,
getting
the
right
product
etc.
I
have
not
been
able
to
get
this
resolved.
It
would
be
nice
if
there
was
a
number
so
I
could
TALK
to
someone.
A
nice
experience.

Even
when
I
have
asked
for

they
have
never
failed

It
is
great
to
be

this
and
I
will
continue
to
purchase
from
them
in

I

and
they

of
lookie-loos
later
POP
helped
the
right
buyer
find
the

and
then
they
reeled
in
the
deal
that
probably
wouldn't
have
happened
without
their
assistance
and
vast
experience.

POP's
staff
communicated
every
step
in
the
overall
transaction
clearly
and
professionally
while
keeping
both
parties
on
schedule.

I'm
glade

didn't
try

this
sale

Initially,
I
was
pleased
with
the
quotation
I
received
from
Annualtravelinsurance.
I
signed
up
straight
away
because
the
quote
was
so
competitive.
Unfortunately,
having
signed
up,
I
discovered
that
the
declaration
of
existing
medical
conditions
added
a
substantial
amount
to
the
original
quotation
which
made
it
uncompetituve.
The
Company
was
very
good
and
refunded
the
sign-up
fee
immediately.
I
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
completion
of
a
medical
history
questionnaire
should
be
undertaken
prior
to
sign-up,
though
the

does

will
be

My
wife's
2007
Ford
Focus
had
some
sidewall
bubbling
on
a
snow
tire.

A
match
could
not
be
found
in
any
of
their
warehouses.

After
some
discussion,
I
had
a
set
of
AS
tires
mounted
to
run
until
late
fall
when
the
replacement
snow
should
again
be
available.

During
the
changeover,
two
of
the
chrome
caps
on
the
lug
nuts
fell
victim
to
the
airgun.

The
store
replaced
them
without
hesitation
or
question.

All
of
my
questions
were
answered
in
a
thoughtful
and
informed
fashion.

The
damaged
tire
was
credited
towards
the
AS
tires
purchased
with
no
hesitation
or
problem.

Service
was
fast
and
staff
helpful.

No
complaints.

two

Needless

Once
I
past

I
frantically
started

I
was
pleasantly

with
the
professional

I
received
from

They
continually
kept

throughout

clearly

at

B&H
always

at

For
the
rare
occasion
it
doesn't
have

ask
yourself
this:
Is
it

I

not.

I

with
the

wouldn't

I
flagged
the

in
my

warn
others
whilst
being

Ebay
unilaterally
removed
the
poor

at
the
request
of
the
seller
to
protect
their
reputation,
but
did
so
without
any

to

I
was
left
on

and
Ebay
refused
to

The
prices
are
great
(you
can
find
the
same
mask
as
I
bought
on
Amazon
for
£15
more)
and
the
quality
of
products
is
always
high.
Shipping
was
very
quick
and
the
items
arrived
adequately
packaged.
Escapade
is
now
the
first
place
I
look
when
I
need
a

I'll
definitely
but
from
them
again.
Multiple
items
delivered
quickly
and

I
got

updated
at

stage
so
nothing
to
complain

Awesome
website
.
Easy
to
order
parts
from
and
got
just
what
I
needed.

Will
use
them
again
when
I
need
more
parts.
Easy,
Fast,
Perfect.
What
more
could
you
ask
for?
The
booking
was
easy
and
the
guy
that
turned
up
was
very
helpful.
If
the
service
was
cheaper
I
would
be
happier.
I
have
been
ordering
with
PartsGeek
for
about
a
year
now
since
I
got
my
car
and
what
a
joy
it
is
to
have
them.

Their
prices
are
the
cheapest
around
and
are
actually
good.

Most
aren't
OEM
parts
but
good
aftermarket
ones.

Shipping
is
usually
orderly
and
on
time.

Love
them!
On
their
website
I
was
easily
able
to
find
the
part,
confirm
it
was
a
genuine
spare
&
compatible,
view
&
download

showing
how
to

it.
Gave
me
confidence
I
could
fit
it
myself.

the
next

option
and
it
arrived
next

All
at

value,
less

wanted!
They
were
very
quick

there
was
a

variety
of
choices,
the
site
was
easy
to
use
and
all
at
very
good
value.
The
intro
pretty
much
says
it
all.
Quality
products,
amazing
variety,
secure
and
honest
dealings.
Have
been
using
them
for
well
over
ten
years,
with
no
regrets.
Using
the
website
to
design
my

was
quick
and
easy.

It
is
just
what
I
wanted.

The

were
easy
to
follow
and
it
was
really
flexible
with
the
design
too.

Thanks.

The
only

we

to
go
over
cleanliness
protocol

employee
involvement

don't

think

should
approach
female
guests
of
the

that
could
lead
to

if
the

weren't

I
was
extremely
happy
and
surprised
to
receive
the
goods
on
my
doorstep
within
48
hours
of
ordering.
Now
I
just
need
to
work
out
how
to
get
the
best
of
the
product.
The
fit
on
everything
is
perfect.
The
craftsmanship
of
the
stitching
is
beautiful.
Although
my

I
had
to

quite
some

for

everything

for
my
Brother's

main
thing.
Additionally,
my

loves
it!
Couldn't
be
happier
with
my
£6
glasses
-
they
are
as
good
as
my
£100+
designer
pair
from
the
opticians.

It
takes
a
couple
of
weeks
but
that
is
expected...

I
won't
ever
use
the
opticians
for
glasses
again!
On
the

of
a

about
the

on
the
Queen
Mary,
I
looked
up
the
Cunard

and
put
in
an
enquiry
about
the
cruise.

The
response
was
almost
immediate
and
an
offer
was
made
to
contact
me.

However
when
I
went
back
to
the
page,
there
was
a
48
hr
time
limit
to
book
and
pay.

I
did
this
immediately
and
was
able
to
get
the
cabin
level
that
we
asked
for.

I
found
the
whole
process
to
be
very
easy
and
the
response
very
fast.

We
are
looking
forward
to
the
cruise
now.

Bought

Ikon

that
on

from

enough
to

a

of

a

was
OK

I'd
rather
had

It's
a

once
the

they
contacted
me
promptly,
offered
to
come
a
day
earlier
and
the

was
punctual,
polite,
knowledgeable
and
very
helpful.

He
fixed
the

without
any

and
it
worked
for
three
more

before
I
had
to
call

back.
Often
Olotels
has
the
cheapest
price
on
comparison
sites
-
but
the
actual
price
they
display
for
your
purchase
will
vary
according
to
the
links
you
click
to
get
to
them.

Through
cashback
sites
like
Quidco,
for
example,
Olotels
will
automatically
inflate
the
price
of
the

so
you
pay
more
and
the
cashback
discount
is
effectively
worthless.

shipping
was
horrible.
Probably
not
much
fault
to
giftcards.com
but
more
with
the
USPS.
But
giftcards.com
should
know
what
(or
what
not)
the
USPS
can
do
and
act
accordingly.
After
a
slow
start
we
worked
our
way
around
the
photo
book
software
and
ended
up
with
a
high
quality
product
we
are
proud
to
show
our
friends
and
family,

we
will
be
using
jessops
again
for
our
next
photo
book
.
Apparently
the
fault
lies
with
Google
wallet,
so
I'm
not
sure
I
can
place
any
blame
on
Northshore,
but
I
placed
an
order,
and
then
went
two
weeks
without
hearing
anything.
I
assumed
the
package
had
been
sent,
but
finally
contacted
them
and
found
they
hadn't
even
received
my
order.
A
few
days
after
that,
the
package
was
sent,
and
I
received
it,
as
if
the
order
had
been
placed
2
weeks
after
it
was.
product
is
good
quality,
and
packaging
was
great.
Rock
bottom
prices;
tip-top
service.
Very
courteous
and
almost
immediate
dispatch.
What
more
can
I
add
to
the
above?
All
the
big
brands.
Almost
instant
dispatch.
Order:
St
John's
Wort.
Problem:
Anxiety
related
insomnia.
Service:
Pretty
much
instant.
Results:
In
all
honesty,
the
problem
has
worsened,
but
I've
only
been
taking
the
stuff
a
few
days!
St
Johns
Wort
can
take
up
to
six
weeks
to
take
full
effect.
If
anyone
claims
instant
results
it's
probably
just
the
placebo
effect.
You
can
save
a
fortune
by
purchasing
from
these
guys,
without
compromising
on
quality.
As
a
high
school
photography
teacher
running
an
analog
film
program
I
don't
even
bother
shopping
around.

B
and
H
has
everything,
it
has
the
best
price
and
the
shipping
gets
to
me
in
2
days
-
each
time,
every
time.

The
help
I
have
received
on
the
phone
over
the
years
has
proven
invaluable.

I
appreciate
this
company
and
intentionally
stay
loyal
to

We
were
very
happy
with
the
website
for
ease
of
ordering.
Like
many
data
recovery
services,
they
will
estimate
retrieval
costs
on
the
low
end
and
then
give
you
a
price
that
is
almost
twice
the
estimate
once
they
have
your
disc.
Hi
everybody,
The
payment
with
Bitcoin
is
very
easy
and
grateful
,
thanks
for
the
great
site.
Timely
and
correct
parts..satisfied
with
everything
except
the
part
was
not
the
color
I
was
led
to
believe
by
the
advertisement.
I
normally
wear
spectacles
with
Varifocal
lenses.
These
are
not
convenient
for
watching
TV
and
sport.
I
therefore
thought
that
I
would
purchase
a
pair
for
distance
only
and
to
get
them
from
SelectSpecs.com.
They
perform
well
and
look
good.
I'll
be
back.
I've
owned
6
Torchieres,
a
BlueMax
70W
desk
lamp
and
a
70W
BlueMax
floor
lamp.
I
purchased
a
V100
guitar.
Well
packed
and
no
issues.
The
courier
service
is
good.
Sent
flowers
&
teddy
to
our
daughter
who
was
having
her
baby
in
the
UAE.
Arrived
exactly
when
stated.
Thoroughly
recommend
this
service.
Very
pleased.
Cooker
was
damaged
on
delivery.
Replacement
also
damaged
and
had
to
wait
another
2
weeks
for
engineer
to
call
with
replacement
part.
Fast
shipping,
100%
Will
do
business
again!
We
arrived
at
approx
10
am
on
a
Sat
at
Prestwick
Scotland
airport.


We
had
pre
booked
and
pre
paid
for
a
full
size
Insignia
Wagon
3
weeks
prior
to
arriving.

Only
one
agent
was
on
duty
and
one
person
in
line
before
us.

When
she
was
finished
with
him
she
told
us
to
have
a
seat
as
there
was
other
work
she
had
to
complete.


We
waited
approx
30
mins
and
was
told
by
the
agent
she
only
had
a
VW
wagon
or
an
Insignia
sedan,
we
opted
for
the
sedan
as
it
was
larger.

The
veHicle
was
near
new
4,000
miles
and
well
cleaned
and
presented,
however,
it
was
not
the
one
we
had
reserved
for
4
adults
and
four
suitcases,
one
suitcase
had
to
be
placed
in
the
rear
seat
between
the
passengers.


I,m
not
sure
if
there
is
a
price
difference
between
the
wagon
and
sedan,
but
past
experience
shows
wagons
are
more
expensive
to
rent.

We
were
not
offered
any
return.


Overall
we
were
happy
with
the
car
and
service.
Highly
recommend,
great
prices
&
order
was
placed
&
received
within
24
hours.
I
am
so
happy
that
i
can
reach
My
friends
in
Kenya.
Chaplin
and
easy.
Have
already
recomeded
several
friends.
These
guys
got
it
right!
Great
service
and
fast
shipping
at
great
prices,
I
ordered
shocks
for
my
2007
Expedition
and
had
them
shipped
next
day
air,
got
them
as
promised
and
the
cost
to
ship
them
was
cheap!
I
will
order
more
parts
for
my
vehicles
from
PartsGeek
and
refer
them
to
others!
Keep
up
the
great
work!
Ok,
so
I
needed
an
outfit
for
a
wedding
and
I
had
three
days
in
which
to
find
it.
Having
lent
my
kilt
to
my
brother
for
the
afternoon
ceremony,
I
was
left
with
a
dilemma
-
what
can
I
wear.
So
I
wanted
to
restock
my
battery
supplies.
Have
been
more
than
happy
with
my
usual
supplier
-
Battery
Station
-
but
thought
I
would
check
out
the
opposition.
Great
quality
bed
and
headboard.
Slight
glitch
with
a
divan
drawer,
but
customer
service
was
fantastic!!
New
drawer
on
the
way
and
kept
informed
every
step
of
the
way.
So,
my
daughters
hair
straighteners
had
come
to
the
end
of
their
days.
A
cheaper
brand,
they
had
done
a
reasonable
job,
but
a
frustrated
daughter
had
had
enough.
I
said
to
her,
use
them
one
last
time
and
I'll
treat
you
to
a
new
pair!!
So
it
was
a
case
of
'hair
today,
gone
tomorrow'
!!
All
goods
arrived
promptly
and
as
ordered
have
just
bought
a
new
dino
pc
-for
about
40%
of
the
price
which
was
quoted
by
PC
World
etc
for
similar
spc
models.

the
pc
was
delivered
on
time
and
worked
straight
out
of
the
box
A
friend
told
me
about
the
site
so
I
gave
it
a
shot.
I
received
my
order
very
fast
however
I
did
not
receive
the
"free"
shaker
it
was
supposed
to
include.
I
really
don't
care
that
much
about
it
but
I
took
notice.
All
in
all
good
prices
for
supplements
and
a
fast
transaction.
I
like
the
taste
of
the
product.
The
case
is
a
little
big
for
home
use,
but
doable.
In
the
second
case
that
I
bought,
many
of
the
filter
packs
were
split
open
causing
a
mess,
were
unusable
and
thrown
away.
I
mentioned
this
in
the
comments
section
of
my
next
order.
No
response,
but
ok:
it
was
an
order
form
after
all.
When
I
received
the
friendly
"Thanks
for
your
order"
email,
I
replied
and
again
stated
the
problem
and
my
hope
for
a
better
experience
this
time;
Again,
no
response.
Good
service
but
all
business
and
not
a
local
hotel
employee
as
used
for
reservations
before.
The
Pignose
arrived
early
on
the
promised
day,
really
well
packaged
with
the
makers
box
and
the
Amp
in
perfect
condition.
I've
recently
purchased
the
chicken
breasts
and
can
not
fault
them,and
the
delivery
and
packaging
is
faultless,will
now
be
using
muscle
food
instead
of
any
supermarket
Good

product
timely
delivery
The
online
chat
is
helpful,
but
I've
felt
like
I
need
to
do
a
little
more
research
myself
as
the
techs
obviously
haven't
gotten
to
examine
every
product
as
an
actual
store
clerk
would.
I
know
a
professional
videographer
who
uses
them
and
that's
who
sent
me
their
way.
I
used
to
get
my
product
(Ultimate
Flora
Probiotic)
from
Amazon
but
it
took
10
days
with
the
Super
Saver
Shipping.

I
have
purchased
the
same
product
with
Pure
Formulas
twice
now
&
have
received
my
product
with
3
days.

No
turning
back
for
me!!!
Alles
super…
Easy
sit
to
place
your
order.

Good
value
for
your
money..

Postage
use
to
be
a
bit
quicker.
I
have
used
PartsGeek
several
times
and
they
have
always
provided
the
parts
I
needed
at
a
good
price
and
on
time.
plesently
surprised
i
was
able
to
operate
web
site
and
get
fixed
up
with
accomadation
I've
already
placed
another
order
after
receiving
the
first.

Price,
service
and
quality
are
all
just
great.
Good
work
and
polite,
friendly
service
at
a
very
fair
price
-
what
more
can
one
ask.
The
product
I
needed
at
a
very
competitive
price
despatched
quickly
and
arrived
in
perfect
condition.
Good
communication
throughout
the
process.
An
excllent
service.
Cheapest
by
far
for
the
item
I
wanted.
Paid
extra
for
next
day
delivery
which
arrived
as
promised.
All
in
all
a
great
deal
and
I
shall
be
using
comms
express
again.
We
had
a
a
last
minute
addition
for
our
recent
event.

Pinnacle
Promotions
replied
that
they
could
immediately
accommodate
a
last-minute,
rush
order
and
they
did!

I
haven't
seen
this
kind
of
rapid
response
in
a
long
time.

The
order
arrived
on
time,
the
items
were
beautiful
and
the
entire
experience
was
perfect.

Thank
you
Pinnacle
for
relieving
my
stress
and
coming
though
for
us.

You
have
a
new
customer
for
a
long
time
now.
First.
Wrong
Name.
I
was
looking
to
replace
my
Travelpro
wheels
that
broke
apart
so
I
searched
for
replacements.
Stopover
showed
the
option
of
upgrading
to
inline
skate
wheels.
I
ordered
them,
as
specification-wise
it
looked
as
though
they
would
fit.
I
received
them
in
a
couple
of
days
and
they
installed
perfectly.
I
expect
these
wheels
will
long
outlast
the
bag.
Purchase
was
straightforward.

The
toner
is
HP
original
and
I
am
happy
ordered
on
Friday
received
on
Wednesday
and
had
a
holiday
on
Monday
no
better
service
than
that,
also
price
was
very
fair.
This
summer
was
my
first
time
doing
a
backpacking
trip.
In
the
past
I
would
only
stay
in
hotels
but
noticed
that
paying
those
high
prices
would
limit
my
trip
in
any
country.
However,
when
I
found
out
there
were
other
options,
I
had
to
try
it.
Well,
there
is
only
one
way
to
describe
my
experience
and
that
is
-
amazing.
Hostelworld
provided
me
with
the
information
I
needed
to
make
an
educated
decision
as
to
where
to
stay.
Every
one
of
the
hostel
experiences
have
been
fantastic.
Try
it,
you
won't
regret
it.
I
have
used
Priceline
twice
and
saved
over
57
percent
when
I
rented
a
car.
I
normally
get
my
products
at
GNC.

My
trainer
told
me
about
supplement
warehouse
so
I
thought
I
would
give
it
a
try.

Although,
they
didn't
have
the
brand
names
she
had
written
down
for
me
to
purchase
I
found
items
very
similar
to
ones
I
was
already
using.

Once
I
got
used
to
the
search
feature
I
thought
the
site
was
very
easy
to
use
and
navigate.
I
would
give
five
stars
except
for
issue
with
the
checkout
page.
Payee
name/billing
address
fields
are
needed
where
you
enter
the
credit
card
number.
We
used
a
different
credit
card
and
the
payment
did
not
go
thru
because
the
name
on
the
card
did
not
match
the
billing
name
on
file.
The
card
was
frozen
for
"attempted
fraud"
as
a
result.
Great
service.
Easy
to
use
website.
Found
exactly
what
I
wanted
without
having
to
delve
in
to
the
depths
of
the
website.
Great
description
with
appropriate
measurements
(to
ensure
the
correct
purchase
of
this

fast

All
for

I
could
find...what

you
want?
What
a
refreshing
change
in
todays
retail
industry.
A
well
run
company
providing
top

with
exceptional

The
whole
experience
of
Heinnie
Haynes
is
great.
I
check
out
the
website
daily
to
see
what
new
products
they've
got
in.
Every
product
is
presented
in
a
clear
and
simple
way.
I
particularly
like
the
youtube
reviews
that
can
be
accessed
when
viewing
the
product
pics.
Ordering
is
simple.
I
always
opt
for
free
delivery.
If
I
order
on
a
Sunday,
I'm
always
excited
about
receiving
the
parcel
on
Tuesday
-
and
they've
never
disappointed.
The
parts
I
ordered
came
in
and
I
put
them
on
with
out
a
hitch.Everything
worked
as
it
should
have,and
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
quality
plus
the
price
of
these
parts.


Thank
you
from
me!!!
Bought
rear
light
assembly
for
my
2013
Kia
Soul.
I
was
worried
that
I
would
receive
a
cheap
knockoff
for
the
money
I
saved,
but
it
was
to
spec
and
have
not
been
this
pleased
with
an
online
purchase
in
a
long
time.
I
will
definitely
purchase
here
again
!

,
Makes
a
tough
situation
(having
to
quickly
get
a
new
tyre)
easy
as
you
like.
Logged
on,
put
in
my
car's
details
and
was
told
which
tyre
was
mine
and
was
presented
with
a
huge
selection.
They
were
rated
regarding
the
wet
weather
ability,
fuel
consumption
and
cabin
noise
so
I
was
able
to
choose
what
mattered
to
me.
Also
the
Tesco
clubcard
points
were
a
nice
incentive!
I
have
order
from
partsgreek
.com
before
and
my
experience
with
them
is
when
you
made
your
order
and
you
try
and
call
them
back
you
have
a
hard
time
getting
a
whole
of
some
one.When
you
make
a
order
and
you
make
a
mistake
after
you
check
out,

Fast

Good
quality

Will
order
again.
I've
bought
many
things
from
Heinnie.
Superfast
delivery,
very
attentive
customer
service
every
time.
Definitely
a
trusted
supplier!
I
bought
3
or
4
games
via
CJS
CD
Keys
and
I
get
them
in
5

It´s
Great.
Bought
a
bat
and

from

guys.
The
goods
were

Having
search
around
for
guidance
on
how
to
replace
my
cooker's
heating
element,
I
came
across
eSpares
who
demonstrated
how
to
do
the
job
and
also
supply
the
correct
part.
The
item
was
dispatched
very
quickly
and
I
was
able
to
fit
it
in
10
minutes.
I
have
since
used
them
for
a
set
of
washing
machine
bearings.
Would
recommend
eSpares
to
anyone.
This
was
the
first
time
I
have
used
ironmongerydirect.
The
service
was
first
class
and
I
have
already
recommended
them
to
my
colleagues
at
work.
The
interactive
web
site
gave
a
great
idea
as
to
what
our
chosen
design
would
look
like.
Once
the
order
was
placed
a
confirmation
email
was
sent
with
the
exact
design
we
had
chosen.
The
email
trail
kept
us
well
informed
at
all
stages
of
production
and
informed
us
when
the
sign
had
been
posted,
so
we
could
track
the
order.
My
wife
and
myself
have
used
tyre
shopper
for
many
years.
The
service
is
easy
to
use
and
you
can
choose
when
you
want
the
tyres
to
be
fitted.
The
price
is
very
cheap
and
there
are
no
hidden
extras.
I

this

people.
This
was
my

oil
delivery
since
moving
in.
I
was
told
that
the
oil
would
be
delivered
within
10
days.
2
days
later
the
oil
turned
up
and
the
tank
filled
whilst
I
was
at
work.
Everything
worked
super
efficient,
I
cannot
recommend
BoilerJuice
highly
enough.

As
anyone
would
be,
i
was
skeptical
about
buying
a

key
online.
But
after
seeing
BF3
Premium
was
almost
£40
from

i
thought
i
would
give
it
a
go.
Very
easy
to
make
booking

and
received
email
to
confirm
booking
and
details
of
price.
And
dates.also
nothing
to
pay
until
arrive
at

Selecting
and
purchase
was
easy,
but
delivery
took
much
longer
than
advertised.
I
realize
it
is
getting
close
to
Christmas,
but
when
you
pay
for
2
day
delivery,
6
days
is
unacceptable.
I've
ordered
many
an
item
from
B&H,
and
I've
never,
never
had
a
problem.
If
you
call
for
information
on
the
particular
product
that
you
are
interested
in,
someone
who
actually
knows
the
product
is
there
to
answer
any
of
your
questions.
It's
always
a
pleasure
shopping
here.

a

easier
way
to

going

It's
like
stapes.com,
you
can
just
do
everything
w/o
going
to
the

And
it's
quick.
Excellent

I

is
working
roughly
as

took
a

what
I
expected.
Good

(about
the

I

some

retailers.
I
was
contacted
within
a
couple
of
hours
to
inform
me
that
the
guitar
I
had
ordered
was
out
of
stock
and
might
not
be
with
me
until
the
end
of
the
following
week.
In
actual
fact
it
arrived
within
3
days!
Staff
on
the
telephone
were
very
helpful
and
easy
to
deal
with.
Would
definitely
recommend
GAK

will
be
my
first

Many
thanks!
The
Parts
I
ordered,
and
what
was
advertised
in
their
online
catalog
varied
a
little
from
what
was
delivered..
It
is
not
the
entirely
PartsGeek's
fault
-
but
they
should
have
verified
what
is
being
sold
prior
to
selling
it
and
just
being
a
"Parts
Broker".
I
RECENTLY
ORDERD
FROM
AMI
CLUB

WEAR
VERY
SATISFIED
THE
SHIPPING
WAS
VERY
FAST
MY
ORDER
IS
CORRECT
AND
THEY
MADE
SURE
I
GOT
IT
BEFORE
CHRISTMAS,
THE
ONLY
THING
I
DIDNT
LIKE
IS
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
SMALL
CHIP
ON
THE
BOOT
BUT
NOTHING
BIG
AND
ONE
MORE
THING
IS
THAT
THEY
WILL
NEVER
ANSWER
THERE
PHONE
OR
RESPOND
TO
YOUR
EMAILS
THEY
WILL
ONLY
SEND
YOU
A
EMAIL
ONCE
YOUR
PACKAGE
IS
OUT
FOR
DELIVERY
BUT
STILL
GOOD
I
WILL
BE
SHOPPIN
AGAIN
WITH
THEM.........DONT
BELIEVE
THE
NEGATIVE
FEED
BACK!!!
CAUSE
IT
JUST
HAS
YOU
WORRIED
THINKING
YOUR
GONNA
GET
ROBBED
UNTILL
YOU
RECIEVE
IT
EVERYTHINGS
CORRECT
THEN
YOU
LOOK
DUMB..THE
SHIPPIN
IS
EXPENSIVE
BUT
YOU
THINK
YOUR
GONNA
RECIEVE
IT
IN
5
DAYS
AND
YOU
RECIEVE
IT
IN
3
DAYS!
BUT
ONE
MORE
THING
I
CAN
SAY
IS
BULLSHIT
IS
HOW
WHEN
YOUR
ORDERING
ON
THERE
WEB
SITE
IT
SAYS
FREE
SHIPPING
IF
ORDER
OS
OVER
50
THATS
FALSE
NO
FREE
SHIPPING!!
PLUS
YOU
GET
CHARGED
WITH
EXPENSIVE
SHIPPING
THATS
ABOUT
IT
OVER
ALL

I

it

that

Often

of
concurrents
when
the

In

it

Mom
wife
had
purchased
a
reference
book
for
work
through
BookByte
and
was
very
satisfied
with
the
price
and
service.
When
it
came
time
to
buy
books
for
our
two
children
in
private
high
school,
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
compare
Bookbyte
to
the
schools
recommended
book
supplier.
I'm
sure
glad
I
did!!!
I
saved
around
20%
of
the
total
cost.
All
but
one
of
the
books
on
the
lengthy
list
was
immediately
available.
Qualified
for
free
shipping.
Great
service
-
got
confirmation
and
tracking
#'s
within
24
to
48
hours,
and
all
books
arrived
within
10
days,
most
within
4
days.
I
purchased
some
new
and
some
used
books,
and
the
used
books
were
in
good
condition
as
stated
on
the
website.
I
definately
plan
to
use
Bookbyte
in
the
future
and
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
needing
books!
I
ordered
a
pedalboard
and
was
told
it
would
be
next
day
delivery,
the
actual
delivery
was
around
2
weeks
later.
I
booked
my
car
in
with
PTA
Bromley
through
Black
Circles.

On
arrival,
I
explained
that
the
car
was
fresh
from
a
nuts
and
bolt
rebuild
and
asked
them
to
take
when
when
lifting
the
car,
so
as
to
not
mark
and/or
damage
anything.

On
hearing
this,
they
took
the
car
into
the
MOT
slot
so
they
could
lift
the
car
on
wood
blocks.

They
were
not
in
a
rush
and
took
their
time
to
put
on
the
new
rubber
too.
Reliability
is
good
so
far!
Not
sure
about
call

though!
Improvement
needed
by

Alternatively,
setting

This
was
my
first
track
day
ever
having
just
got
a

car.
The
day
went
very
well,
the
organisation
was
very
good
and
the
instruction
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
was
clear.
Unlike
MyWOT,
their
rating
system
is
reliable
so
far.
I
installed
their
add-on
to
my
browser
and
it's

working
very
smooth
and
light.
It
doesn't
bother
you
with
pop-ups
etc.

I
didn't
see
any
biased
rating
so
far.
They
have
a
very
good
online
store.
Simple
and
easy
to
browse.
I
rate
it
5
star.
Very
good
to
get
some
real
reviews
about
hotels.
The
reviews
saved
my
trip
quite
a
few
times.
I
purchased
a
few
items
from
Amazon
and
received
them
without
any
hassle.
So
far
so
good.
We
love
working
with
Paypal
so
far.
Easy

However,
their

system
needs
to
be
improved.
Partsgeek

than
half
what
Autozone

same
part.

I
had
it
in
three
days.

With
a
little
effort,
a
350
dollar
shop
repair
became
a
40
dollar
shade
tree
mechanic
fix.

Like
most
of
you
guys,
it's
not
so
much
the
money
as
the
pride
in
fixing
it
yourself.
This
is
one
of
the
best
customer
service
experiences
I
have
had
with
an
online
retailer,.
Not
only
did
I
feel
safe
with
ordering
online
I
was
also
confidant
that
I
would
get
what
I
ordered
in
a
timely
manner.
I
am
a
very
diligent
on-line
shopper
who
looks
for
high
quality
products
at
the
lowest
possible
price,
with
no
BS.

Pure
Formulas
seems
to
fit
that
bill
perfectly.

Selection
is
excellent,
shipping
is
quick,
and
the
reward
program
makes
it
an
even
better
value.

Doesn't
get
too
much
better
than
that!
Yes
I
will

service
for
me

already
recommended
this
company
to
my
wife
on
the
basis
of
reviews
I
had
seen.
We
were
pleased
with
here
specs,
so
I
decided
to
order
a
pair
as
spare
for
myself.
The
so
called
spare
pair
are
now
in
constant
use
as
the
quality
is
very
good.
My
only
regret
is
that
I
didn't
opt
for
dearer
more
substantial
frames
,
but
what
I've
got
was
well
worth
the
cost.
Would
recommend
them
for
their
prompt
response
to

placed,
and
their

The

is
exactly
what
I
expected.
The
posting
was

the

They
were
very
helpful
in
my

No

2
days
after
my
order,
I
received
a
small
box
in
the
mail
containing
2
strings
of
micro
led
lights
and
a
remote
control
absolutely
free.
What
a
surprise.
A
week
later
I
received
my
full
order
of
awning
and
hardware
in
excellent
condition.
I
am
very
impressed
with
my
experience.
I
absolutely
recommend
them.

When
considering
the
treatment
that
I
received
from
Mark
Williams
and
the
rest
of
the
Flashbay
team,
it
was
done
so
professionally,
so
quickly
and
the
product
that
I
received
at
the
end
was
perfect
that
I
can
truly
say
that
you
guys
have
really
taken
service
to
a
whole
new
level!
We
are
truly
impressed.
I
just
ordered
for
the
first
time
from
SW
and
I
will
tell
you,
with
the
plenty
of
research
I
did
in
attempts
to
find
the
best
prices..
SW
took
the
cake.
I
have
yet
to
recieve
my
supplements,
but
with
all
the
positive
feedback
that
people
are
giving,
I
dont
think
there
will
be
a
problem.
I
would
never
use
these
guys.

Expedia
and
Hyatt
should
be
sick
to
have
this
company
as
a
partner.

They
mislead
you
to
believe
you
are
actually
dealing
with
Hyatt
direct
with
deceptive
website.

They
lied
about
a
second
party
being
able
to
check
in
with
a
photo
id
only
despite
fully
charging
my
credit
card
in
advance.

Their
call
center
in
Honduras
hung
up
on
me
twice
trying
to
resolve
issue
and
said
a
supervisor
wasn't
available.

They
are
liars.

Their
contact
info
on
the
American
Express
billing
was
a
fax
line.

I
have
filed
a
disputed
charge
investigation
with
American
Express.

Hyatt
customer
relations
indicated
this
wasn't
the
first
issue
with
this
company.

After
30
years
of
staying
with
Hyatt,
I
will
quit
if
they
don't
support
me
on
this.

made
travelling
on

so
much

knowing
you
didnt
need
to
find

bus
etc
etc
If
you
pay
low
prices
you
still
want
reasonable
support.

Their
handling

is
reasonable.

for

was

was

I
would

the

the

the

Will
definitely
do
business
again
This
is
not
a
totally
negative
review.

I
would
do
business
with
them
again.
It
was
just
circumstance
that
they
were
unable
to
fill
my
order
prior
to
Christmas
for
a
gift.

They
quickly
refunded
my
money
upon
request
and
communication
was
good
for
that
effort.

One
critique
I
would
provide
is
that
they
should
have
communicated
to
me
proactively
that
this
order
would
not
arrive
before
Christmas.

That
was
a
bummer
and
I
spent
double
on
another
controller
to
make
a
10
year
old
boy
happy.
Three
stars
on
order
timing
and
communication;
4
stars
on
a
quick
response
to
my
cancellation.
As
a
computer,
electronics,
and
music
corporation
owner,
I
have
been
dealing
with
this
company
for
almost
two
years.

I
have
placed
numerous
orders
with
no
problems,
but
there
has
been
an
occasional
glitch.

Although
rarely
needed,
with
one
phone
call,
any
issue
was
solved
courteously,
immediately,
and
without
question.

The
absolute
best
customer
service
I
have
ever
encountered.

I
very
highly
recommend
them.
The
item
I
ordered
arrived,
packed
very
well,
2
days
after
I
ordered.
Communication
was
great
and
the
item
I
received
was
correct
and
worked
prefectly.
The
consultant
was
well
informed,
efficient
and
helpful.

I
had
an
issue
with
payment
which
he
sorted
out
to
my
benefit.

I

I
called
and
the
lady
told
me
that
it
would
be

the
following
Monday,
and
according
to
the

and

the

is
better

been
shown
so

I
really

worked
with
me

I
ran
into
some
hick-ups
in
the
process.
You
folks
are
great,
extremely
willing
to
work
with
your
customers
and
I
would
recommend
you
to
anyone
thinking
of
purchasing
a
steel
building.
As
soon
as
I
finish
the
project,
I
will
be
sending
you
some
photos
of
the
steps
that
I
went
through
in
erecting
my
building.
Again,
thank
you
and
all
the
folks
at
Armstrong
for
a
great
experience
with
this
project.
Great
deals
and
great
service.

from
them
or

have

thru
them.
I
have
no
hesitation
in
using
them
again
in
the
future.
Their
prices
are
reasonable
and
competitive
also..............................
I
will
order

you!!!

very
professional
and
a
good
price,
couriers
were
late
and
did
not
contact
us,
repairs4
did
their
best
and
kept
us
updated
and
we
got
the
goods
eventually,
they
were
very
professional
as
a
firm
I
was
involved
in
a
accident
where
my
back
taillight
was
damaged
and
immediately
wanted
it
fixed
so
came
to
partsgeek.com.

I
had
never
bought
from
them
but
the
prices
looked
good.

I
received
a
box
a
week
later
expecting
a
taillight
and
instead
received
a
mirror
for
a
truck.

I
came
to
find
out
that
I
had
to
e-mail
about
the
mix
up
and
couldn't
phone
in.

I
received
an
e-mail
back
saying
that
I
would
have
to
send
it
back
AND
pay
for
shipping
due
to
their
complications.

Currently
....
2
and
a
half
weeks
after
I
bought
the
taillight
I
am
still
waiting
on
e-mails
so
I
can
send
the
part
back.

Even
worse
is
that
they
do
not
have
an
exchange
program
setup
so
I
will
have
to
just
reorder
the
tailight
instead
of
them
just
sending
me
what
I
really
need.

I
would
rather
instead
of
"credit"
that
I
would
just
have
a
full
refund
so
I
can
deal
with
someone
else.

I
am
confused
as
to
how
this
company
is
ran
without
a
knowledgeable
call
center.

I
feel
like
things
would
get
taken
care
of
a
lot
faster
for
people
like
me
that
need
the
part
ASAP
if
there
were
a
phone
service
offered.

I
am
very
disappointed
and
hope
that
something
gets
done
fast.

My
irritation
level
is
growing
more
and
more
everyday
I
receive
an
e-mail
that
seems
generated
by
a
computer
instead
of
a
caring
person
that
understands
that
I
need
the
part
and
not
just
want
it.

always
met
or
exceeded
my
expectations.

I
always
receive
my
shipments
promptly
and
on
the
occasion
that
I
needed
to
return
an
item,
the
experience
was
completely

The
icing
on
the
cake
is
that
customers
get
10%

I

The

of

did
say
that
it

a

but
it
didn't

that

with
a
"flat

at
the
end
of
the
cord,
which
doesn't
fit
a

to
contact
Priceline
in

to
add

to
my

had
been
delayed
by

the

was
at

but
couldn't
be
admitted
to
the
room.

I
called
priceline
on
my
cell
phone
to
make
the
change
and
found
that
I
needed
to
use
a
touch
tone
phone
rather
than
my
cell
phone
to
navigate
the
menu.

I
was
at
an
airport
terminal
building
and
had
to
locate
a
touch

phone
in
order
to
complete
the
call.

This
makes
no
sense
to
me.

I
was
pressed
for
time
and
the
use
of
my
cell
phone
would
have
made
the
transaction
much
simpler
and
faster.

I
was
also
talking
to
a

who
never
did

I
ordered
a

for
my

almost
two
weeks

and
it

No
where
on

did/does
it

that
it

to

in

for

Suffice
it
to
say
that
while
I
will
reserve
judgement
on
the
product,
the
company
itself
is
horrible
with

(they

and
I
won't

where
and
how
I
was

on

But
after

and
then
to
Three,
I
discovered
that
the
request
you
put
through
to

up
the
new

with
Three
was
incomplete.
I
have
registered

but
I
have
still

Three
said
that
they
are
looking
into

and
I

This
is

that

While
the
part
came
in
quicker
than
I

it
fell
apart
several
days
after
I
ordered
it.
I
had
ordered
a
passenger
side
door
seal
for
my
06
Wrangler
Rubicon.
The
replacement
went
pretty
smoothly,
but
the
gasket
somehow
separated
(
came
apart
)
at
the
midway
point
on
the
inside
edge
of
the
door.
I
plan
to
order
another
one
as
soon
as
I
get
enough
money
too,
but
I
am
disappointed
and

somewhat
baffled
by
the
breakage
of
the
door
gasket.

The

was
very
cordial
and
helpful
with
my
transaction.
Upon

I
had
to
wait
for

about
30
minutes
before
being
picked
up.
My
item
arrived
within
seven
days
of
having
ordered
it.
I
purchased
from
parts

because
of
there
prices.
I
saw
on

that
they

and
I
got
a

It
has
been
2
weeks
and
still
no

I
even
tried
calling
and
there
customer
service
was
a
recording
saying
pretty
much
that
where
to
busy
to
talk
to
you.
It
said
to
go
out
and
fill
out
a
form
on
there
website
to
be
called
back.
All
I
want
is
my
money
back
because
I
had
to
purchase
from
the
dealer.
I
wouldn't
ever
recommend
using
this
company.

Having
previously
ordered
a
new
bath
from
Bathrooms123
which
went
into
liquidation
before
my
order
was
delivered
it
was
with
some
trepidation
that
I
ordered
from
another
company
that
I
didn't
know
anything
about.
I
needn't
have
worried;
BetterBathrooms
are
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with.
These
people
at
B&H
know
how
to
treat
their
customers.
A+

this
company

times

Heinnie
Hayes
offers
the
sort
of
service
that
we
all
want
but
often
don't
get.
wonderful
services!!!!!!!!!!
Product
was

quickly
and
as
described.
I
didn't
have
to
wait
a
second.
Once
I
purchased
the
item,
it
was
ready
to
be
used
in
game.
Never
had
any
issues,
always
fast
delivery
and
alway
get
exactly
what
I've
ordered.
Would
be
great
but
for
"your"
rubbish
you
put
in
package
when
sent
out.
I've
had
nothing
but
good
experience
over
the
years.
Amazed
to
see
next-day

now
added!
Couldn't
recommend
Heinnie
highly
enough!
If
you

this

company

The
food

out
at

and
i
dont
think
petci
carries
it
at
all
and
pf
always
has
it.
Petflow
is
great
for
people
like
me
who
are
busy
and
dont
want
to
waste
there
limited
free
time
going
to
the
store.
With
the
subscription
discount
there
price
including
shipping
is
about
.50
cents
more
than
going
to
petstmart
and
i
will
glady
spend
.50
cents
to
save
thirty
minutes
my
time
on
my
one

I
have
been
a
customer
for
a
long
time
and
will
continue
to
come
back.
Everything
that
I
need
in

place,
better
prices
than
you
can
find
anywhere
else,
and
dropped
off
at
my
door.
What
more
could
you
ask
for?
Oh
yea,

there's
plenty
of
that
and
I've
yet
to
be

with

Customer

BH
Photo
is
my
trusted
photographic
equipment
supplier.
They
are
serious
and
committed
to
their
customers.
Never
heard
of
Bookbyte
before
I
rented
from
them
this
semester,
and
I
am
glad
that
I
did.
The
books
look
brand

and
they
offered
the
best
prices
I
could
find
to
rent.
The
online
live

service
of
product

and
general

is
reliable
and
very

Could
not

more

-
this

provided
exactly
what
we
all
look
for
in

I
found
them
on

the

the

typically

I
spend
a
lot
of
time
fixing
older
and
rare
cars
with
hard
to
find
parts.

PartsGeek
is
almost
always
a
one

shop
for
replacement
parts
with
a
wide
selection
of
different
things
most
parts
places
would
send
you
to
specialty
shops
for.

I
have
never
gotten
the
wrong
part
from
them
so
I
can't
speak
to
how
well
they
handle
any
errors
but
the
fact
that
after
a
high
number
of
transactions
I
have
not
run
into
one
yet
seems
to
speak
well
for
the

I
have
now
had
extensive
dealings
with
Heinnie
Haynes,
and
the
customer
service
is
probably
the
best
I
have
ever
experienced
shopping
on
the
internet,
it
is
a
pity
that
more
company's
do
not
apply
a
similar
dedication
towards
their
customer
service.
I
looked
around
the
web
and
made
a
list
of
5
web
design
companies.
They
all
came
within
a
similar
price
but
I
like
WebCreationUK's
portfolio
best.
They
were
also
the
only
company
to
bother
to
call
me
back.
I
had
already
once
been
'stung'
by
another
small
web
design
company
that
I
found
out
later
ran
from
a
bedroom.
WebCreationUK
have
a
lovely
office
which
I
was
lucky
enough
to
visit
so
that
I
could
explain
my
project
fully.
The
website
was
done
within
the
timescale
I
provided
and
I
would
absolutely
use
them
again
in
the
future.
Thanks
guys!
I

The

to

at

also
found
their

Our

us
the

and

from
them
again
if
this

:)
Went
to
buy
a
two
seater
sofa
at
Birstsll
near
Leeds
as
there
are
a
number
of
furniture
stores
on
one
site.
Had
the
life
harassed
out
of
us
at
the
first
one,
they
were
waiting
like
a
pack
when
we
opened
the
door.
Into
the
next
with
some
trepidation
it
was
Sofaworks.
Immediately
could
tell
the
difference.
A
welcome
"
hello"
and
an
invitation
to
seek
out
any
member
of
staff
for
information
was
all
we
had
to
contend
with.
Unmolested
tour,
choice
made,
money
paid
and
we
were
on
our
way.
That's
the
way
to
buy
furniture.
First
order
of
door
and
window
handles
delivered
within
24hrs.
Quality
and
value
were
unbelievably
good.
So
I
tested
them
again
with
a
repeat
order
so
that
I
could
complete
the
renewal
of
door
and
window
furniture
throughout
the
house.
They
came
up
trumps
again.
Once
might
have
been
good
luck
but
twice
tells
me

this
is
normal
practice.
Can't
recommend
them
highly
enough.
Did
the
usual
search
engine
investigation
for
replacement
electric
toothbrush
heads
and
came
across
Molarclean.
The
prices
for
bulk
buys
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
compared
to
the
exhorbitant
cost
of
manufacturer
replacements.
Order
placed,
delivered
a
few
days
later
and
delighted
with
quality
product
that
fitted
and
worked
just
as
well
as
the
over
priced
"real
thing."
I
now
clean
my
teeth
with
a
smile
on
my
face.
Very
reliable,
right
product

no

I
bought
a
oil
cooler
kit
for
my
06'
Chyrsler
Pacifica.
The
oil
cooler
do
not
fit
the
existing
mouting
bracket.
I
needed
the
car
back
in
service
ASAP;

had
to
fabricate
the
bracket.
Unit
worked
great
for
the
first
couple
hundred
miles,
now
it
it
leaks.
Also,
the
hardware
the
kit
came
with
was
not
correct.
Using
a
1/2"
bolt
that
takes
a
flat
blade
screw
driver
instead
of
a
hex
bolt
is
very
ackward
to
position
the
shock
mounts
in
the
core
componet.
The
oil
filter
adapter
is
a
clever
design,
works
great,
simple
install;
If
you
have
the
ability
to

change
the
engine
oil
you
should

The
design
is

Delivery
and
Product
exactly
as
promised,
it
was
delivered
during
the
time
slot
given,
we
even
got
a
phone
call
to
say
they
were
about
3
miles
away.
When
buying
from
a
new
to
you
company
you
always
hope
for
a
good
experience
but
rarely
does
the
company
exceed
your
expectations.
I
can
say
that
my
purchase
from
Hudson
Reed
was
exceptional
in
every
way
possible.
I
purchased
online
and
it
was
quick
and
easy.
My
purchase
was
sent
out
within
24
hours
and
my
free
shipping
had
my
purchase
to
me
in
3
short
days.
What
I
received
was
exactly
what
I
ordered
with
the
exception
that
the
quality
was
far
better
than
my
expectations.
I
will
most
certainly
order
from
Hudson
Reed
again.

B&H
has
always
delivered
what
it
promises.

I
started
dealing
with
this
company
about
eighteen
months
ago.

I
have
purchased
a
pro
printer,D800
and
a
few
pro
lenses
along
with
paper
supplies
and
ink,
the
prices
are
competitive
but
just
as
important
to
me
I
have
never
had
to
question
a
packing
slip,
an
invoice
etc.

What
I
ordered
is
what
I
got.

I
have
used
both
telephone
and
internet
ordering
services,
B&H
delivers.
I
have
ordered
glasses
online
before,
and
haven't
always
been
thrilled
with
the
results.

In
fact,
this
is
the
first
time
I
am!

For
the
money,
these
glasses
are
just
about
perfect.

They
fit
great,
the
prescription
is
spot
on
perfect
too.
Ordered
something,
didn't
read
the
full
blurb
and
emailed
customer
service
for
information.
Canon
compatible
cartridges
worked
perfect
in
my
printer
and
I
would
recommend
Hunt's
to
anyone
for
office
products.
Delivery
was
speedy
and
was
carried
out

5
attempts
at
trying
to
post
a
review
about
a
hotel
and
not
able
to
successfully
have
any
one
of
them
published,
was
my
first
impression
with
Trip
Advisor.
The
help
desk
said
that
they
have
software
that
picks
up
certain
keywords
and
this
prevents
certain
reviews
from
getting
published.
But
5
attempts???
A
bed
bug
problem
in
a
hotel
is
something
I
feel
the
public
should
know
about.
No
one
should
have
to
go
through
the
experience
my
family
and
I
went
through.
Why
should
the
public
not
be
informed
of
such
a
significant
problem?
Does
not
make
any
sense.
If
the
TA
gets
paid
off
by
certain
businesses
from
having
negative
reviews
posted,
than
this
makes
more
sense
as
to
why
none
of
my
reviews
have
gotten
published.
Had

I
thought
I
had
found
a
better
deal
on
another
pet
food
delivery
site...
and
they
almost
had
me.
I
found
the
food
I
was
looking
for
at
what
appeared
to
be
an
unbeatable
price.
It
was
a
whole
$10.00
less
than
any
other
site,
including
PetFlow.
At
least,
that's
how
it
appeared
until
I
got
to
the
checkout.
I
was
one
click
away
from
submitting
my
order
when
the
delivery
charge
was
first
displayed.
That
site
wanted
to
charge
me
$12.95
for
shipping.
I
went
to
PetFlow
where
I
found
the
same
food
for
$10.00
more,
but
they
only
charged
a
flat
rate
shipping
fee
of
$4.95
IF
you
didn't
qualify
for
the
FREE
shipping.
The
free
shipping
was
on
orders
of
$49.00
or
more.
My
order
came
to
$48.99...
which
meant
I
didn't
qualify
for
the
free
shipping.
I
contacted
PetFlow
and
asked
if
we
could
work
something
out
since
I
was
only
$0.01
short
of
qualifying
for
the
free
shipping.
The
lady
I
worked
with
gave
me
another
code
extending
the
free
shipping
to
me
on
all
repeat
deliveries
of
the
product
I
was
ordering!
I
like
the
ability
to
clasify
on
rate
and
to
open
a
map
of
the
locations.

I
ordered
the

versions
of
Asuna's
and
Kirito's

from

through

price
was
excellent,
the
quality
of
the
swords
is
fantastic,
and
I
am
very
happy
with
the
purchase.
The
shipping
was
a
little
delayed,
but
that
was
to
be

the

were
made

I
was
shocked
at
the
way
my
T-shirts
turned
out!!!


They
looked
great,
I
thought
I
would
test
with
black
lettering
and
white
shirts.

LOOKED
AMAZING.

I
am
looking
forward
to

more
designs

colors!!!!!

For
all
of
you
guys
wondering
"CAN
I
make
my
own
T-shirts?"
I
am
here
to
tell
you
"YES
YOU
CAN!!!!"


I
went
out
on
a
limb
and
bought
the
press,
and
just
did
it!!!!!

Well
worth
it!!!!
SAVED
a
ton
of
money
and
the
shirts
look
GREAT!!!!!!
So
fast!

I
love
it!
Ordered
the
large
30cm
clock
with
my
own
design,
hoping
to
have
something
snazzy
in
the
kitchen
lol.
It
took
approx
10-14
days
and
needed
signing,
but
unfortunately,
wasn't
right
when
it
arrived.
It
was
quite
apparent
too,
with
the
outer
design
off-centre
and
obviously
not
what
I
wanted.
An
email
discussion
over
the
next
24hrs
advised
me
to
return
it
in
the
packing
with
the
prepaid
label,
so
far
so
good!
I
found
Easy
to
book
a
very
user
friendly
website,
allowing
me
to
find
a
viable
place
with
relative
ease.
I
was
ale
to
find
a
place
within
a
few
minutes
however,
this
was
troubled
due
to
the
many
different
choices
I
had
found
whilst
looking
through
the
website.
Concerning
the
booking
I
found
it
extremely
easy
taking
me
under
a
minute
to
complete
the
booking.
I
have
bought
several
products
from
Lightinthebox,
and
the
prices
are
always
really
low,
they
have
fantastic
deals,
and
they
have
a
huge
selection,
items
in
every
category,
and
I
have
always
been
impressed
with
the
fast
shipping.
You
should
go
check
it
out.
Really.
Now.
This
was
one
of
if
not
the
best
experience
that
I
have
had
in
ordering
promotional
gear.
From
begining
to
end
it
was
a
smooth
process.
I
look

to
the
next
purchase.

first
time
i
have
used
this
company
i
had
a
small
problem
with
one
off
the
yeasts
that
purchased
and
they
sent
me
a
new
yeast
out
as
a
replacement
very
quickly

all
the
goods
came
very
well
packaged
and
will
be
using

Ordered
the
pump
late
on
Sunday
evening
and
it
arrived
first-thing
Tuesday
morning.

Compared
to
similar
spec
pump
from
B&Q
etc
this
pump
was
a
better
brand
and
£70
cheaper.
Like

quick
service
excelente...
Left
the
store
/dealer
and
told
them
I'll
be
back
tomorrow
to
please
have
everything
ready
for
me
to
sign,
they
did
not
the
third
day
I
sat
at
the
dealer
2
hrs
unnecessarily,
told
the
manager
that
I
had
to
leave
by
2pm
and
right
at
that
moment
they
realized
the
car
did
not
have
an
inspection,
they
"sneaked"
the
vehicle
to
get
inspected
when
they
knew
I
had
very
little
time
to
spare,
the
sales
person
mr.
Bachelor
was
apologetic
but
the
rest
of
the
staff
was
not,
the
lady
who
put
the
paperwork
together
"Kim?"
was
rude
when
I
asked
how
much
longer.
I'm
very
satisfied
with
the
vehicle
and
the
price.
Also
they
waited
till
the
third
day
to
bring
the
car
from
the
north
side
location.
I
received
the
vehicle
dirty
due
to
weather
and
not
fueled
due
to
their
gas
card
not
working.
I
will
recommend
people
to
the
store
with
mr.
Bachelor
because
the
vehicle
is
great
and
the
price
was
fair.
I
will
never
order
from
these
bait
and
switch
artist
again-BEWARE
read
the
policies,they
DO
NOT
favor
YOU.
I
bought
this
warranty
and
really
wasn't
expecting
much
when
i
needed
to
make
a
claim.
I
was
wrong,
they
were
pleasant,
and
eager
to
help.
I
received
my
money
almost
instantly.
What
impressed
me
the
most
was
I
ordered
the
part
and
it
was
deliver
"free"
in
less
than
24
hours.

This
is
unbelievable
in
this
day
and
time.
Had
a
great
first
time
experience
with
Petflow!
I
will
be
ordering
from
them
again!
The
website
had
all
the
information
needed
so
I
was
able
to
select
precisely
what
I
wanted.
The
ordering
process
was
easy
and
the
order
arrived
next
day.
Great
service,
quick
delivery.
Good
communications
by
email.
Excellent
service,
jury's
still
out
on
the
actual
product
as
it
is
early
days.
However,
first
impressions
are
vety
favourable.
This
company
offers
great
value
and
service
and
delivery
are
first
class.

Any
complaints
are
dealt
with
promptly
and
satisfactorily
Do
not
order
from
this
company!
I
placed
my
order
back
in
Sept
2012
and
to
this
very
day
have
not
received
merchandise
or
a
refund!

Contacted
them
the
first
time
a
few
days
after
the
a
delivery
date
they
promised
in
the
confirmation
email.

It
is
odd
how
they
don't
have
a
customer
service
phone
number/line
and
you
have
to
go
and
"chat"
on
their
website
if
you
have
issues.
My
first
dispute
about
the
merchandise
not
arriving
was
counter
with
telling
me
to
wait
a
few
more
days
since
there
might
be
some
delays.
I
agreed.
Two
weeks
later
nothing
came!
Contacted
them
again...
was
told.
Things
are
on
back
order
and
they
will
re-order
and
re-send
my
items.
I
agreed.
So
I
waited
and
forgot
all
about
my
order.
Holiday
season
other
things
on
my
mind,
until
I
received
an
email
about
snugg
offers.
So
in
December
I
got
online
and
spoke
with
a
person
named
Hannah
who
claims
to
be
the
customer
service
manager.
I
was
thru
with
snugg
and
just
wanted
a
refund
on
my
purchase.
She
told
me
she
would
have
to
contact
the
warehouse
to
see
if
it
was
sent
out
or
what
happened
and
then
she
will
process
my
refund.
This
brings
me
to
today!
No
refund
nothing....
So
I
got
online
again!
Talked
to
another
person
named
Shauni
who
told
me
she
would
have
to
talk
to
Hannah
to
see
what
happened.
She
also
said
they
will
look
at
it
with
in
24
hours
and
I
will
receive
an
email
about
the
status.
What
is
wrong
with
this
company!
I
just
want
a
refund
on
items
I
never
got!
Don't
take
my
money
in
the
first
place
if
you
don't
have
the
merchandise
to
sell!
So
now
its
even
harder
to
get
my
money
back
and
of
course
I
never
got
any
merchandise!
I'm
located
in
the
USA
so
I
don't
know
if
all
the
positive
review
are
from
the
UK,
but
this
company
is
scamming
me
right
now.
I
just
want
my
money
back!
WILL
NOT
EVER
RECOMMEND
OR
ORDER
FROM
THIS
COMPANY
AGAIN!
This
is
the
latest
of
many
orders.

As
with
the
others,
ordering
was
easy.

Updates
concerning
the
order
were
timely.

The
merchandise
was
well
packed
and
arrived
in
perfect
condition.

I
highly
recommend
West
Coast
Shaving!!
i
bought
it
online
via
download
becouse
i
wanted
to
dowload
over
the
night
when
i
slept
but
they
sent
it
after
7.5
hours.........and
it
was
with
paypal,
and
that
is
an
instant
payment.....****
that
****
its
cheap,
you
shoud
go
there.
Received
the
wrong
filter
the
first
time.

By
the
time
I
got
the
right
part
I
would
have
been
better
off
buying
it
locally
because
I
ended
paying
for
shipping
twice.

They
did
refund
the
price
of
the
returned
part
but
I
was
still
out
the
cost
of
shipping
it
back
and
the
cost
of
shipping
the
first
part.
Not
to
mention
the
extra
two
week
delay
in
between
returning
the
first
one
and
the
second
one
arriving.
Probably
won't
try
that
again.
I
ordered
some
Mira
shower
parts.
Once
I
placed
my
order
I
was
quickly
informed
that
one
of
the
partsvwasvout
of
stock
and
so
there
would
be
a
delay.i
received
frequent
e
mails
informing
me
of
progress
and
once
the
parts
were
in
stock
they
were
quickly
dispatched.
When
I
ordered
from
Beverly
Diamonds,
I
was
first
a
bit
hesitant
but
after
ordering,
I
FELT
AMAZING!

Customer
service
was
absolutely
amazing.

I
was
quoted
the
same
price
as
paying
upfront
even
though
I
fianced.

The
ring
arrived
in
less
then
24
Hours
and
when
I
opened
it
to
see
if
my
soon
to
be
fiancé
would
be
satisfied,
I
was
above
and
beyond
satisfied!

She
loved
it
and
we
are
now
planning
the
wedding.

Thank
you
Beverly
Diamond!!
No
hesitation
I
would
work
with
them
again.

Whenever
I
preorder
games
from
amazon
I'm
likely
to
receive
the
game
1
or
2
days
after
launch-
I
may
as
well
go
buy
it
in
my
local

Great
choice

I
ordered
a
photo
book.

I
downloaded
the
book
tool
to
enable
me
to
put
the
book
together
myself
and
I
found
it
easy
to
use
with
lots
of
different
backgrounds
and
styles.

I
particularly
liked
that
you
could
use
one
of
your
own
photos
as
a
background.

The
book
arrived
really
quickly
in
time
for
mother's
day
and
was
of
good
quality
and
the
photos
were
really
clear.

I
was
very
pleased.

After
a
horrible
experience
ordering
precious
metals
from
another
online
company,
that
was
only
resolved
with
the
intervention
of
BBB,
I
was
thrilled
to
find
one
that
actually
follows
through
with
what
they
promise.
Suffice
to
say,
very
pleased.
Great
experience

Though
I
have
been

away

by
claims

better
/cheaper

products
I
have
always
returned,
quickly,
to
Muscleform.
Service
is
always
excellent
and,
on
the
one
occassion,
when
there
was
a
minor
problem
it
was
dealt
with
very
quickly
and
professionally!
Great
price,

I
could
find
for

I
wanted!

Would

Ordered

Everything
worked

and
the

I

I
have
used

Replacement
Lens
Express
changed
trifocal
lenses
in
two
pairs
of
glasses
for
me
recently.
The
first
pair
was
perfect
-
prescription,
PD,
and
segment
height
were
all
just
as
I
requested.
The
second
pair
was
not
quite
as
good.
The
prescription
and
PD
are
right
on,but
the
segment
height
is
2mm
lower
than
I
requested.
While
2
mm
does
not
sound
like
a
lot,
it
places
the
near
vision
part
of
the
trifocal
lens
so
low
in
the
frame
that
it
is
hard
to
use.
My
new
glasses
are
a
great
value.
The
frame
was
just
as
described
and
fits
well.
The
prescription
seems
to
be
accurate.
I'm
happy
with
my
purchase.
Three
days
later
than
originally
scheduled.
Price
turned
out
to
be
average
and
not
necessarily
best.
To
be
fair
the
staff
did
phone
me
each
day
to
update.
no
doubt
this
is
the
cheapest
sight.

off

Did
what
it

what
else
do
you
want,
and
at
a
good
price.
An
outstanding
assortment
of

with
the
best
pricing
on
the
web,
they
will
beat
a

5%.
The

You

I
have
purchased

from

on

occasion
the

I've

Without

Always
what
I
expect
from

I
had
not
heard
of
Avas
Flowers
before
but
I
decided
to
give
them
a
try.

They
had
a
great
selection,
good
prices,
a
website
that
is
easy
to
use,
and
they
delivered
when
promised,
which
was
quicker
than
other
companies
were
promising.

There's
nothing
not
to
like
about
Avas
and
I
would
gladly
use
them
again.
I
was
really
impressed
with
the
service
from
PartsGeek.

They
had
the
best
price
for
the
part
I
wanted,
the
shipping
was
more
than
reasonable,
and
I
had
the
part
in
3
days.
I
will
definately
shop

again!
Found
their

and
was
very
clear
to

Their

If
I

nature
in

I
will
click

on

B&H
is
always
my
first,
and
usually
my
last,
stop
for
electronics.
The
prices
beat
everyone
in
the
area
(northern

and
the
delivery
is
always
within
days.
We
also
enjoy
the

I
"produced"
my
first
photo
book
over
Christmas
and
was
delighted
with
how
easy
it
was
to
do
-
I'm
retired
and
not
very
techno
savvy
but
I
soon
got
the
hang
of
the
system.
The
above
says
it
all.
I
have
been
working
with
the
team
at
Straker
over
the
last
2-3
months
and
feel
I
have
got
to
know
them
personnally.They
offer
a
very
good,
friendly
service.
Their
translation
is
very
accurate
and
quick.
The
company
offers
a
very
excellent
professional
service
to
its
customers.
I
would
recomend
them
to
anyone
10
out
of
10.
I
have
been
a
customer
since
Sept
2013
and
In
Jan
2014
I
was
mailed
a
letter
stating
that
my
rate
would
go
up
$10.00
per
month.

When
I
called
and
asked
The
guy
told
me
I
had
been
with
them
for
a
while
now
and
contract
states
they
can
raise
my
rent
at
anytime
with
30days
notice.

A
long
time?
4
months?
Really?
They
guy
was
rude
and
when
asked
how
much
noticed
I
needed
to
give
to
move
out
he
said,
2
days...
"
I
can
take
the
notice
right
now,
do
you
want
to
give
2
day
notice"
He
said.
WOW.
I
guess
they
don't
care
about
keeping
customers.

They
know
its
not
easy
to
just
pack
up
and
move
so
They
raise
rent
when
they
feel
like
it..
I
did
not
come
in
on
an
introductory
special
for
6
months
or
a
year,,,
I
assumed
that
would
be
the
price
for
at
least
a
yr.

Not
very
happy
with
This
Roseville
location
and
the
attitude
of
the
front
desk
person.
I
ordered
two
steel
maces

The
girl
who
took
my
order
was
awesome.
I
got
them
in
the
mail
within
a
couple
of
days.
Did
some
of
the

from

Decided
to
order
there

tape.
Called

Got
another
awesome

arrived
two
days
later.
I
have
done
the

twice
now.
All
the

on
the
DVD
straight
through,
no
rest!
What
a
Great
workout.
Looking
forward
to
order
the
twenty
pound
Mace
soon.
By
the
way,
I
wasn't
sure
if
it
was
challenging
all
the
muscle
groups.
When
I
got
up
the
next
day
pretty
much
every
muscle
was
sore.
In
a
great
way..
Rhonda
the
manager
at
Eola
Storage
Mart
has
always
taken
very
good
care
of
me.
Their
prices
are
very
reasonable
for
the
area.
I
had
some
damage
to
one
of
my
vehicles
that
was
parked
there
and
she
made
sure
to
take
pictures
and
get
me
in
touch
with
the
right
people.
I
had
a
vehicle
there
that
another
tenant
was
interested
in
purchasing
and
she
connected
us
so
we
could
make
a
deal.
Great
experience
as
far
as
I'm
concerned.
Location
is
very
convenient
and
easy
to
access.They
go
above
and
beyond
to
make
sure
you
have
a
good

We
have
had
good,

great

BUT
IT

They
sent
a
courteous
and
knowledgeable
repair
person
who
arrived
on
time
as
scheduled.

He
diagnosed
the
trouble
with
our
5-7
yr
old
Maytag
dishwasher
as
a
failure
of
the
pumpout
assembly.

His
estimate
ran
about
$438.

I
priced
the
price
of
the
assembly
at
$60
which
left
an
incredible
$378
for
labor.

I
don't
think
they
really
wanted
the
job
as
I
can
buy
brand
new
dishwashers
for
about
1/2
this
overall
cost.
Difficult
to
find
fault.
Good
value
and
very
efficient

I

fine

unlike
what
you
find
in

plus
you
are
not

to
purchase
a
whole
box
of

when
you
only
need
a
few,
this
is
a
big
plus
for
me.

The

of
the

was
great.
They

them.
Thank
you.
I
have
purchased
multiple
times
from

items
have
always
arrived
fast
and
were
exactly
as
ordered.
This
time
I
had
a
problem
with
using
a
coupon.
I
informed
PF
with
my
order...they
never
responded
and
didn't
apply
coupon.
I
will
give
them
a
chance
because
of
prior
experience
but
this
is
not
good
business.
Clubs

picked

Great

I'll
search

Why
don't
I
jyst
remember
that
and
start
(and
end)
my
search
with
b&h?
Maybe
I
will
now.

Good

I

Well
recomemended.
I
needed
magnets
to
evaluate
my
patent.

A
selection
was
delivered
exactly
to
schedule
and
I
had
working
prototypes
in
no
time.

It's
easy
now
for
me
(Spurges.com)

to
specify
exact
requirements
and
have
confidence
that
First4magnets
can
supply.
Glasses
sent
with
one
nosepad
missing
so
no
use.

Still
waiting
for
replacement.
I
see
no
reason
they
couldn't
have
sent
a
new
one
right
away..
Ordered
first
order
with
slight
reservation
due
to
me
living
in
the
north
of
Scotland
and
the
meat
having
so
far
to
travel
but
when
the
order
arrived
it
was
very
well
packed
and
chilled
and
in
very
good
time.
Meat
was
straight
in
the
freezer
until
first
day
of
cooking.
So
far
ive
had
the
Chicken,Veal,Hache
steaks
and
the
mince.
All
were
top
quality
with
the
mince
getting
particular
high
marks
when
girlfriend
cooked
it
as
she
never
had
to
at
any
point
drain
out
any
fat
unlike
supermarket
one,s.
I
will
be
looking
to
order
again
for
sure
and
if
the
product
is
of
similar
quality
then
it
could
be
a
lifetime
choice
of
meat
shopping.
Once
again
the
Stress
Free
Parking
-Meet
and
Greet
has
been
moved
.
Every
time
we
use
this
very
good
service
it
has
been
moved
to
a
different
parking
area
at
Luton
Airport,
and
every
time
it
is
further
away
with
no
help
to
get
to
the
departure
area.
Do
you
know,
I
get
out
of
breath
very
quickly
and
walking
is
also
a
problem
so
the
extra
amount
of
walking
leaves
me
very
breathless.
We
chose
Stress
free
Parking
because
when
we
first
used
it,
it
was
near
the
Airport
buildings
now
it
is
much
further
away.
Oil
pressure
sensor
went
in
easy
and
works
well.
So
after
looking
at
other
online
sites
that
claim
to
have
the
best
prices,
SupplementWarehouse.com
actually
DOES.
Not
only
are
their
prices
the
lowest,
they
will
beat
the
competition
by
5%
if
it
is
cheaper
elsewhere!
Super
easy
to
navigate
the
site
and
very
pleased
with
the
selection.
We
found
our
new
site
to
order
from
when
it
comes
to
great
deals
on
supps.
I
wanted
a
new
BBQ
cover
and
found
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for
on
the
Garden
XL
web
site.
Compared
to
other
sites
the
price
was
excellent
and
I
had
no
hesitation
in
placing
the
order.
Delivery
was
very
quick
and
the
cover
was
perfect.
It's
the
type
of
service
you
should
expect
-
no
messing
about,
on
time

and
a
coffee
ready
on
arrival!
Had
some
issues
completing
the
order
due
to
technical
malfunctions.
But
customer
care
was
helpful
locating
the
payment
and
completing
the
order.
I
like
your
web
site
it
ise
easy
to
use,
we
can
many
accomodation
it
is
so
nice
to
get
choice
and
quickly.
I
have
ordered
a
few
parts
already
from
parts
geek.
And
I
must
say
totally
happy
so
far
with
service
and
ease
of
use
of
the
site.
It's
a
problem
to
get
on
or
it
shuts
me
out.
Then
I
have
to
call
the
1-800
#
to
get
help,
which

turns
into
a
20
minute
conversation-
not
could
when
your
a

busy
business
owner.
These
guys
have
all
kinds
of
odd
ball
stuff
I
can't
find
anywhere
else
for
my
86
Porsche
944!
Lots
of
OEM
parts
included
for
a
lot
cheaper
than
the
dealer!
Great
site
and
service
is
exceptional!
I
would
never
use
PARTS
GEEK
again,
I
order
a
flywheel
and
clutch
kit
assembly
and
only
received
the
flywheel.
The
box
that
both
were
sap
post
to
be
in
was
destroyed
when
I
received
it.
The
box
was
about
3-4
time
bigger
then
it
should
have
been
for
the
two
parts
that
was
ordered.
Still
waiting
on
if
I’ll
ever
see
the
other
parts
I
ordered,
but
as
of
now
I
haven’t
seen
the
clutch
kit
assembly.
I
turned
this
issue
over
to
my
credit
card
company
and
they
are
going
to
fight
for
me.
I
ordered
three
Galaxy
S3
power
switches,
and
they
arrived
from
overseas
in
under
10
days.
This
pleased
me
greatly.
Ordered
Range
Rover
parts,
paid
a-lot
less
than
i
expected
and
received
them
lightning
fast!!
I
am
very
unhappy
with
my
first
experience
with
Parts
Geek.

I
purchased
several
items
on
2/17/14.

They
finally
shipped
out
on
2/21/2014.

I
received
one
package
with
one
of
the
parts
in
it
pretty
quick
after
2/21.

The
other
package
has
YET
to
get
here!!!

Today
is
2/28!!!!

I
could
have
WALKED
to
the
local
parts
store
that
is
20
miles
away
and
WALKED
home
faster
than
this!!!!

I
am
VERY
disappointed
and
will
not
ever
use
this
company
again.

I
bought
a
96
F250
in
need
of
a
lot
of
work
and
planned
on
buying
many
of
the
parts
I
need
from
here
and
tested
the
waters
with
my
first
purchase.

FAIL!

MAJOR
FAIL!!
I
love
these
people
and
their
products.
I
ordered
top
secret
nutrition's
100%
whey
and
received
a
free
thing
of
astravar.
Also
there
are
alot
of
free
gifts
that
you
can
pick
up
if
you
want
to
which
is
awesome.
the
only
problem
is
that
the
shipping
was
13
dollars
and
only
got
more
expensive
with
the
free
items
you
choose.
If
you
need
the
item
that
is
free
then
the
slight
increase
in
shipping
is
well
worth
it
though.
Overall,
I
think
if
you
find
one
of
the
deals
(like
free
astravar)
it
is
well
worth
it.
But
if
the
price
of
the
product
is
only
a
little
bit
cheaper
than
another
site
and
they
have
free
shipping
then
it
is
probably
a
better
bet.
I
am
going
to
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
of
the
deals
and
I
can
almost
guaruntee
I
will
be
shopping
here
again
World
Rugby
Shop
is
a
sham.
Hidden
charges
everywhere.
They
deliver
outside
the
U.S
through
an
external
company
who
charge
much
more
than
you
agree
for
delivery.
Also,
the
import
duties
for
deliveries
to
addresses
outside
the
U.S
are
ridiculous.
You
think
its
a
bargain
but
its
not.
Stay
away!
Shipping
charge
confusion.
Didn't
realize
I
had
to
pay
2
shipping
costs
for
2
items
from
2
different
warehouses.....
Thought
it
was
1
transaction!
You
need
to
totally
buy
your
books
from
Bookbyte.
They
have
awesome
prices,
with
quick
and
easy
shipping.
Their
books
show
up
in
the
condition
they
are
advertised
in.
never
heard
of
this
company
but
came
across
it
while
searching
for
pats
for
my
Volvo
850.
Easy
to
navigate
through
inventory.
Got
the
correct
part
delivered
to
my
house
in
two
days
with
free
ground
shipping.
I'll
be
back.
Received
the
part
I
ordered
at
a
great
price..
especially
since
I
own
a
Cadillac
'n
the
'stealership'
parts
prices
are
a
'bit'
overpriced.
I
will
use
partsgeek.com
again.
I
just
love
B&H
Photo.
Always
have
competitive
prices,
delivery
when
they
say
(or
earlier).
Site
is
easy
to
use.

Couldn't
be
better.
Highly
recommended
really
quick
good
Tyres
*****
I
regularly
buy
from
B&H
because
they
have
the
best
products,
prices,
service
&
shipping.
The
Best.
I
could
not
believe
how
quickly
this
product
was
delivered,
it
was
packaged
properly
and
probably
the
quickest
delivery

I
have
ever
received.
The
people
were
helpful,
and
the
website
is
easy
to
use.
Really
can't
fault
TransferWise.
I've
transferred
a
number
of
currencies
with
them
and
the
processing
time
is
consistently
impressive.
The
rates
after
rebate
are
unheard
of-
and
if
the
rebate
process
puts
you
off,
the
turnaround
time
for
receipt
is
very
quick.
I
was
surprised
how
quick
and
accurate
the
transcription
was.
This
isn't
a
service
I
will
use
very
often.
But
if
I
did
need
it
again
or
someone
asked
for
my
recommendation
rev
would
be
my
first
suggestion.
Not
only
do
they
beat
every
competitors
price
but
everything
you
buy
ships
quick
and
cheap.

So
glad
I
was
able
to
find
a
great
selection
with
very
low
prices.
The
product
was
a
perfect
fit
and
it
works
great.
Travelling
to
catch
a
flight
is
stressful,
particularly
when
your
route
is
the
M4
into
London.

Faced
with
an
accident
at
J6
causing
an
hour
delay,
the
response
and
attention
from
the
Skypark
operator
was
top
notch.

Double
checking
flight
details
and
timing,
advising
of
possible
alternative
routes
and
timing
and
greart
directions
to
the
pickup
point.

Result
was
minimal
delay
on
arrival
and
able
to
catch
an
intercontinental
flight
-
stress
level
dropped
immediately.
Most
online
shopping
with
free
delivery
means
you'll
have
to
be
hanging
around
all
day.
Ukmail

Very
impressive!
Got
a
great
price
on
a
bike
stand.
It
was
dispatched
swiftly
and
emails
kept
me
up
to

with
the
order
process...what
more
could
I
hope
for!
I

Would

I

The

was
excellent

and
a
great

Bought

Lenstore
is
the
best
online
retailer
I
have
dealt
with
in
my
life
-even
better
when
I
have
had
to
call
them,
it
has
been
easy
to
get
to
a
real
person
in
no
time
at
all.
The
staff
is
friendly
and
professional.
Deliveries
arrive
ahead
of

and
the
pricing
is
excellent.
Body
damage
to
my
vehicle
scared
me
because
I
never
know
how
expensive
the
replacement
part
is
going
to
be.
While
I
hoped
a
new
side
mirror
was
only
going
to
be
in
the
$50
range,
I
was
prepared
to
find
that
it
was
a
$200
item.
Had
I
gone
to
a
dealer
for
an
OEM
mirror,
I'm
sure
I
would
have
paid
that
much,
but
I
was
thrilled
to
buy
what
I
needed
from
partsgeek
for
only
$50,
and
I
had
it
on
my
doorstep
in
less
than
a
week!
I
reccomend
AGS
period!!!
I
will
be
ordering
my

from

in
a

after

FedEx

send
a

Unless
I
buy

I

CJS
CD
Keys
where
the
easiest,
quickest
and
cheapest
website
I've
ever
used
to
purchase
and
redeem
a
game,
would
recommend
it
to
anyone.
If
you've
never
been
to
London,
here's
the
perfect
way
to
see
all
of
the
popular
sites
to
see.

We
purchased
a
two
day
pass
so
we
could
take
our
time
and
see
as
many
sites
as
possible
in
a
slower
paced
setting.

Big
Bus
Tours
were
awesome.

If
you
wanted
to
see
a
specific
place,
just
hop
off,
go
visit,
then
hop
back
on
when
you're
ready
to
go
see
another
site.

We
liked
the
"red"
tour
bus
because
you
have
a
live
person
giving
you
information
about
the
city
and
it's
famous
spots.

It
made
it
more
personable
than
the
"blue"
tour
where
you
get
headsets
to
listen
to.

Both
were
great,
but
we
enjoyed
the
"red"
tour
better.

Had
a
great
time!

Will
definitely
us
them
again
to
get
around
the
city.
Pay

Crutchfield
delivered
exactly
what
they
promised.
Great
service.
Have
been
using
Amazon
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
the
web
site
was
easy
to
navigate,
prices
were
excellent
and
the
delivery
arrived
as
promised.
Setting
up
the
automatic
delivery
schedule
was
a
breeze.
Could
not
be
more
pleased
with
the
VIP
Calling
Plan
for
Ghana.

The
simplicity
is
remarkable,
plus
having
10
Speed
Dial
numbers
that
take
you
directly
to
your
friends
and
family
is
fantastic.

It
makes
the
calls
from
your
friends
and
family
easier
and
less
expensive
for
them,
having
a
local
number
they
can
call.

Every
one
has
been
pleased
with
your
plan.

We
all
sincerely
thank
you
and
my
friends
and
family
is
telling
everyone
about
your
plan,
and
look
to
bring
more
customers
to
VIP
Communications.
I
purchased
a
warranty
for
my
high-end
appliance
almost
five
years
ago.

With
about
six
months
left
on
the
warranty
the
freezer
started
giving
me
problems.

I
called
Squaretrade
and
after
a
quick
evaluation
on
the
phone
their
appliance
tech
said
that
he
would
schedule
a
repairman
to
visit.

Living
in
a
small
town,
there
were
three
different
repairmen

scheduled
to
come
to
the
house
over
the
course
of
almost
a
month
and
none
of
them
showed.

After
contacting
their
resolution
manager
I
was
paid
out
in
full
on
the
claim
so
that
I
could
purchase
a
new
appliance.

What
started
out
as
a
disastrous
situation
turned
out
perfect
and
I
was
refunded
in
full
for
the
price
of
both
my
warranty
and
the
original
purchase
price
of
the
appliance.
The
best
price,
security
and
delivery
time
as
promised.
Highly
recommended
The
reservation
process
was
fine.

The
problem
is
that
they
charged
me
for
my
stay
19
DAYS
BEFORE
I
WAS
TO
ARRIVE.



The
did
not
tell
me
that
I
was
going
to
be
charged
now
and
not
when
I
utilize
the
reservation
like
normal
businesses
do,
Now
my
credit
card
expects
me
to
pay
for
the
reservation
before
I
have
even
used
it.
This
is
not
right.

And
your
reservation
company
in
the
Phillipians
has
only
canned
answers
when
you
ask
questions.

I
WILL
NEVER
USE
THEM
AGAIN.

And
if
I
have
any
problems
at
the
Ramada
Inn
where
the
reservation
is
made
for
I
will
never
use
Ramada
Inn
again.
Very
easy
to
deal
with.
Very
happy
with
the
products.
You

Vital
Choice
it
is
the
foundation
of
my
health.
I
had
a
wounderful
every
one
was
very
polite
and
professional.
I
had
all
the
information
and
it
was
very
quick.
Have
ordered
many
things
from
them
-
love
the
company.
Much
cheaper
than
buying
from
the
gym!!
This
organization
is
great.
Large
selection
and
extremely
fast
shipping.
Went
online
to
get
an
idea
of
costs
for
a
week
at
Gatwick
and
was
surprised
and
pleased
at
the
good
value
on
offer.
Chose
the
Ace
Meet
and
Greet
and
the
booking
went
through
quickly
and
efficiently.
I
love
amazon.
No
complains
at
ALL
!
The
service
was
wonderful.
I
saw
a
guy
on
TV
at
The
Sex
Pistols
live
concert
wearing
a
Harrington
jacket
and
thought
"
I
got
to
get
one
!
"


So
30
years
on
I
just
bought
my
second
Harrington
.

Quality
!
One
google
search
for
the
supplement
I
wanted
and
I
was
directed
to
supplementwarehouse
and
found
the
cheapest
prices
yet
and
a
whole
list
of
options
for
the
supplements
I
was
looking
for.
Got
exactly
what
I
wanted
fast
and
didn't
break
the
bank.
I
have
ordered
from
Selectspecs
several
times
now.
All
the
products
I
have
received
have
met
or
exceeded
my
expectations.

For
budget
minded
buyers
they
provide
a
fantastic
alternative
to
buying
from
expensive
brick
and
mortar
stores
or
questionable
online
sellers.

Shipping
is
secure
and
arrives
within
a
very
reasonable
amount
of
time.

My
prescription
matches
up
correctly
and
the
workmanship
is
quality.
This
is
how
it
should
be
done.
Bought
the
string
light
starter
kit.
They
were
perfect
lighting
for
the
dance
floor
during
wedding
in
our
back
yard.
I
would
suggest
them
to
anyone.
I
have
been
doing
business
with
B&H
for
over
10
years.

Only
had
one
problem
which
was
fixed.

I
will
keep
doing
ALL
my
photo
/
video
business
with
them.
That´s
really
one
of
the
most
awful
shops
I
even
bought
an
item.
The
wakemate
was
broken
when
it
arrived
in
Europe
so
I
tried
to
get
in
contact
with
these
guys
-
no
answer.
After
two
weeks
they
answered
and
told
me
to
send
the
wakemate
back.
On
my
own
expenses!!!
I
did
it
as
I
wanted
my
money
back.
BTW
-
The
quality
is
so
bad
of
this
product!
Nevertheless
they
never
replied
to
my
emails
asking
for
refund.

I
ordered
two
suits
-
both
were
of
excellent
quality.
Nevertheless
my
tailor
had
to
make
some
adjustments
on

because
of
missing
liner
tapes.
Bad:
You
could
not
choose
the

too

DHL
does
not
ring

if

when
they

you
have
to
go

your

I
found
WebAnnuities
on
an
internet
search
while
exploring
my
options
for
converting
an
IRA
to
an
immediate
annuity
for
retirement.

Naturally,
I
was
cautious,
but
it
turns
out
my
financial
advisor
had
done
business
with
them
himself,
so
I
was
reassured.

I
made
several
phone
calls
to
them
over
a
period
of
some
weeks,
and
asked
for
projections
of
I
don't
know
how
many
scenarios
as
I
carefully
weighed
all
the
options.

The
people
at
WebAnnuities
were
always
very
responsive,
articulate,
and
most
of
all,
patient
with
me.

Once
I
made
my
decision,
they
continued
to
be
very
attentive,
helping
me
to
work
through
some
issues
in
closing
out
my
IRA
to
make
the
transfer.

Even
after
the
annuity
was
established,
they
followed
up
to
make
sure
everything
had
started
okay.

I
have
nothing
but
praise
for
these
folks!
Quick
and
reliable.
Never
had
any
problems.
Power

Keeps
me

I
especially
like

trade-in
policy.

The
service
is
fast
and
no
hassles
and
since
I
keep
my
original
box
the
return
is
easy.
Entire
process
was
smooth
and
painless.

Only
improvement
would
be
to
offer
more
color
options.
My
company
needed
a
spare
part
urgently
which
wasn't
available
at
a
sensible
price
via
our
normal
distributors.


Ordered
on
EBay
without
really
investigating
Lambda
Tek,
and
the
component
arrived
the
next
day.


Was
kept
updated
by
email
with
tracking
info,
and
a
follow
up
email
to
confirm
I
had
received
goods.


Will
definitely
order
directly
from
Lambda
Tek
again
in
the

Excellent

and
keenly

product.
I
often
require

I

I
ordered
2
small
items
from
Parts
Geek.
Because
THEY
shipped
them
from
2
different
places,
they
charged
me
twice
for
shipping
and
handling.
One
of
the
parts
they
shipped
me
was
the
wrong
part
(it
was
labeled
correctly
on
the
package,
but
was
the
right
hand
piece
instead
of
the
left
hand.)
I
notified
customer
service
immediately
over
a
week
ago
and
all
I
get
are
endless
e-mails
that
say
that
they
are
approving
my
return
and
will
send
me
an
"RMA
e-mail"
with
return
instructions-
an
e-mail
that
has
yet
to
arrive.
So,
not
only
did
they
only
get
50%
of
my
initial
order
correct
(yes
I
double
checked
my
order-the
mistake
was
NOT
mine),
they
have
so
far
failed
to
correct
their
error.
I
bought
an
item
from
Cash
Generator
on
the
website....
it
arrived
and
the

would
not
let
me
register
it.
I
contacted
the
store
and
they
advised
the
would
contact
the
original
seller
to
try
and
resolve
this...
i
never
heard
from
them
again.
In
total
i
sent
another
3
emails
after
this
with
no
response.
I
have
tried

Very

Following
some
intensive
web
searching
and
testimonial
reading
we
still
had
a
couple
of
questions.
A
phone
call
soon
had
these
efficiently
answered
if
a
friendly
way
with
no
pressure.

After
further
discussion
we
cplaced
an
order,
via
the
website,
for
a
19"
model
for
our
caravan.
Having
selected
the
free
delivery
option
we
were
delighted
to
recieve
it
within
48
hours.
It
is
now
installed
and
giving
great
reception
and
picture
quality.
Great
service,
price,
and
lead
time.
Seamless
process.
I
needed
a
translation
service
for
paperwork
processing
and
Rev.com
performed
a
quick,
reliable
service.
I
was
short
on
my
rent
because
of
so
many
graduations,
proms
and

in
one

I
decided
that
we
needed
extra

fast!
Quickercash.com

Thanks

Very
good
first
time
buying
experience
from
Merlin
Cycles.
The
items
I
needed
were
in
stock
and
came
to
me
nicely
packaged
and
in
a
very
reasonable
ammount
of
time.
I
live
in
the
USA
and
Merlin
made
the
process
very
easy.
I
would
definitely
buy
from
again.
Your
website
reminds
me
of
the
old
"bait
and
switch"
scams.
You
can't
beat
the
way
Town
Fair
Tire
backs
up
their
products.
I
had
my
winter
all
terrains
switched
over
for
my
summer
road
tires
today
for
42
bucks
with
an
alignment
check
and
balancing.
My
only
critique
was
that
they
estimated
it
to
take
1hr.
to
1hr.
20mins
and
I
was
there
for
around
2hrs.
My
parts
were
easy
to
find..
well
priced
and
delivered
quick..
two
thumbs
up!
I
ordered
a
birthday
present
for
my
brother
which
was
something
a
little
different
from
buying
Irish
Whisky
at
the
Supermarket,
but
still
reasonably
priced.
The
website
was
easy
to
follow
and
delivery
was
very
prompt.
Overall
excellent
service.
I
wonder
if
the
Oakley
paperclip
frame
comes
in
a
slightly
larger
size
and
it
is
would
be
possible
to
exchange
them
to
get
a
more
nearly
comfortable
fit.
I
chatted
with
Oliver
online
and
he
was
exceptionally
helpful
and
courteous.
He
knew
where
to
send
me
to
solve
my
problem
without
me
having
all
the
info
to
make
his
job
easier.
Kudos!!!
Expansive
selection,
good
prices
and
fast
shipping.
I
ordered
Razorock
Don
Marco
Famiglia
Shaving
soap
on
a
Thursday
and
received
it
on
Saturday.
This
was
from
California
to
Iowa
in
two
days!
In
addition
to
the
amazing
turnaround,
Royal
Shave
was
the
only
place
I
could
find
this
particular
shaving
soap
in-stock
and
at
a
great
price.
I
recommend
Royal
Shave
to
everyone
without
reservation.
The
items
came
quickly
and
were
exactly
what
I
ordered.
Very
timely.

Thanks
You
guys
rock
easy
and

I
was
able
to
pick
up
my
car
in
another
location
with
no
problems
whatsoever.
This
is
my
second
time
renting
with
auto
europe
and

I
will
look
first
into
renting
a
car
in
Europe.
The
service
from
Diabloskinz
is
simply
fantastic,
clearly
a
very
dedicated
and
professional
bunch.
James
in
particular
has
always
been
extremely
friendly
and
very
helpful.
The
ISFJ
has
an
extremely
well-developed
sense
of
space,
function,
and
aesthetic
appeal.
For
that
reason,
they're
likely
to
have
beautifully
furnished,
functional
homes.
They
make
extremely
good
interior
decorators.
This
special
ability,
combined
with
their
sensitivity
to
other's
feelings
and
desires,
makes
them
very
likely
to
be
great
gift-givers
-
finding
the
right
gift
which
will
be
truly
appreciated
by
the
recipient.
This
is
no
gimmicks
I
am
so
happy
I
found
this
website
I
wish
I
had
found
this
website
way
way
for
before
this
is
the
s***
There
is
no
doubt
that
after
reading
many
stories
and
pages
on
the
SCAM
of
selling
titles
that
its
legitimacy
is
highly
questionable.

But
do
I
intend
to
leverage
my
title
for
profit
or
gain?

No.

Do
I
intend
to
try
and
build
a
condominium
on
my
plot?

No.

Do
I
intent
to
trek
to
Scotland
to
stand
on
my
plot
in
my
heritage
kilt
and
pump
a
tune
through
my
newly
acquired
bag
pipes?

Definately
no.

But
the
endevour
with
a
title
certificate
and
the
cuff
links
-
its
a
bit
of
quirky
fun
and
a
great
talking
point
with
friends
and
family.

Too
many
things
in
life
are
so
serious
and
over
governed
and
the
struggles
from
day
to
day
to
put
food
on
the
table
takes
its
toll.

This
is
fun,
quirky,
interesting
and
something
to
bring
back
a
sense
of
humour
and
a
smile
to
peoples
faces.
I
really
did
find
it
easy
to
organize
my
trip
to
Amsterdam.
Went
straight
to
KLM
site
for
flights
and
it
all
went
smooth.
Then
I
did
shop
around
for
hotels.
Wanted
something
very
central
as
though
I'm
only
there
for
4
days
with
the
kids.
I
found
plenty
of
hotels,
actually
spoilt
for
choice.
Then
checked
out
a
few
sites
for
booking
a
hotel.
And
I
must
say
easytobook
was
really
just
as
it
says
"
easy
to
book
"!!
I
wouldn't
hesitate
using
them
again
and
recommending
them
to
friends
and
family.
Check
availability
before
ordering
online.
I
ordered
a
TV
advertised
online
on
their
website.
It
was
being
discontinued,
I
got
a
phone
call
to
say
Samsung
had
no
stock
left,
The
sales
person
then
tried
very
had
to
sell
a
different
model,
not
what
I
expected
or
wanted.
Very
easy
way
to
buy
travel
insurance
if
you
are
over
a
certain
age.
I
wanted
to
pick
up
an
'Ultimate
Game
Card'
to
get
some
'Zen'
for
Star
Trek
Online.
Imagine
my
delight
when
I
saw
them
on
PC
Game
Supply,
not
only
for
instant
delivery,
but
10%
off
as
well!
I
input
my
information
to
purchase
a
single
card
for
18.00
US.
The
site
was
quite
slow
to
process...
and
when
I
recieved
my
reciept,
I
had
been
charged
for
2
cards
for
a
total
of
36
dollars!
I
immediately
emailed
customer
service
to
explain
that
I
had
been
charged
in
error,
and
only
wanted
one
card.
I
recieved
a
rather
curt
and
terse
reply,
that
said
"Look
again,
you
bought
2
cards."
That
was
it.
No
offer
or
willingness
to
assist,
simply
a
one
sentence
reply
telling
me
that
I
was
wrong
and
implied
it
was
my
fault,
so
deal
with
it.
Reviewing
the
site's
refund
policy,
I
saw
that
if
I
had
not
looked
at
the
codes
(I
hadn't)
I
could
request
a
refund
and
would
be
given
one
with
no
trouble.
I
wrote
back,
again
indicating
that
as
I
had
said,
I
only
wanted
a
single
card,
and
a
refund
for
the
second
one.
I
recieved
a
reply
that
my
request
would
be
forwarded
to
management.
The
next
day,
I
recieved
another
email
indicating
that
my
credit
card
had
only
been
'pre-authorized'
and
I
had
not
been
charged
at
all.
This
was
untrue,
according
to
my
bank's
website.
I
then
recieved
another
email
stating
that
I
had
been
issued
a
refund
for
both
cards
(Despite
that
not
being
what
I
asked
for.)
To
get
clarification
to
this
whole
mess,
I
used
their
site
link
to
their
live
chat
support
-
which
doesn't
exist,
apparently.
I
find
the
customer
service
number
and
call.
I
was
placed
on
hold
(fairly
standard)
and
assured
it
would
be
a
few
minutes
at
most.
Aproximately
1
minute
later,
my
call
was
kicked
to
voice
mail.
It
said
to
leave
a
name
and
number,
which
I
did
along
with
my
account
email.
My
call,
to
date,
has
still
not
been
returned.
I've
been
looking
at
a
Meade
refractor
telescope
for
months.
I
finally
decided
to
buy
one
and
found
the
absolute
lowest
price
with
free
shipping
on
B&H.
Very
pleased
with
that.
I've
also
dealt
with
them
before
for
photographic
equipment
and
have
always
been
happy
with
them.
I
spent
many
hours
surfing
the
net
for
my
appliance
requirements,that
is,
Simple
and
fast.
Great
website,
easy
to
navigate
and
parts
were
correct
for
my
vehicle.

Shipping
was
slow
but
free
so
not
much
room
for
complaint.

Not
that
I'm
looking
forward
to
my
next
break
down
but
when
it
does
happen
I
will
be
getting
my
parts
from
PartsGeek!
...let
down
by
courier
leaving
the
parcel
with
a
neighbour
but
not
leaving
us
a
card
to
say
so.
This
sat
with
the
neighbour
for
three
days
who
thought
we
couldn't
be
bothered
to
collect
it,
when
we
didn't
know
it
had
been
delivered.
Bonne
communication.
Commande
conforme.
Great
Prices
and
Great
service!
Exact
part,
Quick
Delivery!
Right
on
time!
Plain
and
simple
process.
Communication
at
its
best.
I
ordered
the
labels
for
a
CD
so
that
I
could
use
them
for
a
clients
wedding
images.

The
CD
labels
came
very
quick
BUT
the
image
was
beyond
pixelated
and
pretty
embarrassing
to
have
to
give
to
a
paying
client.

Unfortunately
time
constraint
required
I
had
too.

I
know
I
uploaded
a
high
resolution
image
to
the
site
to
be
printed
so
I
am
still
a
little
questionable
if
I
will
come
back
again
based
on
the
pixelation
in
the
final
copies
I
was
provided.
We
had
trouble
making
the
final
purchase
on
line;
had
great
service
on
the
telephone.
I
had
placed
my
order
and
receivedo
it
in
a
timely
manner
and
also
at
a
very
affordable
price!
I
will
be
shopping
with
this
company
for
now
on!
Would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
More
Handles
and
will
use
them
again

The

are
great,
I

Many

didn't
have
the

that
I
needed
as
soon
as
possible.

with

Parcels.
All
packages
delviered
successfully

from

which
went
missing

due
to
a
mistake
by

Have
been
compensated
for
this
and
am
contung
to
use
NI

for
my

I
very
much
appreciated
the
service
I
received.

The
part
I
ordered
was
in
stock
and
was
shipped
the
very
next
day
-
and
I
received
it
the
day
after.

What
a
great
on-line
shopping
experience
and
I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
I
have
dealt
with
B&H
for
a
number
of
years
and
as
usual,
it
has
been
a
great
experience.
In
an
age
of
Ho-Hum
attitudes
from
salespeople
it
is
ALWAYS
good
to
hear
a
B&H
voice
and
experience
the
ease
of
ordering
online.

placed
an
order
for

I

I
called
regarding
an
alert
I
received
and
the
representative
that
I
spoke
to
took
my

put
me
on

After
holding
for
20
minutes
without
him
coming
back

let
me
know
the

I
decided
to

that

was

Could
not
identify
the
part
I
required
in
the
parts
section
but
and
e-mail
to

Doc
had
the
part
quickly
identified,
ordered
and
worked
a
treat.
I've
always
been
a
skeptic
from
the
get
go
when
it
comes
to
trying
new
products.

After
listening
to
a
hundred
podcasts
on
the
JRE
I
thought
that
I
should
try
Alpha

I
don't
know
how
much
psychological
play
is
afoot,
but
I
have
observed
real
objective
growth
in
the
last
2
weeks.

My
wife
has
also
been
using
NEW
MOOD
and
has
directed
me
to
buy
the
larger
count
bottle
asap.
I
normally
don't
write
too
many
reviews,
but
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
of
the
parts
and
the
speed
at
which
they
arrived.

I
am
the
proud
owner
of
a
1991
VW
GTI
which
I
have
only
owned
for
about
a
month.

The
previous
owner
replaced
the
manual
windows
with
some
OEM

windows
that
worked
well
until

of

cables
became
frayed
and
wouldn't
roll
all
the

up.

I
did

and

showed
as
having
the

I
needed.

I
checked
a
few
other
sites,
but
I
felt
PartsGeek
was
a
more
reputable
company
so
I
ordered
from
them.

The
parts
came
really
fast.

I
had
never
done
a
window
regulator
before,
but
I
am
no
stranger
to
working
on
cars.

I
had
the
old
one
out
in
about
five
minutes
after
removing
the
door
panel.

Right
away,
I
noticed
the
improvement
the
new
window
regulator
had
over
the
old
one.

Installation
was
seamless
and
I
couldn't
be
happier.

The
new
unit
was
leaps
and
bounds
above
the
OEM
unit.

Huge
thanks
to
PartsGeek
for
all
of
their
help.
Once
product
was
in
stock
the
delivery
process
was
one
of
the
best
I
have
encountered.Was
told
every
step
of
the
way
when
my
product
was
going
to
be
delivered
whenever
we
go
abroard
we
always
use
skyparksecure
.Never
had
any
problems
from
booking
on
line,
to
parking
up,
and
then
enjoying
our
holiday
knowing
your
car
is
safe
and
secure.Total
peace
of
mind
.
Good
prices,
always
deals
on
offer,
very
competitive
but
still
top
quality.
Everything
whent
smooth,
except
that
the
colours
that
showed
in
the
website
was
out
of
stock
so
i
was
forced
to
change.
Very
relaxed
atmosphere.

Front-End
alignment
included
with
purchase.

Friendly
staff.

Will
return
for
all
my
tire
needs.

Thanks
My
go
to
for
my
cat
supplies
BikeTiresDirect
offers
great
prices
and
their
loyalty
programs
offers
a
great
incentive
to
continue
to
shop
with
them
for
all
cycling
needs.
My
product
arrived
just
as
I
had
ordered
it
and
was
only
a
few
days
before
it
arrived.
The
price
was
much
better
than
other
places
I
had
looked
online.
Price
was
very
competitive
and
the
product
arrived
in
record
time.
Highly
recommend.
I'm
a
car
guy.
Only
trouble
is
I've
run
out
of
places
to
park
my
"toys".
For
a
little
more
than
$1.00
per
day
I
can
park
my
car
in
Public
Storage's
enclosed,
gated
facility.
I
can
keep
my
car
covered
and
I
know
that
Public
Storage's
staff
makes
frequent
rounds,
on
foot,
to
make
sure
everything
is
alright.
I
also
have
peace
of
mind
that
only
Public
Storage
customers
are
allowed
in
the
facility.
Everyone
must
use
their
personal
gate
code
to
come
in.
This
is
very
reassuring
to
me.
The
facility
is
well
lit
at
night
as
well.
Their
staff
is
very
courteous
and
friendly
too.
I
pay
my
rent
in
person
and
the
office
has
a
homey
"mom
and
pop"
feel
to
it.
I
like
that.
I'd
highly
recommend
Public
Storage
to
Reasonably
priced,
easy,
and
quick
shipment.
I
buy
most
of
my
supply's
hear
and
the
prices
are
the
best
and
no
one
compares
to
there
shipping
its
very
cheap
and
its
1st
class
all
the
way.....
Thank
you
BodyBuilding.com
you
all
Rock!
Amazon
Rocks!
I
buy
most
of
my
shoes
there
and
i
can
honestly
say
there
prices
are
awsome!
I
really
love
to
shop
at
supplement
werehouse,
they
have
great
prices
and
free
gifts...
but
the
shipping
is
a
little
pricey...
more
than
bodybuilding.com.
but
i
still
recomend
them
to
all
my
friends.
I
dig
the
unusual
workout
equipment
you
can't
find
just
anywhere.
I
am
very
happy
with
my
recent
purchase
of
ten
pound
clubbells.
Fast
shipping,
reasonable
price
and
item
was
as
shown.
They
were
right
on,
the
item
came
in
a
timely
fashion
and
was
the
correct
item.
I
had
others
send
the
wrong
piece.
Good
job,
I
will
buy
from
them
again.
As
good
as
always
on
price
&
service
Good
service
and
product
Good
online
service
and
communication.
Quick
and
easy
booking,
just
works!
It's
really
simple
to
get
your
games
here
and
if
you
ever
encounter
some
troubles
you
are
helped
as
quickly
as
possible
by
the
staff
members,
plus
the
prices
are
really
great.
Great
and
friendly
staff
My
order
arrived
quickly
and
I
was
kept
informed
of
progress.
I
ordered
my
new
rucksack
and
it
arrived
very
quickly
and
was
exactly
what
I
expected.
I
order
a
part
from
the
comp.
It
was
wrong
so
I
ask
for
help
Twice
I
was
given
the
wrong
part
number
The
first
time
I
look
up
the
app.
and
question
it
.
I
was
told
the
second
the
time
that
was
it.
So
I
order
it
.On
the
18th
I
received
The
wrong
part
again.So
I
ask
for
a
R.A.
number
Today
Is
the
24th
Still
no
number
Not
only
were
my
ropes
shipped
quickly,
but
they're
friggin
awesome.
I've
had
them
for
about
a
month
now
and
they've
been
used
regularly
and
are
still
in
great
shape.
I
got
the
short
jump
rope
and
a
50
ft
rope.
I
worked
with
a
group
of

guys
training
for
a
spartan
race
and
they
certainly
helped.
I
definitely
recommend
muscle
ropes.
While
trying
to
book
a
ticket
by
phone,
I
waited
through
a
lengthy
phone
tree.
Eventually
a
real
human
at
a
call
station
in
Nicaragua
was
able
to
help
me,
but
her
slow
internet
connection
took
us
30min
to
get
the
ticket.
She
was
very
nice
and
trying
hard.
Always
good
service
and
good
prices
If

people.
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
buying
from
heinnie
on
3
seperate
occasions,
and
all
I
can
says
is
the
services
has
been
fantastic
every

time,
and
they
have
fast
become
my
retailer
of
choice
for
there
vast
array
of
products
and
I
will
most
definatly
be
buying
from
again.
Great
prices,
good

and
fast

As
promised,
got
it
my

I
would
buy

from
the

co
again.
fast

made

At
first
I
was
not
sure
that
one
of
the
five
original
designs
could
end
up
being
my
identity
but
I
was
wrong.
The
Logo
Company
took
the
one
element
that
I
really
liked
and
turned
it
into
an
original
beautiful
logo
that
I
am
proud
of
to
represent
me
and
my
business.
They
were
very
very
patient
(as
I
can
be
pretty
picky)
and
gave
me
as
many
revisions
as
needed
until
it
was
perfect.
Also,
each
revision
came
in
a
very
timely
manner
-
sometimes
even
the
same
day.
I
received
a
very
professional
logo
for
a
very
reasonable
price.
I
would
recommend
them
for
any
start
up
or
small
business
or
to
re-design
a
new
and
exciting
logo
for
an
existing
business.
Thanks
so
much
guys...I'm
on
my
way.
ALTHOUGH
THE

PERFECT,DELIVERED
THE

EVEN
THOUGH
IT

These

you
can
source
things
Worldwide
and
if
a
Company
lets
you
down
then
that
is
it
as
far
as
I
am
concerned.
I
have
never
had
any
issues
with
Heinnie
Haynes
and
thier
speed
of
delivery,
communication
regarding
the
processing
of
my
order
and
their
website/catalogues
are
well
presented
and
a
joy
to
view.
Got
my
parts
on
time
and
undamaged.
I
made
the
repair
and
I'm
back
on
the
road.
I
saved
$400
through
PartsGeek.
I
will
be
doing
more
business
with
them
in
the
future.
Thank
you
for
a
promt,
efficient
and
friendly
service.
My
experience
at
drivetime
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be.
The
staff
was
friendly
and
accommodating.
They
helped
me
get
the
car
I
wanted
quickly
and
without
any
hassles.
I
have
purchased
cars
in
the
past
from
a
few
different
dealerships
and
my
experienxe
at
drivetime
was
alot
easier.
No
hassle,
friendly
staff
that
gets
you
into
the
car
you
want.
Vast
range
of
products,
backed
up
by
really
quick
and
friendly
service.
The
website
is
set
up
so
that
it
is
easy
to
get
the
correct
part
ordered.
This
site
has
all
the
parts
you'll
EVER
NEED.
They
sell
both
high
quality
AND
cost
effective
parts.
I've
found
everything
I
need.
Very
entertaining
guides.

Went
on
both
blue
and
red
bus
and
it's
nice
they
provide
the
poncho
for
rainy
days/wet
seats
for
the
top
seat(convertible).
As
always,
I
got

fast,
efficient
and
friendly
service
from
Dino
PC
in
supplying
and
shipping
a
new
PC.
When
I
couldn't
validate
the
pre-installed
copy
of
Windows,
I
was
able
to
get
straight
through
to
technical
support
(as
always
before),
who
patiently
explained
that
the
8
and
the
B
in
Windows
Product
Keys
are
almost
identical.
I
found
the
web
site
easy
to
use
and
the
best
value
around
for
Liverpool
airport.
Fast
shipping,
accurate
description,
easy
to
use
web
page
and
packed
safe.
Placed
my
first
order
after
a
lot
of
great
recommendations
from
various
forums.
Super
fast
shipping
and
products
were
as
described
on
site.
One
of
my
go
to
sites
now
based
on
customer
service
and
great
pricing.
No
problems
every
thing
was
as
stated
would
use
BolierJuice
everytime.
Good
price,
good
delivery
pleasant
careing
driver.
I
was
a
little
hesitant
to
begin
because
of
price,
but
purchased
anyway.
I
was
very
happy
when
I
opened
the
box.
I
will
definitely
use
PartsGeek
again
if
needed.
I
have
never
been
disappointed
by
B
&
H.
They
always
provide
what
they
say
they
will
and
I
have
never
had
any
problems.
Service
is
prompt
and
complete.
I'm
a
business
owner
in
the
USA
and
I
have
to
keep
a
strong
relationship
with
my
customers
in
different
parts
of
the
world
...
I
had
a
great
experience
with
this
florist
company
..
Patience
and
best
of
all
they
did
everything
to
impress
my
customers
...
Thank
you
for
everything
and
definitely
we'll
stay
in
business
The
website
is
excellent
and
easy
to
use.
Choosing
and
purchasing
was
also
very
straightforward.
The
only
minor
gripe
was
The
amount
of
time
it
took
to
arrive.
It
said
5
to
7
days.
It
took
over
two
weeks...
free
post
though
so
minor
issue
really.
Great
price
if
you
are
prepared
to
wait
a
bit.
I
thought
the
website
was
good
-
organisation
and
payment
was
all
clear
-
delivery
was
spot
on.
Everything
good
in
fact
but
be
aware:
Read
the
details
on
returns
etc...
that
they
send
you
by
mail.
According
to
their
information,
on
accepting
delivery,
you
are
supposed
to
open
all
the
parcels
and
check
all
the
contents
the
second
they
arrive
and
NOT
sign
off
on
them
if
you
are
unhappy
in
any
way.
No
offence
but
you
try
doing
that
with
every
single
item
of
a
sizeable
order
while
the
men
are
delivering
it
and
waiting
-
Ever
tried
to
check
every
rung
of
a
towel
radiator
to
make
sure
there
are
no
holes
or
dents
while
you've
got
someone
waiting
and
you're
refusing
to
sign
off
until
you
are
happy?
Or
unwrapping
each
set
of
taps
to
check
there
isn't
a
hideous
scratch
running
down
it?
Yeah,
no
pressure
at
all!
Come
on
guys:
Just
a
LITTLE
bit
of
flexibility
in
the
checking
of
orders
wouldn't
go
amiss!
Give
me
24
hours
to
actually
look
it
all
over
in
comfort
and
space,

without
creating
a
derby
of
destruction
in
my
own
hallway...
A
great
business
with
very
knowledgeable
employees.

They
have
everything
you
can
think
of
and
then
some!
A
truly
seamless
service,
I
would
recommend
Interparcel
to
anyone
who
wants
to
get
their
parcel
collected
and
delivered
without
fuss,
and
everything
is
completed
on
line
with
a
full
tracking
service
and
confirmation
of
delivery
to
your
phone.
Simple,
fast
and
secure!!!
Not
sure
if
it
is
just
my
location
but
the
facility
I
work
with
is
great
and
the
management
team
appears
to
be
genuinly
concerned
with
a
high
level
od
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
customer.
Happy
doing
business
with
these
folks!
Unacceptable
time
for
delivery
not
sure
who's
fault
theirs
or
fedex....
Delivery.com
works.

There
are
a
good
number
of
restaurants
available,
and
the
process
is
pretty
easy.

Unfortunately,
the
UI
is
far
from
perfect
and
Seamless
is
much
easier
and
faster
to
use.
No
booking
fees
was
the
biggest
reason
I
started
using
the
site,
and
they
helped
me
find
some
really
great
hotels
and
hostels
all
over
Europe.
Will
definitely
book
again!
What
a
joke
and
a
huge
waste
of
time.
This
transaction
was
a
nightmare,
my
first
and
LAST
from
Parts
Geek.
I
knew
exactly
what
part
I
needed
(by
industry
bearing
number,
and
OEM
original
number)
but
their
worthless
website/ordering
system
would
not
let
me
enter
the
part
number
I
needed,
but
by
application.
The
bearings
they
sent
me
didn't
even
apply
to
the
application
I
ordered
it
for.
Then
took
a
week
for
a
response,
no
phone
number
to
call
(I
finally
found
one
through
unconventional
methods).

To
I
found
the
web
site
easy
to
get
around
in,
located
my
parts,
paid
and
was
able
to
track
the
shipment
accurately.
I
am
very
pleased
and
will
be
telling
my
friends.
Excellent
job.
They
have
a
great
range
of
products,
informative
videos,
competitive
prices
but,
most
importantly,
it's
their
customer
services
that
stands
out.
Swift
reply
to
queries
and
usually
next
day
delivery
of
orders
-
highly
recommended!
While
the
product
worked
as
advertised,
it
took
some
delving
into
the
help
info
on
the
disk
to
find
that
the
Security
chip
in
the
Lenovo
T61p
BIOS
needed
to
be
disabled
to
run
the
clone.

I
have
been
unable
to
get
through
to
support
to
find
out
if
the
chip
then
needs
to
be
re-enabled.
I
thought
I
would
try
this
as
an
alternative
but
found
the
chocolates
far
too
sweet
and
no
real
flavour
of
chocolate,
more
like
a
Thornton's
or
Cadbury's
selection.
I
realise
that
many
people
prefer
this
type
of
chocolate
but
I
prefer
chocolates
made
with
high
cocoa
content
from
good
cocoa
beans.
The
fillings
I
found
insipid
and
lacking
in
flavour.
I
do
not
like
the
taste
of
Sorbitel
as
a
sweetner
and
really
has
no
place
in
chocolate.
These
chocolates
from
Cocoa
Boutique
are
just
not
for
me.
This
was
a
panic
delivery,it
had
to
be
there
on
time
and
I
wasn't

Parcel

picked
up

afternoon
(my

I

worried.
I

the
parcel
was
delivered
to

by
9:15
on
Monday
morning,astounding.
This
was
the

I
have
used

Would
definately
use
them

Jacksonville
fl.
Excellent
service
,
very
happy
with
purchase.
Could
not
believe
the
quality
of
the
chairs
we
ordered,
they
were
so
cheap
compared
to
the
shops
that
we
thought
that
they
would
of
been
inferior
quality.
Quite
the
opposite,
they
are
just
perfect
WELL
DONE
MADE.COM
and
thank
you
for
excellent
service.
I
ordered
the
part
for
my
shower.
The
part
was
not
in
stock
and
had
to
be
ordered.
I
knew
exactly
what
the
situation
was
with
my
order
at
all
times
due
to
there
communications
and
when
the
part
was
in
stock
it
was
sent
next
day
delivery,
3
days
in
all.
I
gave
cjs-cdkeys
a
try
based
on
my
brother's
recommendation.
I
was
a
little
hesitant
give
the
fact
that
I
hadn't
heard
of
the
service
before,
but
delivery
was
prompt
and
you
can't
just
argue
with
the
prices.
I'll
definitely
be
using
this
website
again.
Like
most
people
i
shop
the
internet
for
best
prices,
but
after
i
came
across

and
their

I
immediately
saved
it
as
a

Item
as
described.
Solid
material
well
worth
the
money.
It
was
the
correct
part.
Service
was
fine.
After
purchasing
a
phone
with
NFC
I
wasn't
really
sure
what
it
could
do
to
make
my
life
easier
or
more
fun!
Very
happy
with
Cruisesalefinder,
the
staff
replied
to
any
queries
promptly
and
the
procedure
of
booking
online
was
easy
and
safe.
Decided
to
use
them
again
when
we
decided
to
cruise
again.
Many
thanks,
This

was

is

impressed
with
order
and
delivery
I
used
to
use
craigslist
for
a
while
to
buy
things
I
knew
i'd
get
a
better
deal
on
second
hand,
but
after
a
few
sketchy
meet
ups
for
car
stereo
equipment
I
didn't
feel
so
good
abut
it
anymore.
I
mean,
I
took
the
proper
precautions
like
carrying
a
weapon
and
meeting
in
well
lit
places,
but
I'm
getting
too
old
for
that,
you
know?
when
my
washer
broke
i
went
online
looking
for
a
replacement
&
each
product
i
searched
for
"Appliances
online"
kept
cropping
up.
I'd
never
heard
off
them
but
reviews
were
good
&
prices
were
very
competitive
so
i
bit
the
bullet
and
ordered,
this
was
late
saturday
afternoon
so
i
wasnt
holding
out
much
hope
of
getting
delivery
before
the
following
week.
Fear
not
"Appliances
online"
would
deliver
my
washer
next
day(Sunday)
so
i
went
ahead
but
my
Comp
froze
during
the
secure
by
visa
payment
right
at
the
end
&
i
didnt
know
whether
order
had
gone
through,
had
my
money
been
taken
or
what??
I
found
their
phone
number
,
explained
what
had
happened
and
the
very
pleasant
operative
assured
me
that
the
transaction
hadnt
been
completed
so
she
took
my
order
over
the
phone
&
my
washer
was
delivered
on
Sunday
as
they
said.
Overall
i
was
very
impressed
by
the
service
that
they
gave
me
&
would
recommend
them
to
anyone

I

an

was

corrected

I
buy
a

of
stuff
online,
and
was
appalled
by
the
packaging
of
the
item
by
Gadget
Grotto.

Ok
-
so
they'd
wrapped
my
item
in
a
bit
of
bubble
wrap.

But
it
was
then
packed
into
a
plastic
bag,
leaving
the
gift
box
I
had
bought
so
badly
damaged
that
I
couldn't
give
it
as
a
gift
and
had
to
bin
it.

The
other
product
was
covered
in
sellotape
-
impossible
to
remove
without
damaging
the
package
and
opening
the
item.

Again
unable
to
give
as
a

3

only

Had
no
idea
what
the

would

just

This
was
the
first
time
I
had
to
make
a
payment
to
a
foriegn
bank.
However
the
process
was
very
simple.
During
the
data
entry
I
made
some
errors
but
the
system
made
it
clear
where
the
errors
were
which
enabled
me
to
correct
the
information
and
gave
me
confidence
that
all
was
entered
correctly.

you
might

love
their
vast
catalog
that
they
have
so
decided
to
give
them
a
try.
This
first
order
went
perfectly
so
I
cannot
speak
to
their
customer
service
but
if
there
were
problems
I
feel
confident
they
would
be
easy
to
contact
and
get
handled
well.
My
order
included
a
free
product
choice
(protein
bar
or
shaker),
the
protein
bars
were
very
tasty
and
I
might
drop
to
the
store
to
pick
some
up.
Their
packaging
was
a
sturdy
box
which
made
a
great
first
impression.
I
will
definitely
use
them
for
all
future
supplement
orders
and
I
highly
recommend
them
to
you!
I've
tried
to
contact
them
numerous
times
but
have
been
unsuccessful.
I've
submitted
a
ticket
to
see
what
has
been
going
on.
It's
almost
a
week
since
I
submitted
my
first
order,
so
that's
one
more
week
without
my
supplies.
This
is
the
last
time
I'll
try
ordering
something
from
them,
If
my
issue
doesn't
get
resolved
by
the
end
of
the
week,
I'll
look
somewhere
else
for
my
supplies
because
I've
never
had
any
order
issues
with
the
vitamin

with

Buying
tires
was
a
new
experience
for
me
and
I
had
no
idea
where
to
start.
I
called
the
guys
up
on
my
way
home
from
work
and
right
from
the
start
they
seemed
to
know
what
they
were
talking
about.
I
explain
to
them
my
driving
style
and
unlike
other
stores,
they
tried
to
sell
me
the
tire
that
was
right
for
me
not
the
most
expensive
tire.
They
didn't
take
advantage
of
someone
who
didn't
know
much
about
buying
tires,
rather
they
answered
with
what
seemed
to
be
honest
opinions.
If
you
ever
need
new
tires,
these
are
the
guys
to
go
to!
I
have
been
a
customer
off
and
on
since
the
1980s
and
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
experience.
They
actually
care
about
what
I
need
and
offer
great
suggestions
and
options.

I
was
never

I
had

toward

I
immediately
found
what
I
had

So
many
times
you
hear
about
people
being
taken
in
by
less
reputable
companies.
Not
these
guys.
They
put
me
to
ease
right
away.
They
keep
you
informed
at
all
aspects
of
your
case.
You
really
feel
the
want
to
help.
They
are
always
there
when
you
have
a
question.
Even
the
lawyer
assigned
to
you
is
available
to
talk
to.
I
now
sleep
at
night
instead
of
worrying
all
night
about
my
tax
problems.
Are
these
guys
the
best?

All
I
know
is
they
are
for
me.
In
all
fairness
I
should
first
state
that
shame
on
me
for
NOT
looking
at
all
the
negative
reviews
online,
Shame
on
me
for
NOT
looking
at
the
500+
negative
reports
on
the
BBB
(Better
Business
Bureau)
website.
Ordered
mid
afternoon,
arrived
the
next
day.
Most
pain
free
order
experience
I've
ever
had.
Neat
part
was
they
send
the
tracking
number
as
a
direct
link
to
shipper.
Just
click
on
it
and
you
go
directly
to
the
shippers
web

with
updated

I'll
continue
to
use

any

I
ordered
an
big
volume
of
goods
for
friends
and
I
to
tennisnuts
to
be
delivered
to
France.
We
receive
our
shipment
in
less
than
a
week
and
the
goods
were
well
packed.
I
recently
ordered
a
driven
chain
and
sprocket
kit
and
had
to
exchange
the
chain
for
a
different
one.
I
was
working
with
Allan
and
he
received
the
original
chain
and
ordered
the
new
one.
Driven
ended
up
not
having
the
chain
in
stock
and
had
to
wait
for
it
to
be
delivered
from
Japan.
I
needed
the
chain
by
a
certain
day
and
Allan
made
sure
it
was
sent
out
the
same
day
from
driven
directly
to
me
in
order
to
arrive
on
time.
I
appreciate
Allan's
willingness
to
help
me
out
and
make
a
customer
happy.
Thanks
to
him
and
the
entire
STG
family!
I
would
absolutely
recommend
his
company
to
anybody.
The
products
received
are
exactly
as
described.
In
the
age
when
things
seem
to
becoming

these

Very
slick

and
delivery
was
on

so
did
what
they
said
they
would.
Slight
issue
that
I
bought
a
piano
stool
as
part
of
a
package
but
when
it
arrived
it
was
not
what
I
expected
(looked
more
like
a
weight
bench
rather
than
piece
of
furniture)
-
partly
my
own
fault
for
not
checking
but
it
would
have
been
nice
for
them
to
have
included
a
picture.
We
cancelled
a

thru

they
called

confirmed

with
us,
promised
our
$220

It's
been

we
only
get
robo

now,
no

Ordering
was
a
doddle
receiving
was
not
quite
so
easy.
The

messed
up
on

got
it
now
so
no
harm
done.

Was

to
find
a

I

the

And

Hey,
I
needed
a
good
Shop
Manual
for
my
Son,
the
BMW
addict
,and
ordered
one
from
Parts
Geek.
It
was
what
I
wanted
at
a
good
price.
Only
problem
was
he
was
expecting
some
parts
and
opened
the
package
and
saw
his
birthday
present!

Oh
well
maybe
I
shouldn't
have
made
him
a
Junior!
It
is
very
nice
and
functional.
Service,
price
and

all
first

Makes

it

A

My

I
tried

and

Done!
The
item

was
delivered
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
despite
only
requesting
standard
delivery.
Packaging
was
exceptionally
robust
with
no
risk
of
damage
to
the
fragile
contents.
The
item
is
a

so

with
the

and
core

Love
it!
I
am
so
satisfied
with
what
Rebtel

to

I
find
the
calls
I

cheap
and
the

is
better
than

and
their

is
professional!

I
did
not

the

I
made
a

What
has
changed?
I
chose
Websticker.com
because
they
were
fast
responders.
They
emailed
me
first,
called
me
first,
and
sent
me
FREE

(cross-country)
in
2
days.
Their
follow-up
along
the
way
was
timely
and
unobtrusive.
Communication
was
perfect.

direct
has
a
excellent
selection
at
a
very

Even
though
the
frames
I
wanted
were

they

them
to
me
faster
than

you.

I
needed
a
Bathtub
for
my
travel
trailer,
found
Dyer's
online,
not

were
they
the

(Price-wise)

the

was

I
found
GAK
to
be
a
very
helpfull
and
efficient
company
to
deal
with.
They
did
not
have
my
initial
choice
of
guitar
in
stock
and
not
only
did
they
notify
me
of
this
immediately
thay
also
gave
me
various
options
based
on
my
first
choice.
I
ended
up
getting
what
I
wanted
which
was
then
delivered,
with

within
24hrs.
Would

I've
just
started
using
SupplementWarehouse.com
and
it's
by
far
the
best
place
to
buy
your
supplements
and
vitamins.

1)
Very
fast
shipping.

2)
By
far
the
best
prices
and
if
you
find
a

one
BOOM!!!!
they
give
you
an

than
what
you
found.

3)
Huge

4)
Who
doesn't
like
the
freebies
too???

I
just
ordered
everything
I
was
going
to
order
off
of
BodyBuilding.com
(which
is
a
great
site,
don't
get
me
wrong,
but
its
store
can't
compete
with
SupplementWarehouse.com)
plus
a
pre-workout
booster
and
my
ConCret
from
SupplementWarehouse.com
for
cheaper
than
what
BodyBuilding.com
was
going
to
charge
and
that
was
with
their
10%
off
Cyber
Monday
deal.

I
couldn't
recommend
this
site
any
higher
if
you're
looking
to
buy
some
vitamins
or
supplements.
Easy
to
order
with
continual
updates
on
tracking
the
progress
of
your
order
to
your
door.
I
called
up
Enterprise
car
rental
in
Germantown
MD,
the
sales
technician
was
very
friendly
and
assured
me
they
would
have
a
car
for
me
on
my
arrival.
The
I
requested
was
not
available
and
immediately
was
given
an
upgrade.
On
my
return
I
had
a
quick
ride
home
and
ready
for
my
next
event.
I
thank
Enterprise
for
taking
care
of
my
travel
needs
over
the
weekend.
My
only
concern
I
had
was
the
luxury
tax,
I
thought
it
was
way
to
high,
but
that
is
out
of
Enterprise
hands.
I
ordered
parts
for
two
different
cars
at
the
same
time.
I
needed
some
of
them
quickly
as
the
car
was
leaving
on
a
600
mile
trip
on
July
4.
The
parts
I
didn't
need
quickly
came
in
just
2
business
days,
sweet!
The
packing
list
listed
all
the
parts
and
I
never
got
a
tracking
number
for
the
parts
I
really
needed.
I
sent
an
email
and
got
a
response
that
didn't
make
sense.
I
sent
another
email
and
got
an
appropriate
response.
A
couple
emails
later
and
my
parts
came
the
day
before
the
trip
and
I
was
able
to
install
that
day.
All
in
all
the
parts
came
in
time
and
I
saved
quite
a
lot,
so
I'm
a
satisfied
customer.
Very
fast
delivery
and
even
when
I
had
selected
the
wrong
day
and
asked
if
I
could
change
my
delivery
day,
they
were
more
than
happy
to
help.
I've
bought
from
GAK
a
couple
of
times
and
they
have
always
been
great.
Ordered
a
headlight
assembly
and
it
was
shipped
and
had
her
installed
in
no
time.
It
was
a
reasonable
price
as
well
Business
WITHOUT
integrity.
I
found
a
better
price
on
an
item
elsewhere
and
entered
the
information
into
the
site
to
receive
a
price
match,
plus
5%
discount
(as
the
business
loves
to
advertise).
Lo
and
behold,
my
order
was
cancelled
the
very
next
day
for
an
alleged
'address
error'.
I
allege
that
they
do
not
uphold
their
policy
and
use
it
as
a
marketing
ploy.
Give
it
a
try
yourself
and
see.
why
on
earth
does
this
site
send
you
the
confirmation
to
print
that
is
13
pages
in
double
sized
letters.
Great
prices,
very
helpful
staff
and
great
products,
one
of
the
best
online
companies
I've
used
No
complaints
on
product
and
price
but
I
think
it
is
unfair
to
pretend
a
sale
is
ending
when
it
is
not.
The
sale
has
been
ending
(complete
with
countdown
clocks
etc)
and
been
extended
several
times-
this
causes
customers
to
rush
and
panic
buy
when
there
was
never
any
intention
to
end
the
sale,
a
bit
crafty...
Both
the
chairs
I
bought
and
the
table
had
fittings
missing,
which
I
had
to
go
and
buy
myself?
If
the
makers
can't
even
count
how
can
you
expect
their
"master

to
do
a
quality
job
on
the
furniture.
I
was
expecting
big
things
from
the
flashy
website,
but
quality
is
somewhere
between
Dwell
and
Argos
for
me
and
wish
I
gone
elsewhere
In
the
past
I
have
had
exceptional
service,
this
year
I
was
not
told
about
a
change
in
ordering.
So
consequently
my
order
was
late.
The
product
is
great.
I
wished
I
would
have
known
about
the
change
when
I
ordered.
Other
than
that
I
very
happy.
would
recommend
this
-
its
well
worth
the
money
(only
down
side
was
there
was
a
mark
on
the
top
surface)
Great
company
I've
used
twice
now
-
will
always
go
back
to
them
I
ordered
my
engagement
ring
from
them
and
was
very
happy
with
how
everything
turned
out.

Their
staff
was
extremely
helpful
throughout
the
process.

I
highly
recommend
them.
I
am
very
satisfied
with
the
product,
the
promptness
of
service
and
delivery
(international),
and
the
security
of
online
shopping
PhotonLight.com
has
provided.

However,
one
of
the
two
identical
product
I
purchased
seem
noticeably
dimmer
than
the
other.

I
assume
this
is
due
to
the
freshness
of
the
battery
installed,
and
certainly
hoping
not
because
of
a
faulty/worn-out
bulb.

Nevertheless,
satisfaction
sure
is
guaranteed.
Have
just
had
a
daughter

Lee
was
so
personable
and
willing
to
help
even
after
office
hours.
She
calmed
my
wife
and
allowed
my
family
a
stress
free
weekend.
In
closing
she
sold
me
the
perfect
shirt,
the
perfect
price,
and
met
the
delivery
date.
Ordered
the
Cobra
29
pickup
package
and
it
was
exactly
what
i
wanted!
Ordering
was
easy.
Paying
was
even
easier.
Have

recommended

Order
junior
squash
shoe
for
son,
product
arrived
next
day,
which
saved
me
no
end
of
harassment
off
son.
Excellent
service.
Initially,
the
prices
drew
me
to
SelectSpecs.
My
very
first
pair
(rimless,
lightweight
polycarbonate,
UV
protected)
were
a
mere
£18.
And
I
far
preferred
them
to
my
old
store
bought
£300
pair.
So,
when
the
time
came
for
a
newer
pair,
SelectSpecs
was
the
only
place
I'd
consider.
The
choice
is
tremendous,
even
including
designer
names
if
I
wanted
them.
And
as
affordable
as
the
lower
range
is,
nothing
is
of
poor
quality
(I
know,
cause
I've
bought
three
pairs
so
far).
Also,
no
need
to
worry
about
the
whole
selection
process
(entering
prescription,
working
out
"PD",
frame
measurements),
it
isn't
as
daunting
as
you
might
think.
Everything
is
clearly
explained
at
each
step.
I
feel
I'm
being
treated
by
my
very
own
optician.
But
what
I
really
love
is
this;
wearing
my
shiny
smart
specs
for
the
first
time,
&
saying
to
my
friends:
"Guess
how
much
I
paid
for
these!"
I
went
in
with
a
few
laptop
problems
and
they
were
sorted
within
a
day.
Very
cost
effective.
Been
a
first
time
customer,
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect.
They
had
exactly
what
I
wanted
at
a
better
(cheaper)
price
than
anyone
else
I
could
find,
only
slight
niggle
was
delivery
time
-
these
days,
a
week
is
a
bit
long
I
have
ordered
a
spare
part
for
my
car
with
24/7
and
I
am
very
pleased
of
the
many
replies
from
their
suppliers,
however
I
was
unlucky
to
pick
one
supplier
that
didn't
fulfil
the
agreed
prompt
delivery.
I
even
paid
an
extra
amount
so
that
my
order
would
be
delivered
to
me
on
the
agreed
date.
The
result
is
that
I
spend
a
fortune
for
two
days
for
paying
a
taxi
in
going
to
my
work.
I
received
my
order
anyway
and
I
am
happy
with
it
as
it
is
the
correct
part
that
I
need.
That
is
why
I
gave
only
4
stars
in
my
survey.
I
bought
an
8GB
additional
RAM
for
my
laptop,
it
arrived
on
time
and
I
install
it
to
my
machine.
It
worked
perfectly.
I
highly
recommend
OFFTEK
to
everybody
who
are
looking
to
buy
additional
RAM
to
laptops.
My
shower's
PRV
burst
due
to
a
kink
in
the
shower
hose.
I
went
online
to
shower
doctor
and
ordered
the
parts,
also
read
some
answers
on
the
FAQS
on
how
to
repair
shower.
As
soon
as
the
ordered
part
arrived,
I
fitted
it
and
my
shower
worked
perfectly
now,
as
if
nothing
happened
to
it.
Thank
you
shower
doctor.
I
did
a
pretty
thorough
Google

visited

i
bought
an
engagement
ring
from
brilliance
in
late
october.

i
made
the
purchase
online
rather
blindly
(as
i
did
not
know
too
much
about
diamonds).

i
instantly
got
a
call
from
one
of
the
girls
in
customer
service,
letting
me
know
that
she
did
not
think
the
diamond
i
selected
was
a
great
fit
for
the
ring.

for
about
20-30
minutes,
she
took
the
time
to
educate
me
on
all
the
standard
criteria
for
diamonds
and
gave
me
many
different
options.

i
picked
out
a
diamond
based
on
her
recommendation
and
she
literally
put
me
on
hold,
called
the
diamond
supplier,
inspected
the
ring
and
got
back
to
me
within
minutes.

the
first
time
she
did
this,
she
didn't
have
faith
in
the
supplier
because
he
couldn't
provide
a
picture
and
then
went
to
the
next
option.

she
did
the
same
process
and
indicated
the
diamond
looked
and
sounded
good.

i
made
the
purchase,
got
the
ring
and
proposed.

my
fiance
accepted,
but
i
found
out
i
had
the
wrong
ring
size.

due
to
wanting
to
have
the
ring
for
the
holidays,
we
took
it
to
a
jewelry
shop
to
get
resized.

everyone
that
looked
at
the
ring
gave
it
very
high
praises
and
were
really
impressed.

brilliance
is
a
top
notch
organization
and
makes
it
really
easy
for
those
less
knowledgable
about
jewelry.
i
rather
enjoy
my
skin
that
i
ordered.
i
thought
i
ordered
a
hard
cased
one
but
apparently
it
was
just
a
sticker
for
my
phone.
i
usually
don't
like
the
sticker
ones
however
this
one
is
of
excellent
quality
so
i
am
still
happy
with
it,
even
if
they
did
send
me
slightly
the
wrong
thing.
I
got
my
key
instantly
after
paying
with
Moneybookers
(as
advertised).
I
had
no
issues
with

Keys
service!
Great
customer
service.
I
will
never
travel
on
an
airplane
again
with
my
golf
bag.
The
ship
sticks
team
is
incredible
and
completely
dedicated.
Love
it.
I
have
Jim
Murray's
Bible
on
my
iPad
and
combining
his
reviews
with
what
I
already
know
I
then
looked
at
the
Exchange's
website
-
and
some
others
of
course.

I
think
I
found
all
the
whiskies
I
was
interested
in
and
most
were
reasonably
within
my
budget.

Incidently,
it's
the
best
website
for
whiskies
I
found.

However,
I'm
not
fond
of
delivery
charges
-
which
is
why
I
use
Amazon
so
much
and
without
them
I
think
I
would
use
the
site
more
often
rather
than
leaving
it
till
I
had
a
largish
order
-
I
reckon
I
would
buy
more.

I
also
wondered
how
one
gets
a
discount,
I
saw
where
you
could
enter
a
voucher
code;
I
think
I've
spent
enough
to
merit
one.

But
overall
if
you
are
interested
in
Single
Malts
and
in
whiskies
from
around
the
world
the
Whisky
Exchange
is
a
great
company
to
use.
I
brought
my
cloudstix
e-cigeratte
to
help
break
the
habit.
I
ordered
next
day
delievery
and
cloud
stix
lived
up
to
that.
Unfortunatelly
Royal
Mail
failed
to
deliever
as
they
said
they
couldnt
gain
access
to
my
flat.
Cloudstix
rang
me
to
tell
me
what
had
happened.
So
the
blame
is
with
Royal
Mail.
Anyway
after
smoking
15
a
day
i
have
immediately
cut
down
to
none!
I
have
been
smoke
free
for
four
days
and
dont
even
wish
for
a
normal
cigerette.
I
would
recomend
this
company
to
anyone.
Ordered

VERY
HELPFUL
PLACE
TO
PIND
PARTS
I
have
ordered
over
$1,000
from
this
company
the
last
3-4
years
and
I
couldn't
be
happier.
I
always
receive
my
supplements
promptly
and
the
order
is
always
as
advertised.
I've
heard
some
people
complain
about
this
site
but
I
honestly
have
no
complaints!!
Great
site
and
easy
to
use
looking
forward
to
doing
more
business!
Have
not
had
any

I
had
never
heard
of
this

so
when
I
was
booking
the

it
was
a
surprise
that
they
could
be

using

I
don't
trust
very
many

but
I
would
recommend
PartsGeek
and
I
will
use
them
again.

in

I

I
had
a
great
experience
at

Fair

all
because
of
Rick!

He
was
professional
and
took
the
time
to
really
educate
me
on
the
products
but
without
being
pushy.

I
was
comfortable
in
the
waiting
room
and
didn't
have
to
wait
long
to
be
on
my
way.

Rick
has
made
me
a
Town

customer
for
life!

Thanks
Rick!!
I
value
hostelworld
because
it
is
making
it
easy
for
me
to
book
hostels
for
several
reasons.
First,
I
appreciate
the
reviews
of
other
guests
which
in
almost
any
case
is
a
reliable
indicator
of
the
actual
quality.
Second,
the
design
of
the
website
is
appealing
and
it's
intuitively
understandable.
Lastly,
as
it
is
a
major
hostel
website,
almost
any
hostel
that
exists
is
actually
listed
on
this
website.
Availability

we
would

When
traveling,
hostelworld.com
is
always
the
first
place
I
go
to
obtain
reviews
for
hostel
availability
due
to
their
up
to
date
reviews.
This
company
was
a
very
friendly
one,
it
was
just
amazing!
It
had
a
great
idea
of
money
making
and
was
fairly
easy
to
operate.
I
didn't
like
that
they
kept
updating
the
search
boxes,
meaning
I
constantly
had
to
put
in
new
codes
into
my
website.
I
was
pleased
at
how

a
few
weeks
of
each
other.

Called
locally
to
see
how
much
and
the
replacement
cost
was
more
than
both
laptops
cost
combined.

Found
Laptopscreens
and
fixed
them
both
for
under
$60!!

Great
screens,
great
service,
fast
shipping
and
the
tutorials
are
spot
on!!!
We
are
doing
a
complete
gut-rehab
of
our
master
bath.

The
Hudson
Reed
products
we've
purchased,
from
valves
and
shower
fixtures
to
accessory
pieces
have
exceeded
our
expectations
in
both
quality
and
design.

We
did
a
lot
of
research
and
shopping
before
purchasing;
we
could
not
be
more
pleased.
You
can't
beat
a
good
deal.
When
the
labels
arrived
my
doubts
were
erased.

They
were
visually
just
what
I
wanted
and
the
quality
as
much
as
I
could
have
wished
for.

Best
of
all
I
did
not
go
broke
getting
what
I
wanted.


I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
your
labels
to
anyone
in
the
market.
Extremely
happy.
I
was
searching
through
a
variety
of
websites
looking
for
the
parts
I
needed
for
my
car
and
none
compare
to
the
excellent
pricing
and
quality
of
service
I
found
at
partsgeek.com.
Not
only
did
it
cost
a
third
of
the
price
of
some
other
stores,
but
my
package
was
delivered
in
two
days!
Amazing.
I
can't
imagine
ever
having
a
better
online
purchasing
experience
for
the
rest
of
my
days.
I
love
this
site.
I
have
bought
all
of
my
proteins,
preworkouts
and
protein
bars
from
supplementwarehouse.com....
The
only
down
fall
is
you
have
to
watch
what
you
buy
because
it
might
be
expired.
Very
easy
to
understand
their
sizing,
ordered
appropriately
and
my
order
was
delivered
within
2
days.

Never
an
issue
when
ordering
and
the
quality
is
always
exceptional.
Cheers

Ordered
2

This

(it
just

but
a
quick
call
and
a

confirmed
my

Its
generally
very

there
are
some

I

never

with
the

the
only
problems
I
have
ever
had
have
been
with
the
delivery
company
not
delivering

when
they
said
they
would.
Have
ordered
5
times
now
and
was
satisfied
every
time.
Quick

Denmark)!
Awesome
Experience!
Good

high
s/h
cost
work
out
to
about
the
same
as
everyone
else.
My
order
took
more
than
48
hours
before
I
had
a
tracking
number.
I
made
a
similiar
order
from
VitaDigest.
The
product
cost
was
more
but
the
s/h
cost
were
half.
Total
worked
out
to
be
about
the
same.
The
big
difference,
my
product
from
VD
took
3
days,
SW
took
9.
When
I
asked
SW
about
it,
they
gave
me
a
run
around
about
price
matching.
I
didn't
ask
for
a
price
match,
I
paid
the
advertised
price.
I
think
these
guys
are
probably
doing
3rd
party,
that's
why
it
takes
so
long
to
process
orders.
If
you
can
wait
and
you
live
close,
I
guess
they
aren't
bad.
Was
searching
Amazon
for
edger
blades
when
I
happen
to
notice
this
online
retailers
name
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
Never
heard
of
them
but
on
a
whim
searched
their
catalog
and
found
their
price
for
what
i
wanted
was
more
than
50%
cheaper.
Ordered
the
edger
blades
and
not
long
after
I
received
them
via
Fedex.
Would
order
from
them
if
I
have
another
need
for
garden
products.
Good

Equipatron.
This
was
my
second
purchase.
A
very
good
delivery
and
product
service
I
used
to
be
the
guy
who
would
look
to
GNC
for
my
supplements.
It
seemed
like
every
time
I
would
walk
into
that
store
they
were
telling
me
it
was
time
to
renew
my
fifteen
dollar
gold
card.
The
thing
about
their
"gold
card"
was
that
the
prices
on
their
product
were
so
over
priced
that
it
actually
made
it
seem
like
you
were
getting
a
good
deal.
One
day,
for
whatever
the
reason,
I
got
online
just
to
look
up
some
reviews
for
supplements
and
happened
to
stumble
upon
SupplementWarehouse.com.
I
quickly
was
able
to
use
their
search
box
to
find
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for,
and
could
not
believe
my
eyes
when
I
saw
the
prices
that
were
listed
for
the
supplements.
I
had
never
realized
that
I
was
paying
up
tp
30
and
40
dollars
more
at
GNC!
Not
only
do
they
have
the
cheapest
prices,
but
they
offer
you
free
samples
of
new
supplements
as
well
as
give
away
some
that
might
be
only
a
few
weeks
old,
at
no
cost.
I
am
on
SupplementWarehouse
at
least
once
a
month
and
refuse
to
go
to
any
other
website
or
store.
SupplementWarehouse
is
hands
down
the
best
place
to
find
the
exact
supplement
you
are
looking
for,
and
pay
the
lowest
proce
to
get
it.
I
encourage
anyone
that
may
use
a
different
site
or
even
a
store
to
check
SupplementWarehouse
out
for
themselves
to
find
what
everyone
else
on
their
site
is
enjoying.

the

they'll

places

the
only
catch
is
the
shipping
costs
are
high.

you
can
compare

these

on

and
at

it's

I
still

this

I

£30
worth
of
photo

But
the
service
was
outstanding!
Excellent
price
&
good
consistent
product
(it's
a
pain
in
bum
when
packs
of
single
coated
paper
aren't
packed
consistently).
Emails
were
sent
out
by

all
thro'
the
delivery
process
but
the
clincher
was,
quite
voluntarily,
the
one
advising
of
the
delivery
time
within
a
one
hour
window.
'Ho-ho'
one
thinks,
but
delivery
was
bang
in
middle
of
the
slot...and
delivery
guy
called
me
'sir',
not
'mate'.

My
first
order
with
you
but
will
look
forward
to
the
next.
You
have
imoressed
me.
Thanks
I
purchase
a
radiator
for
my
car
and
i
found
it
brand
new
for
a
cheap
price.
Cheapest
price
with
warranty.
Shipping
was
fast
and
i
would
recommend
all
friends
to
order
their
auto
parts
here
This
is
the
second
LCD
Ive
ordered
from
screen
country.
Their
prices
are
reasonable,
the
website
is
easy
to
use
and
overall
they
offer
great
products
with
lots
of
different
shipping
options.
Look
forward
to
dealing
with
them
again
in
the
future.
Arrived
earlier
than
predicted,
good
quality,
and
better
price
than
all
the
competitors
PartsGeek
is
a
great
website
with
more
selection
than
even
the
"big
part"
names,
the
prices
are
very
competitive,
the
order
process
was
a
breeze
and
the
delivery
time
exceeded
expectations,
all
great
attributes.
However,
I
was
dismayed
to
find
that
two
(2)
of
the
three
(3)
parts
ordered
were
incorrect
and
now
I
must
initiate
an
RMA
to
get
the
right
parts.
Unfortunately
I
aleady
paid
a
mechanic
to
replace
the
one
(1)
correct
part
and
now
must
pay
again
to
have
the
replacement
parts
installed
(which
would
have
been
free
installs
the
first
time
through
since
theyy
required
removal
and
re-install
for
the
correct
part),
argh.
the
store
has
exotic
products.....
some
such
as
ormus
and
zappers
are
very
hard
to
find
in
any
retail
store.....everyone
there
is
very
friendly
these
cookies
are
LILLY'S
favorite
cookie,
she
eat's
one
and
hides
the
other
for
later;
usually
at
bedtime.
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
speed
and
efficiency
of
my
order
being
delivered
so
close
to
Christmas.
I
will
not
hesitate
to
use

When
something
goes

its
only
then
you
can

and
test
the
real
level
of
customer
service
from
a
company.
My
order
went
wrong,
and
the
customer
service
team
did
a
poor
job
of
helping
me
solve
my
issue.
I
got
the
impression
they
really
didn't
care.
In
this
day
and
age
that's
just
not
acceptable
and
not
good
enough
because
so
many
other
companies
really
genuinely
do
care.

I
use
this
source
with
planned
projects,
to
save
on
additional
shipping
costs.
Businesses
use

express
shipping,
so
they
can
move
vehicles
out
of
their
shops
in
a
timely
manner.
The

the

the
most

in
ANY
of
the
supplement
company's
out
there
I
ordered
parts
and
they
sent
them.

No
hassle,
no
BS.
The
items
arrived
quickly
,
they
had
been
packed
carefully
and
arrived
in
great
shape,
this
was
a
good
purchase
and
I
would
buy
from
American
RV
again.
So
far,
after
10
years
of
buying,
I
have
never
had
an
issue
that
was
not
resolved
promptly
and
professionally.
Most
of
the
transitions
though,
have
been
seamless.

up

They
do
what
they
say,
match

and
beat
them.
Can't
ask
for
anything
else.
The
only
gripe
that
I
have
is
their
shipping
and
handling
can
be
a
little
expensive,
but
in
this
economy
understandable.
The
money
they
save
you
makes
up
for

I
have
been
very
impressed
with
the
whole
Blackcircles.com
experience.
The
website
was
fairly
easy
to
follow
and
ordering
the
required
tyres
was
quite
straight
forward.
I
did
think
there
wasn't
a
large
amount
of
choice
but
I
was
able
to
find
suitable
tyres
at
a
decent
price.
On
arrival
at
the
nominated
garage
I
discovered
that
they
had
the
correct
details
of
my
booking
and
the
tyres
were
fitted
in
the
time
specified.
All
in
all
I
have
been
very
pleased
with
the
service
provided
by
Blackcircles
and
I
will
certainly
be
using
them
again.
Plus
I
got
triple
Tesco
Clubcard
points
which
was
great!
Hi
All,
Ordering
is
easy.
The
"try

feature
is
a
great
concept.

Pricing
is
highly
competitive,
and
customer
service
is
quite
good.
Great
service
and
great
prices.
The
salesman
who
helped
service
my
vehicle
was
very
professional
and
took
the
time
to
explain
everything
to
me.
Will
recommend
to
all
my
friends
and
family!
I
have
had
to
wait
in
for
a

with
my
order
very
professional
and
kept

throughout
the

Would
not

of

from
them.
Montway

quick
to

They

kept

up

Definitely

recommend
PartsGeek!
The
website
works
really
well
and
the
discounts
by

is
a
bonus.

Generally
this
does
work
pretty
well.
I've
ordered
maybe
5
or
6
times.


I've
had
a
couple
of
occassions
when
the
delivery
has
been
outside
the
time
quoted.

Once
it
took
a
full
15
working

for

I
was
in
the
Mavis

location
on
East
Ridge
Rd
for
3
hours
just
to
find
and
repair
a
leak
in
my

So,
like
any
parent
would,
I
allow
my
children
to
play
with
my
Nexus
7
tablet.
My
son
loves
playing
my
tablet
so
much
that
he
uses
it
more
than
I
do
-
which
is
why
when
he
stopped
using
it
I
knew
something
was
wrong.
I
eventually
found
my
tablet
hidden
in
a
closet
whit
the
screen
busted
on
it;
I
asked
my
son
what
happened
and,
as
most
children
would
reply,

he
said
I
don't
know.
Eventually
he
fessed
up
to
dropping
it
on
the
concrete,
which
proves
that
tablets
and
concrete
don't
make
good
couples.

Hi,
I
purchased
my

and
they
were

I
paid
to

and
bought
a
pair
4"
too
large
but
they
fit.

to
come
over

talk

some

showed
me
a

and
quoted
me
a
price
then
when
he
went
to
the
register
and
looked
it
up,
the
price
was
$10
more
and
he
wouldnt
give
me
the
original
price.

Still
bought
the
product
since
it
was
a
good
price
for
it,
for
what
i
needed.
I
had

Really
impressive
customer
service,
polite
and
professional.
The
product
was
excellent
quality
and
it
arrived
in
no
time
at
all.
We
were
amazed
at
the
choice
and
competitive
price
when
we
viewed
the
website.
Same
day
turnaround,
nice
formatting
and
accurate
translation.
Reasonable
price.
The
light
shipped
out
really
fast
&
i
recieved
my
light
a
lot
sooner
than
most
companies
would
have
.
I
hear
the
customer
service
is
top
notch
,
hope
I
dont
have
to
find
out
for
myself
!!!LOL

The
light
works
great
&
is
alot
brighter
than
I
thought
it
would
be
.
I
am
really
pleased
so
far
.
Keep
up
the
good
work
!!!
As
a
repeat
customer,
I
have
always
been
impressed
with
the
quality
of
customer
service,
and
quality
of
the
product
that
B
&
H
provides.
I
have
given
my
opinion
many
times,
and
it
remains
the
same...


completely
satisfied!
I
have
been
a
regular
customer
for
several
years,
and
have
never
had
reason
to
complain.
Highly
recommended!
Great
Price
for
quality
product
and
even
better,
Free
Postage!
Prompt
shipment,
product
as
described;
but
shipped
via
Smart
Post
so
fedex
doesn't
track
(or
care)
it
was
so
easy
,they
turned
up
on
time
and
it
only
took
10
minutes
to
fit
2
new
tyres
The
services
of
Rush
My
Passport
are
excellent.
I
recommend
it
highly.
Good
prices
fast
shipping
I
would
certainly
recommend
that
you
use
this
company,
the
staff
were
friendly
and
went
out
of
their
way
to
provide
me
with
a
solution
when
we
discovered
that
my
parts
were
obsolete.
It
was
dealt
with
in
under
12
hours
and
the
items
that
I
had
incorrectly
ordered
were
returned
and
the
credit
was
in
my
bank
account
on
the
day
of
the
return
delivery
to
NSS.
We
found
the
products
easily
on
the
web
site
we
made
the
purchase
which
was
a
very
simple
process.
The
DHL
delivery
was
made
on
Bank
Holiday
Monday
27th
May.
The
packaging
was
excellent
offering
lots
of
protection
for
the
products.
We
are
really
pleased
with
our
buying
experience
from
David
Shuttle.
Purchased
my
second
item
through
McGivern's
diamonds
and
I
can't
recommend
enough.
They
custom
designed
a
ring
setting
based
on
a
picture
of
a
similar
ring
and
it
looks
impeccable.
Every
response
seemed
to
come
minutes
after
sending
a
question.
Both
prices
and
services
are
excellent!
Need
more
variety
for
men.

Last
year
I
sold
my
home
in
a
neighboring
town
and
bought
a
new
home
in
Lafayette,
LA.
I
got
online
to
research
available
security
system
options
and
SafeMart
offered
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for
which
was
a
wireless
system
independent
of
a
telephone
land
line.
The
only
reason
I
had
kept
my
land
line
at
my
old
home
was
for
the
security
system.
SafeMart
offers
a
variety
of
packages
from
basic
to
all
the
bells
and
whistles.
Their
online
and
phone
support
is
really
good
and
their
agents
are
friendly
and
knowledgable--you
will
not
be
talking
to
someone
in
another
country
reading
answers
to
your
questions
from
a
troubleshooting
guide.
My
system
was
very
easy
to
install
and
was
pre-programmed
for
my
specific
needs.
I'm
able
to
check
and
arm/disarm
my
system
from
a
remote
on
my
keychain
and
can
access
my
system
from
my
smart
phone
(checking
history
of
sensor
events,
arm/disarm,
etc).
I
get
all
this
along
with
excellent
monitoring
service
for
the
price
I
paid
before
for
just
for
monitoring
and
I
no
longer
have
to
pay
for
a
phone
land
line.
I
also
have
the
option
to
upgrade,
add
sensors,
cameras
which
can
be
monitored
on
my
smart
phone,
outdoor
sirens,
etc.
at
any
time.
Everything
works
as
advertised
and
their
support
is
top
notch.
I
highly
recommend
SafeMart.
I
was
amazed
at
the
efficiency
of
the
process.

When
on

it
is
easy
to
find
the
items
your
looking

They
are

I
went
to
all
of
my
local
stores
looking
for
a
regulator
and
no
one
had
one
and
could
not
order
one
either.
Found
partsgeek
on
Google
and
they
had
the
part
and
even
twenty
dollars
cheaper
then
my
local
stores
if
they
would
of
had
one.
Same
name
of
part
for
a
lot
less.
They
know
how
to
get
peoples
business.
I
am
happy
with
the
whole
experience
with
the
parts

From
ease
of
ordering,
quality
of

and
quickness
of

Great

and
highly

Just
placed
my

Staff
where
very
nice
when
contacted.
however
delivery
took
alot
longer
than
advitised.
Very
easy
service
only
thing
id
day
is
payment
should
be
quicker.
The
ordered
items
arrived
on
time,
well
packaged
and
with
a
suprise
gift!
I
have
no
hesitation
at
all
in
recommending
this
comapny,
who
have
not
forgotten
that
the
customer
comes
first
at
all
times.
I
am
very
glad
with
myprotein
because
their
products
have
a
good
quality,
the
price
are
low
and
the
shipping
is
really
fast.
The
staff
was
very
friendly
and
helped
to
answer
questions
and
provide
good
recommendations.

For
the
price,
I
thought
it
was
great
to
receive
5
initial
designs
and
a
couple
of
rounds
of
revisions.

Maria,
my
Project
Coordinator
also
followed
up
on
an
email
question
within
minutes
on
a
late
Friday
afternoon.

Very
helpful.

My
feedback
was
also
incorporated
nicely
on
each
round
of
revisions.
A
fantastic
way
to
book
your

for

installed
on
Saturday.

TYC

1/6th
the

no
way
I
could
have
bought
parts
and
repaired
it
for
such
a
good
price.

Fast,
easy,
right,
what
else
can
I
say?

Already
recommended
this
to
my
friends.
I
have
a
special
needs
child
and
we
moved
into
a
new
home.

The
shower
floor
liner
we
had
wasn't
working
and
he
fell
one
morning.

This
has
fixed
the
problem!

I
did
make
sure
to
clean
the
bottom
of
the
shower
with
Acetone
first
so
that
I'd
get
a
good
bond.

Thank
you.
Used
them
last
time
and
highly
satisfied,
so
got
to
give
them
another
go.
I've
recommended
to
others
and
heard
only
good
reports
Very
good
people
to
deal
with,
very
satisfied
will
buy
from
again
in
the
future.
The
prices
at
wiggle
are
great
and
so
is
the
free
shipping.
I
was
very
impressed
by
the
delivery
estimate
to
the
USA.
My
package
arrived
one
day
later
than
estimated,
no
worries
here.
Thanks
Wiggle
team
for
my
new
cycling
goodies.
It
seems
that
as
soon
as
one
places
an
order,
the
requested
item
is
put
in
the
post
straight
away
and
arrives
shortly
afterwards.
I
am
very
happy
to
not
only
deal
again
with
them
but
willingly
recommend
their
service
to

anyone.
The
toner
cartridges
were
delivered
within
two
days
of
ordering.
I
am
both
impressed
by
this
and
the
fact
that
it
was
very
competitive
in
price
by
far.
I
will
certainly
be
ordering
again
from
hot
toner,
this
was
actually
my
third
delivery.
Low
price,quick
shipment,and
good
quality,I
recommend
this
company!
Just
what
i
wanted
thank
you
will
come

Great
website
with
some
interesting
research
supporting
their
product.

Neat
awards
program.

Responsive
customer
service
and
quick
deliveries.

My
only
complaint
is
steep
price
on
their
supplements.
Purchased
some
replacement
Fibreglass
Tent

Very
quick

reasonably
priced
and
easy
to

Would
use
again.
As
you
know
at
our
age
your
eyesight
goes
and
you
are
always
looking
for
your
glasses,
I
have
solved
this
problem,
I
use
Spectacles
Direct
and
have
done
over
the
last
few
years,
I
can
buy
one
pair
of
distance
and
one
pair
of
reading
for
a
total
of
£40,
I
have
previously
used
the
high
street
opticians
but
as
you
know
their
offers
are
not
what
they
seem
to
be,
You
know
2
for
1
offers,
but
you
can't
have
a
reading
pair
and
a
distance
pair
you
have
to
have
2
pairs
of
both.
With
Spectacles
Direct
I
solved
the
problem
and
usually
get
them
delivered
to
my
door
quicker
than
the
high
street.
I'm
very
happy
with
the
cycling
jersey,
sizes
run
small,
but
I
knew
this
and
ordered
one
size
up.
Bought
a
guard
after
my
brother
in
law
recommended
you.
Been
pondering
over
the
official
Citroen
guard
but
the
horrendous
price
was
putting
me
off.
Finally
plumped
for
yours
and
it
fits
really
well;
goes
in
and
comes
out
easily.
Everyone
is
happy
now
except
the
dogs
who
can't
mess
up
the
seats
anymore!
Will
recommend
to
anyone
I
hear
needing
a

guard.
Quality

Needed

Excellent

will
continue

use
them.
Good

the

as
I
told

my

Easy

You
charged
me
$7.00
to
send
me
a
gift
card
for
a
restaurant.
It
was
a
gift
card
for
my
grandson.
You
didn't
even
give
me
the
option
to
make
it
out
in
his
name
and
send
it
to
me.
I
should
have
just
wrote
him
a
check
and
gave
it
to
him
on
Christmas.
I
could
have
given
him
the
$7.00
I
gave
you..
I
bought
another
gift
card
on
the
internet.
There
was
no
charge
for
the
service,
they
sent
me
an
e-mail
to
print
out
the
gift
card.

I
didn't
have
to
wait
to
get
it..
You
even

Just
started

riding
and
wanted
some
advice
on
wheels
and
the
service
was
excellent
I
ordered
a

of
wheels
and
they
came
the
next
day
I've
been
dealing
with
these
guys
for
years,
no
problems
at

would
(and
do)
recommend
them
to
all
my
friends.
No
more
then
30
secs

ask

everyone

a
car
or
the

to
just
drive

their

beat
most

Due
to
a
change
in
flight
timings,
I
had
to
amend
our
arrival
time
and
the

of
the

This
was
no

for

and
was

I
have
been
purchasing
parts
from
PartsGeek
for
a
number
of
years
and
I
have
found
them
to
be
very
competent
and
their
customer
service
has
been
exceptional.
Every
part
that
I
have
requested
has
been
the
correct
part.
I
made
the
mistake
once
of
buying
parts
from
another
supplier
because
they
were
less
expensive
but
that
was
a
big
mistake.
Stick
with
PartsGeek
and
you
wont
go
wrong.
I've
ordered
from
STG
a
number
of
times
over
the
past
1
to
1-1/2
years.
I've
had
to
return
ONE
item
due
to
me
ordering
the
wrong
size.
Returning
it
and
getting
the
replacement
went
even
smoother
than
they
advertise.
I've
since
ordered
a
number
of
other
times
and
all
I
can
say
is,
there's
no
reason
to
shop
around
even.
Now
I
just
go
to
them
and
order.
Even
if
their
price
was
a
bit
higher
(which
it's
usually
better
or
the
same)
I
would
still
buy
from
them
just
because
CONFIDENCE
is
worth
something
to
me.
It's
truly
and
"Order
it
and
forget
it"
kind
of
deal.
Not
only
would
I
recommend
them,
I
suggest
them!
Great
parts
list
to
choose
from,
but
the
shipping
destroyed
the
parts.
Get
that
fixed
and
your
service
will
be
good
I
ordered
some
contact
lenses
on
several
occasions,
and
was

by
the

the

times.
Haven't
had
to
use
the

service
yet,
but
it's
nice
to
know
it's
there.
The

were
very
well
packed,

as

I
ordered
a
Hella
replacement
headlight
for
my
car.
PartsGeek.com
shipped
a
TYC
brand
headlight
for
a
car
other
than
mine,
packaged
in
a
Hella
box
labeled
with
the
correct
part
number.
PartsGeek.com
does
not
accept
customer
service
phone
calls,
however
they
did
issue
a
RMA
for
the
item
through
their
online
ticket
system.
They
did
not
issue
a
shipping
label,
so
I'm
left
to
ship
the
incorrect
item
back
on
my
dime,
and
hope
that
they
refund
the
original
purchase
price.

Using
TransferWise
has
changed
the
way
I
move
money
internationally.

Whilst
some
banks
offer
very
low
fees,
the
rate
of
exchange
they
use
is
never
in
your
favour.

TranferWise
obviously
make
a
margin,
but
nowhere
near
as
steep
as
the
banks
and
I
have
always
been
pleased
with
the
deal.

Through
my
own
fault
I
made
an
error
with
an
IBAN
number,
which
TransferWise
spotted
and
helped
obtain
the
correct
one.

Having
an
email
exchange
with
a
professional
person
makes
for
great
relations.
Wave
goodbye
to
your
bank
for
transfers!

I

You
can't

Dear
friend,
when
I
realized
your
first
month
$1
promotion
was
a
sham,
I
no
longer
liked
your
company.
It
did
appear
that
you
have
hired
your
employees
based
on
a
1$
salary.
Not
impressed
and
I
am
pretty
sure
the
office
help
was
under
the
influence
of
something.
Lastly
your
roof
leak
all
over
my
unit,
having
to
unload
all
of
my
items
again
and
you
offered
no
compensation.
Since
buying
two
Audi
A4's
I
have
found
PartsGeek
to
be
a
great
friend.
They
have
a
wide
selection
of
parts
and
everything
has
been
of
great
quality.
I
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
their
on-line
system
and
it
always
seems
that
the
parts
show
up
faster
than
I
expect.
Easytobook
is
just
that
-
easy
to
book!
They
had
the
BEST
price
on
the
hotel
I
was
looking
for
and
I
searched
ALL
the
other
sites
that
supposedly
can
give
you
the
best
rate.
But
it
wasn't
true...Easytobook
was
the
ONLY
ONE
to
have
the
BEST
RATE!
Thank
you
-
see
you
again
soon
Easytobook!
I
will
use
them
again
Very
happy
with
parts
and
shipping.

you
ask
for.
Having
ordered
many

online,
often
I
have
been

the

We
will
be
back
with
another
project
next
week.
The
staff
of
GiftCards.com
and
particularly
their
associates
at
Wolfe.com
were
very
courteous
and
prompt
in
trying
to
help
me
resolve
a
situation
purchasing
a
virtual
gift
card
for
myself.
And
even
though
there
were
some
technical
issues
that
ultimately
prevented
me
using
the
gift
card
on
a
selling
website,
this
was
no
reflection
on
the
attentive
level
of
customer
service
I
received
from
the
support
staff
at
GiftCards.com
and
Wolfe.com.
This
is
by
far
the
best
supplement
store
i
have
ever
came
across
on,
they
are
very
competitive
with
pricing
and
the
fact
that
they
are
willing
to
provide
you
a
discount
for
choosing
them
instead
of
the
competitor
is
awesome,
thanks
again.
Thank
you
for
your

You

Very
easy
to
set
up
and
create
a

with
jAlbum,
but
because
of
the

at
times
there
isn't
very
much
cohesion
in
some
of
the
settings.
Things
you
can
change
or
modify
in

skin
can't
be
done
in
another,
or
must
be
done
using
different
setting
parameters.
Tightening
up
and
creating
more
universal
setting
options
in
the
core
software
would
help
very
much
in
creating
slideshows
and
changing
out
skins
more
easily.

This
was
an
important
consideration,
since
I
had
a
car
that
was
sitting
in
the
driveway,
going
nowhere
until
I
got
it
fixed.
The
price
was
right,
the
fit
was
right,
and
I
got
it
quick.
I'm
cool
with
that!
Cracking

Very
professional
staff
and
a
great
experience.

Qinne
was
extremely
helpful
on
the
phone
and
in
person
when
I
got
to
the
store.

Mario
was
the
service
technician
and
equally
professional
and
has
a
great
personality.

Qinne
gave
me
a
number
of
tire
options,
quoted
prices,
explained
the
pros/cons
of
each
and
then
offered
totals.

Mario
said
it
would
be
about
20
minutes
and
he
was
on
the
money.

I
drove
about
30
miles
from
the
Bronx
to
specifically
go
to
Town
Fair;
a
friend
uses
the
one
in
Milford
and
suggested
I
try
to
Stamford
site
when
I
couldn't
get
recommendations
for
any
place
locally.

I
hope
I
don't
need
to
go
back
anytime
soon,
but
if
I
need
to
I
will.

I
have
already
told
10
people
how
great
you
guys
are
and
encourage
them
to
make
the
trip
to
the
Bronx
to
see
them.
I
purchased
a
9
inch
tablet
for
my
7
year
old
grandson
a
few
months
ago.
He
always
hung
on
to
that
tablet
where
ever
he
went.
The
other
day
my
daughter
called
me
and
said,
your
grandson
was
getting
out
of
his
truck,
which
is
a
big
raised
up
4x4
and
he
dropped
it.
It
landed
on
the
concrete
sidewalk
with
a
thump,
and
the
case,
the
screen,
all
the
buttons
were
broken.
So
this
tablet
was
totaled.
He
was
a
very
unhappy
7
year
old.
I
talked
to
him
on
the
phone
and
said
I
have
purchased
a
replacement
warranty
from
Square
Trade
which
also
has
Accident
coverage
and
that
I
would
get
him
a
new
Table
soon.
I
hung
up
with
him
and
called
Square
Trade.
A
customer
service
rep
answered
and
we
talked,
he
said
since
your
item
is
totaled,
he
sent
me
a
return
label
and
said
he
would
be
refunding
the
total
amount
paid
to
my
PayPal
account
as
soon
as
I
shipped
the
item
as
they
see
when
it
was
shipped.
I
packaged
up
the
tablet
and
gave
it
to
FedX
to
ship.
By
the
time
I
returned
home,
I
received
an
email
from
Square
Trade
telling
me
my
refund
was
complete.
I
check
PayPal
and
it
was
there
and
ready
to
use.
So
I
ordered
him
a
new
table
and
also
purchased
a
new
Square
Trade
warranty
again.
I've
ordered
both
apparel
and
health
items
from
on
nit.
Hope
to
do
more
business
with
them
in
the
future
I
ordered
lenses
with
WeLoveLenses
after
finding
out
how
cheap
they
were
compared
to
the
Optician
equivalent
I
was
buying.
Despite
the
price
difference
the
service
was
fantastic
and
extremely
easy
to
use.
Before
I
made
the
order
I
called
and
spoke
t
o
a
gentleman,
Abraham
who
was
very
helpful
in
assisting
me
with
my
selection.

He
recommended
something
that
would
serve
me
with
the
lens
currently
on
the
camera
and
with
a
larger
lens
I
use
as
well.

He
also
noted
that
it
was
currently
on
sale
so
i
could
save
some
money.

Best
combination
for
me.
I
ordered
the
exhaust
headers
for
my
6.0
and
I
had
an
idea
for
using
a
v
band
clamp
system
to
attach
my
y
pipes
together
instead
of
the
flange
and
bolt
system.
I
ran
it
past
one
of
the
guys
at
MKM
and
he
made
sure
that
what
I
asked
for
was
done.
They
had
them
made
and
shipped
out
to
the
shop
the
next
week.
MKM
Customs
won't
have
any
complaints
from
me,
now
or
in
the
future.
It
does
as
it
says,
Speedy
service,
quality
products.
Highly
recommended.
your

is
so
easy
and

value

cheapest
by

A
fabulous
group
of
people
who
could
not
do
more
for
you.
I
would
recommend
them
to
anybody
who
loves
whisky
at
a
good
price.
Excellent
company.
I'd
definitely
buy
from
them
again,

(incorrect

I
needed
a
sensor
part
for
my
PT
Cruiser.

I
found
the
part
on
PartsGeek.com.

I
ordered
it
and
they
said
it
would
be
here
in
4
days,
and
it
got
here
in
3.

The
part
fit,
it
fixed
my
car.

They
sent
emails
to
tell
me
the
order
was
confirmed,
then
when
it
shipped
it,
and
finally
I
got
a
follow
up
email.

That
is
everything
you
want
in
a
parts
place:
In-stock,
confirmation,
timely
delivery,
and
it
fit
perfectly.
So
nice
to
have
somewhere
comfortable
to
relax
whilst
waiting
for
the
work
to
be
done.
Free
coffee
and
wi-fi
to
boot.
The
viewing
area
allowed
you
to
see
the
work
being
carried
out
and
seeing
a
clean,
tidy
and
organised
workshop
inspires
confidence.
The
Post
Office
called
at
06:20
on
that
Friday
morning
as
scheduled.

I
work
on
Friday,
Saturday,&
Sunday.

I
didn't
have
anyone
available
to
pick
up
the
bees
on
Friday
but
did
have
someone
to
pick
the
up
on
Saturday.

I
installed
them
that
evening
after
8:00
PM
when
I
got
home.

The
installment
went
very
smoothly.

I
only
wish
I
had
a
couple
of
frames
with
comb
to
get
them
off
to
a
good
start.

Overall
I'm
very
happy
with
my
purchase,


Thanks,

Cooke
Cover
is
great
and
light

The
solar
cover
attachment
kit
came
without
instructions.

Fortunately
I
have
had
previous
experience
installing
this
type
of
kit.

Someone
doing
this
for
the
first
time
may
have
difficulty.
I
placed
my
order
on
a
Wednesday
and
the
package
arrived
Saturday.
Can't
beat
that.....
I
have
ordered
several
times
from
FlashBay
and
will
do
so
again.
Great
color
matching,
service,
and
support.
The
service
I
received
was
first
class,
the
website
was
easy
to
navigate
and
I
quickly
found
what
I
was
looking
for.

The
item
arrived
within
a
couple
of
days
and
was
exactly
as
it
had
been
described
on
the
website.

An
all
round,
excellent
service,
a
pleasure
to
deal
with.
I
ordered
windshield
wipers
for
my
car
and
they
were
incorrect.
They
weren't
the
right
ones
and
while
the
company
was
kind
enough
to
refund
the
price
of
the
part
I
got
stuck
paying
postage
both
ways.
It's
not
fair.
I
trusted
the
company.
I
bought
their
offered
product
in
good
faith
and
I'm
out
money
for
no
other
reason
than
trusting
that
the
part
they
listed
as
the
correct
part
was
the
correct
part.
It
wasn't.
I'm
done
dealing
with
this
company.
Fool
me
once...
I
want
to
tell
you
of
a
caring
car
dealer
named
Auto
Lenders
of
Lakwood.

On
top
of
All
this
caring
came
a
great
deal
on
my
2011
Jeep
Wrangler.

My
salesperson
,
Anthony
could
not
do
enough
to
walk
me
thru
the
purchasing
process.


This
is
my
third
vehicle
thru
Auto
lenders.
At
one
time,
large
mail
order
photographic
suppliers
didn't
exactly
have
sterling
reputations
for
honesty
and
service.
However,
B&H
Photo
changed
all
that!
Fast
and
honest.
The
prices
are
competitive--especially
when
you
consider
that
you
will
be
treated
fairly.
Was
very
impressed
with
the
pricing
for
both
the
non
genuine
and
genuine
toner
cartridges
for
my
printer.
I
bought
32g
usb
drive
for
girlfriends
pics/vids
and
music
and
she
is
delighted
with
it.
After
using
my
usual
hotel
for
the
past
4
years
arranging
transfers
which
included
mini
bus
drop
offs
at
various
hotels
I
did
some
research
and
came
across
Suntransfers
offering
a
far
better
rate
but
also
in
a
private
cab
for
our
personal
use,
both
journeys
to
and
from
the
airport
were
first
class
and
when
we
arrange
our
flights
for
next
year
I
will
certainly
book
with
Suntransfers
again.

It

Thanks
I'm
6'6"
tall
and
when
I
have
to
work
on
my
motorcycle,
I
feel
like
I'm
standing
on
my
head!.

Recently
I
purchased
a
motorcycle
jack
from
stockwise.

I'ts
soo
nice
to
work
on
and
around
my
motorcycle
and
be
able
to
reach
areas
on
the
bike
with
some
degree
of
comfort.
All
the
best.I
got
what
I
ordered
on
time.
All
the
rotors
and
the
rear
brake
pads
worked
perfectly
and
the
price
was
fantastic.
The
front
brake
pads
are
nowhere
close
to
the
right
part.
I
double
checked
that
I
ordered
the
right
one,
and
I
did
but
the
pads
did
not
fit.
I
had
to
run
to
the
store
and
pay
full
price
for
pads
because
I
had
everything
off.
So
I
was
only
75%
satisfied
with
my
purchase.
It
also
took
a
while
for
the
parts
to
ship.
Mazuma
were
true
to
their
word.
I
had
a
delay
is
the
delivery
due
to
the
Christmas
public
holiday
to
which
I
notified
Mazuma.
They
honored
their
price
even
after
the
offer
was
expired.
I
will
definitely
deal
with
them
again
if
the
need
arises
and
urge
anyone
thinking
of
doing
so
to
do
so.
Delivery
was
quick
and
I
was
surprised
at
the
quality
of
the
packing.
Nothing
but
great
service.
In
my
first
order
Ive
got
a
little
problem,
but
they
were
very
fast
and
efficient
to
resolve
it.
Since
then,
everything
has
gone
very
good.
Thanks

I
have
the

and
have

the

date
online
with
no

Only
complaint
(not
PetFlow's
fault)
is
that
on
two
deliveries
the
package
was
left
on
the
front
stoop
in
the
pouring
rain,
so
that
the
box
disintegrated
when
I
picked
it
up.

All
they
had
to
do
was
take
one
more
step
and
put
the
package
under
a
covered
porch.

Not
PETFLOW's
fault
but
they
don't
know
how
to
fix
it.

Highly
recommend
Petflow.

I
ordered
dog
food
from
Chewy.com
when
I
found
it
very
difficult
to
find
the
brannd
and
flavor
most
appreciated
by
my
best
friend.

Their
website
was
friendly
and
placing
the
order
was
a
breeze.
I
have
had
many
labels
printed
on
demand
and
they
all
looked
like
crap.
So
I
decided
to
give
you
a
try.
I
ordered
only
a
few.
WOW
what
a
surprise
they
came
back
perfect.
As
a
designer
I
know
how
to
make
a
great
design,
but
most
on
demand
printing
processes
are
no
better
than
a
rubber
stamp.
Your
printed
rendition
of
my
design
is
stellar.
More
importantly
it
make
my
beer
now
look
like
a
professional
product.
I
will
be
coming
back
for
the
next
round
shortly.
Thank
you
for
the
quality
work.
No
issues,
highly
recommended.
We
already
had
a
safari
in
South
Africa
we
bid
on
at
an
auction.
So
I
was
researching
other
options
to
add
on
to
the
trip.
I
contacted
Jacada
travel
online
and
Sam
immediately
reached
out
to
me.
She
was
so
friendly
and
helpful
in
helping
us
put
together
our
itinerary.
Within
just
a
few
days
we
had
everything
put
together
for
an
amazing
trip.
She
recommended
the
most
amazing
places
to
stay
and
the
best
tours.
When
we
arrived
everything
was
taken
care
of
including
our
transportation.
It
was
such
a
relief
not
having
to
worry
about
the
details.
The
trip
was
absolutely
amazing
and
everything
went
according
to
plan.
A
truly
memorable
trip
that
we
are
still
talking
about
months
later.
I
cannot
recommend
Jacada
travel
and
Sam
enough.
Thanks
for
the
trip
of
a
lifetime!
This
course
has
been
amazing
and
eye
opening.
As
a
photographer
working
towards
a
professional
career
and
business
the
formation
and
pearls
of
wisdom
given
has
been
indeed
priceless.
Not
to
technical
that
it's
over
my
head
and
not
to
simplistic
that
I
can't
"talk
shop"
with
other
photographers
and
camera
merchants.
This
program
has
helped
open
up
a
new
door
for
me
a
new
opportunity
use
gifts
and
talents
that
God
has
blessed
me
with
to
provide
for
my
family.......thank
you
all
so
very
much.
Some
videos
of
instruction
or
videos
of
demonstrations
would
be
extremely
helpful.
It
would
help
break
up
a
bit
of
the
monotony
of
going
through
the
slides,
maybe
at
the
very
least
some
read
along
audio
of
the
course
being
narrated
of
sorts.
Thanx!
If
you
want
to
find
that
special
pen
or
pencil,
try
Cult
Pens!
Was
a

worried
after
reading
some
reviews
and
being

IFLORIST.

and
were

Well

Great

Packed

After
dealing
with
many
places
for
many
years
I
decided
to
try
Parts
Geek
because
of
an
item
that
I
needed
which
was
priced
extremely
low
compared
to
everyone
else.

I
placed
my
order

not
knowing
what
to
expect

but
was
really
surprised

at
how
easy
the
process
was
from
placing
the
order
to
delivery.

You
also
have
the
option
between
original
and
aftermarket
on
many
parts.

They
seem
to
have
just
about
every
single
part
for
your
car
in
stock.
If
you
are
looking
for
the
best
deals
possible
on
all
parts
for
your
car,
Parts
Geek
should
be
your
only
choice.
So
far
I
have
ordered
an
AC
compressor,
Struts,
Shocks,
Control
Arms,
absolutely
zero
complains.
Parts
Geek
is
a
Must!
I've
been
watching
Swiss
Luxury
from
a
distance
for
a
few
years
now
and
finally
decided
to
use
them
to
buy
a
new
Rolex
as
a
gift
for
my
wife.

I'm
really
happy
with
all
aspects.

I'll
definitely
use
them
for
future
purchases.

Thanks
so
much!
When
I
need
to
review
a
topic,
study
a
subject.
or
find
a
product,
I
have
never
gone
wrong
using
google.

it
has
what
I
need.
When
my
local
gym
started
raising
the
prices
of
the
supplements
I
was
buying
from
them,
I
became
curious
as
to
what
price
others
were
selling
the
same
products.

I
went
to
GNC
and
checked
their
prices
to
find
that
they
were
as
expensive,
if
not
more
expensive,
than
my
local
gym.

I
had
decided
I
would
just
buy
from
the
gym
until
I
ran
across
an
advertisement
for
the
Supplement
Warehouse.

Their
pricing
was
almost
half
of
what
both
the
gym
and
GNC
were
charging.

I'm
no
genius,
(haha,
I'm
a
lifter,
remember)
but
I
figured
there
had
to
be
a
catch.

However,
for
these
prices,
I
was
going
to
see
for
myself
if
it
was
real
or
not.

After
my
first
order
I
was
convinced
I
had
found
the
real
deal;
even
more
when
I
got
free
trials
of
products
and
a
Muscle
and
Fitness
Magazine
to
boot.

I
love
this
place
and
will
continue
to
be
a
customer
unless
the
government
puts
free
enterprise
out
of
business.

Let's
roll
entrepreneurs.

Keep
America
free,
God
fearing,
and
STRONG!!!!
The
title
says
it
all,
the
new
shifters
I
bought
were
a
good
10%
cheaper
than
the
sale
price
on
another
popular
cycle
website,
the
product
was
in
stock,
I
ordered
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
and
it
was
on
my
doorstep
by
9:00am
Tuesday.
Fantastic
service
def
be
using
again
in
the
future.
I
can't
wait
to
use
the
honey
I
purchased
along
with
the
shaker
bottle
from
Onnit.
I
ordered
on
Monday
and
FedEx
arrived
Thursday,
but
they
had
sent
Windows
XP
Pro
instead.
A
Quick
call
and
the
saleslady
said
she
would
take
care
of
it.
The
following
Tuesday
FedEx
arrived
with
the
correct
product.
I
would
recommend
this
product
as
well
as
capital
pc
We
spent
time
reading
reviews
and
looking
for
best
deals
on
long
stay
parking
.
It
was
easy
to
use,
and
we
got
4
star
accommodations
at
2-3
star
prices.
I
had
"BEAST
MODE"
done
in
3"
lettering.
They
were
fast
and
very
professional.

If
you
need
anything
give
them
a
shot.
I
will
use
them
again.
I
received
a
hard
to
find
product
and
received
it
quickly.

I
will
definitely
order
from
them
again.
Amazing
prices
and
fast
shipping!
If
your
going
to
buy

buy

The

and

the

i
have
had
from
any
online
supplier.
had
problems
with
my
first
order
but
they
were
happy
to

and
quickly

Asked
for

Did
not

Yo,

found
a

on
a

You

Love
it.

Ordering
with
B&H
was
STOOOPID
SIMPLE.
The
pricing
on
the
technical
book
I
ordered
was
excellent
even
though
the
book
is
rare.

Shipping
was
timely,
and
the
order
was
processed
as
expected.
I
would
like
a
refund
for
my
room
at
the
Manguson
Hotel
in
Elberton,
GA
for
Friday,
3/22/14.

The
hotel
is
a
disgrace
and
filthy.
Not
only
is
this
service
entirely
over
priced
for
what
it
is,
they
are
not
24
hours
and
institute
ridiculous
late
fees
with
no
grace
period.
The
only
reason
I'm
not
giving
this
one
star
is
because
they
do
offer
insurance,
and
by
offer
I
mean
require,
and
I
feel
my
stuff
is
safe
and
dry.
I
got
my
pc
and
from
statup
it
worked
fine
although
I
haven't
really
pushed
it
with
any
games
or
programs
yet
I
am
pretty
sure
it
will
run
fine!
top
class
people
at
ginger

will
buy
from
them
again
Thank
you
for
your
concern.
I'm
very
happy
with
my
recent
acquisition
from
you.
Everything
fit
fine
for
my
96
Dodge
2500
diesel
except
for
the
fan
cowling.
For
some
reason
my
cowling
when
placed
on
this
new
radiator
was
displaced
to
the
driver's
side
by
about
1".

Had
to
make
an
offset
bracket
for
the
passenger
side
tab
at
the
bottom,
then
I
had
to
drill
new
holes
in
the
cowling
to
mount
it
to
the
radiator.

By
doing
this,
the
fan
was
centered
in
the
cowl
and
would
go
around
without
hitting
the
cowl.
I
was
very
hesitant
about
finding
a
reputable
online
pharmacy.

After
many
many
attempts
on
locating
one,

I
came
across
Access
Rx,
and
I
gave
them
a
try.
The
word
"pleased"
cannot
describe
my
experience.
..much
better,

in
fact.

The
customer
service
representive
and
the
medical
staff
were
friendly
and
efficient.
I
was
obtaining
a
prescription
for
Calais
and
did
not
have
my
own
doctor.


I
didn't
feel
in
any
way
uncomfortable,

rushed
or
like
I
was
doimg
or
dealing
with
anything
shady.

My
medication
arrived
exactly
when
they
said
it
would.
The
refill
process
is
easy.

I
am
very
happy
with
this
company
and
will
continue
to
use
them.
The
only
drawback
I
can
mention
is
that
the
medication
is
a
bit
pricey
but
it
includes
the
prescription
and
the
consultation.

Access
Rx
is
professional,
efficient
and
certainly
reputable.


I
highly
rrecommend!
I
am
happy
with
the
facility.
I
do
have
one
issue...
I
am
in
a
climate
control
facilty
unit
and
every
time
I
have
gone
to
my
unit
it
is
extremely
hot
inside
the
building.
I
would
like
this
looked
into.

Had
an
issue
with
my
glasses,
but
they
fixed
it
and

very
well.
Would

Great

Shine
bright
and
low

Fast

,
great
customer
service
,
reasonable
prices,
free
shipping
for
most
of

I
have
always
received
prompt
delivery
of
items
and
they
have
a
good
range
of
printer
inks
at
a
competive
price.
My
only
drawback
is
the
5-6
packages
you
receive
with
the
ink
individually
wrapped
-
not
good
for
our
environment
Supplied
the

I
wanted

much
better

anticipated
and
simple

well
done

I
will
use
you
again!
BLT

me
sound
advice
on
the
type
of

to

and
I
was

than
happy
with
the

supplied.
Efficient
in
both
supplying
the

the

Will

We

4

We
were

a

only
8

The
car
performed
flawlessly
as
we

Great

Great

SUPER

SERVICE!
I
enjoy
shopping
online
with
B&H
because
it
is
easy
as
well
as
quick
and
convenient.

I
also
know
if
i
have
questions,
the
answer
is
only
a
phone
call
away.
Geen

I
am
a
fan
of
the
Easyclip
brand
and
I
have
been
using
them
for
years.

Frames
direct
has
a
great
selection
of
these
and
this
is
the
second
time
I
buy
from
them.

This
time
was
the
best
because
they
have
a
style
that
doesn't
follow
the
trend
of
smaller
frames
!

I
got
some
old
fashioned
ray
ban
style
and
ordered
them
on
discount.

Fast
shipping
and
processing
and
great
customer
service!

I
recommend
everyone
to
buy
frames
here.
I
order
material
from
these
guys.

Like
the
1-liner
says...Great
prices,
great
delivery
lead-times,
great
service.

Top
notch
company
here.

I
received
the
correct
part
in
3
days,
no
hassle,
no
issues.
I
applied
for
a
loan,
got
accepted,
completed
the
contract
and
selected
faster
payments
at
a
huge
cost
of
£15
extra.

At
16:15
I
received
a
text
saying
that
the
money
had
been
sent
but
still
nothing
has
appeared
in
my
account.

I
have
used
a
number
of
payday
lenders
and
every
time
I
have
received
the
funds
within
30
mins
without
a
problem.
Part
was
listed
on
their
site,
yet
when
I
ordered
it
and
payed
in
good
faith,
got
an
email
saying
it
was
not
longer
available.

They
should
remove
parts
listings
if
they
cannot
provide
them.
I
have
been
very
pleasd
with
the
quality
of
all
the
16x20
and
20x24
artwork
I
have
bought
(several)
and,
when
framed,
in
the
quality
and
workmanship
of
the
framing.
I
tried
one
of
the
budget
items
for
a
less
important
location,
and
must
say
it
was
of
decidedly
lower
quality.
I
would
never
buy
another.
On
the
other
hand,
I
have
bought
a
few
8x10's
which
were
not
advertised
as
economy
but
which
turned
out
to
be
lacking
in
any
depth
of
paint
just
as
was
the
larger
item.
I
don't
think
the
8x10's
are
any
bargain
at
full
price
but
on
sale
may
be
worth
a
look
for
a
special
spot..
frames
have
all
been
very
good
but
occasionally
the
stretching
could
be
tighter
to
match
my
preference.
All
in
all,
a
good
source
but
could
use
a
wider
choice
of
artists.
I
have
installed
two
of
these
packages
from
Costco,
one
for
me
and
one
for
my
sister-in-law.
The
second
installation
went
very
smoothly.
I
had
a
few
problems
with
the
first
though.
The
Z
wave
lamp
modules
would
not
connect
with
the
2
gig
controller
and
I
had
to
have
them
replaced.
I
also
had
to
replace
one
of
the
door
window
sensors
which
had
a
broken
case
when
it
arrived.
With
the
door
window
sensor
replacement
I
was
given
the
instruction
sheet
on
how
to
program
it
into
the
2
gig
controller.
Which
by
the
way
they
do
not
send
the
programming
sheet
for
the
sensors
since
they
pre
install
them
before
they
send
you
the
package.
At
least
now
I
have
the
programming
instructions
for
the
door
window
sensors
if
I
decide
to
change
any
parameters
such
as
entry
alarm
delay
etc.
in
the
program.
That
is
my
one
and
only
gripe
about
this
system
is
they
do
not
send
the
actual
programming
instructions
for
all
the
devices.
Maybe
its
proprietary
or
something
and
they
have
their
reasons
I
guess.
Overall
it
is
a
very
good
system
and
we
have
already
set
off
the
alarms
inadvertently
and
had
the
local
Sheriff
show
up
twice
to
our
house.
It
does
help
to
remember
to
you
now
have
a
security
system
that
will
call
law
enforcement
for
you
when
you
forget
to
disarm
the
system.
The
automation
devices
are
great
and
I
love
the
fact
that
I
now
have
an
alarm
that
will
call
the
fire
department
when
the
smoke
detector
goes
off
when
I
am
away
from
home.
Order
was
placed
over
a
week
ago
and
per
UPS
Tracker,
shipped
out
Monday
June
9.

All
indication
was
that
it
would
be
delivered
in
advance
of
Father's
Day.

Instead,
the
shippment
was
delayed
while
in
transit
and
did
not
show
up
until
today,
Monday
June
16th,
a
full
week
later.

The
cooler
had
no
ice
in
it
(or
the
dry
ice
had
evaporated?),
the
meat
was
unfrozen
and
soggy,
and
blood
was
on
the
bottom
of
the
cooler.

This
just
happened
hours
ago
when
this
review
option
popped
up,
so
I
am
drafting
this
almost
in
real
time.

I
have
not
yet
contacted
the
company
to
determine
next
steps
as
this
is
unacceptable.

We
are
hopefully
that
the
situation
will
be
remedied
in
a
reasonable
and
timely
fashion.
This

Only

I've
heard
it
so
many
times
but
the
BookaTrack

is
a

good

and
it
shows
on
the
track
compared
to
other

not

I
used

Can't

Haven't
got

But
this
is
a
great

I
recieved
my
order
quicker
than
expected
so
I
was
not
in
when
the
delivery
arrived
but
the
driver
concealed
the
parcel
and
put
a
card
through
the
door
pointing
out
where
it
was.
I
always
look
at

I
have
been
taking

not

It
would
be
great
to
have

build
up
credit
for
free

and/or
incentives
to
try
other
products
in
the
small
(but
larger
than
sample)
sizes.

The
free
samples
are
very
much
appreciated
as
well,
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
determine
if
the
product
has
an
affect
after
2
day
(4

size).

that

It
wasn't.

i
have
been
using
them
for
a
long
time,
and
have
always
been
happy
with
the
services.
Basically
i
do
a
lot
of
online
shopping
but
country
attire
have
given
me
the
best
service
so
far,
my
item
was
with
me
in
two
days...
from
ordering,
to
getting
it
in
my
hand.
Couldnt
of
wished
for
better
service,
considering
it
was
3
or
4
days
before
christmas!
Cant
compliment
them
highly
enough!
Very
Good
Company,
FULL
STOP!
I
contacted
wageme
filled
in
on
line
application
amazed
at
quick
approval
and
very
quick
payout
would
certainly
recommend
this
company
over
any
other
payday
lender

Great
place
to
find
what
ever
part
you
need,
and
at
a
good
price.
Delivery
time
was
also
great.
I've
purchase
twice
now
same
part
(expansion
tank)
first
one
crack
on
me,
i
bought
a
second
one.
Hopefully
this
one
doesn't
crack
either?
Was
way
less
than
all
other
retailers,delivery
within
a
week
I
had
been
searching
locally
for
a
3.6v
lithium
AA
battery
for
my
dive
computer
without
luck.

I
ordered
3
from
BuyaBattery
and
was
amazed
when
they
arrived
the
following
day
and
at
a
great
price
too!
I
found
the
website
to
be
very
informative
and
easy
to
navigate,
with
a
good
range
of
products
available.
Great
site,
so
easy
to
get
a
quote
and
place
an
order,
have
not
yet
found
anywhere
else
that
can
sell
oil
for
a
lower
price.
Very
appreciative
of
their
excellent
customer
service.

They
have
a
niche
market
of
well
produced
products
for
pets.

Will
use
them
again.
Great
prices
and
great
parts
Thanks
great
website,
i'll
be
sure
to
use
them
again!
I
have
a
rental
that
requires
an
odd
size
A/C
filter
which
I
can
never
find
so
I
order
them
from
Air
Filters
Delivered
which
has
every.
Size
available.
I
have
ordered
several
screens
now
for
various
devices
and
haven't
had
any
issues
with
my
orders.

I'm
quite
happy
with
the
products
I've
purchased
and
I
would
absolutely
recommend
ScreenCountry
to
others.
I
bought
my
frames
on
eBay
for
much
cheaper.


I
then
sent
my
frames
in
the
prepaid
box
to
Lens
Factory.

The
representative
was
excellent
and
fun.

The
process
was
easy
and
my
glasses
are
great.
Good
weatherproof
leggings
at
a
very
good
price
delivered
quickly
and
with
no
fuss.
The
Wizard's
Sleeve
flavour
is
unusual
and
tasty
and
has
something
of
the
artichoke
or
the
asparagus
about
it.
I'll
be
trying
it
again
I
think
but
I
will
also
be
looking
around
for
more
bargains
online.
We
were
very
happy
with
our
order
!
Pleasant

order
over
phone..


Fast
delivery!!!!

Thanks!!!!!!!!!
I
like
supplement
warehouse
because
it
has
the
cheapest
supplements
I
have
found
on
the
internet.
The
only
thing
that
would
bump
them
up
to
a
five
is
if
they
started
carrying
more
of
the
top-brand-supplements.
Even
though
I
say
this,
a
lot
of
the
not-as-popular
products
have
the
same
or
even
better
effects!
I
will
definitely
be
continuing
to
shop
here.
You
can
be
confident
the
you
will
always
get
a
first
class
service
from
Brian's
team!
I
only
order
from
two
places
online
for
my
moto
needs
and
becasue
STG
is
so
legit
it
is
the
first
one
I
go
to
first.
I
recomend
this
company
today
resive
my
order
and
l
save
hundreds
of
dollars
thanks
1000.
I
wanted
a
hotel
in
Durham
NH
and
it
booked
me
a
hotel
in
Durham
NC.
I
realized
it
right
away
and
canceled
it.
Since
I
canceled,
it's
been
almost
3
days
and
Haven't
received
my
169$!!!!,
a
phone
call,
e-mail
or
anything
besides
this
survey.
I've
tried
to
call
them
but
no
one
answers
and
email
is
always
"forbidden"
at
this
time.
So
I
hope
this
will
get
someone's
attention.
The
service
from
Flashbay
was
great.
Quick
and
accurate
visuals
of
the
drive
with
logo
and
prompt
delivery
of
the
order
in
a
busy
time
over
Christmas.
Good
value
and
a
smooth
experience.
Will
definitely
recommend
and
use
again.
My
experience
with
Great
Resumes
Fast
was
not
exceptional.
I
was
initially
assigned
to
a
resume
writer
in
the
Midwest
(I
am
in
CA)
who
missed
both
of
our
scheduled
appointments.
I
complained/she
bowed
out,
and
I
was
reassigned
to
another
writer
in
CA.
I
felt
the
first
draft
I
received
after
our
phone
interview
was
wordy
and
the
stats
I
had
provided
were
not
accurately
presented.
I
responded
with
a
fairly
extensive
edit,
all
of
which
was
incorporated
in
the
final
draft.
I
would
say
that
the
final
product
and
cover
letter
were
ultimately
acceptable,
but
time
will
tell
what
responses
I
receive.
Easy
and
priced
right.
Receipt
in
three
days,
you
got
to
love
it.
I
have
had
issues
in
the
past
with
customer
service
and
with
getting
the
correct
parts
shipped
to
me.
I
continue
to
order
from
MCM
because
they
always
fix
the
problems.
I
had
an
issue
once
when
they
took
weeks
to
respond,
but
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
was
an
anomaly.
My
most
recent
interaction
was
speedy
and
pleasant.
I've
heard
of
Partsgeek
before
but
never
had
a
reason
to
use
them.
Finally,
I
bought
a
1998
Dodge
Dakota
truck
for
my
son
that
needed
some
parts
that
I
thought
were
very
common.
I
was
wrong.
After
weeks
trying
to
find
the
proper
parts
to
no
avail,
I
remembered
Partsgeek.
Last
Tuesday
I
found
and
ordered
all
the
parts
needed
to
complete
the
project
from
Partsgeek.
By
Wednesday
evening
(within
22
hours)

all
parts
arrived
at
my
house.
Surprised
as
all
Hell.
Happy
as
all
Hell
too.
GOOD
SELECTIONS
AND
PRICING.
In
other
words
B&H
is
my
option
for
the
professional
stuff
that
I
buy.
Thanks
B&H
Great
stuff
at
affordable
prices.
Terrific
for
gifts,
too.
Try
it!
I
am
a
repeat
purchaser,
hesitant
at
first,
but
tried
the
product
anyway.
It
was
great.
Quick
delivery,
easy
and
secure
payment,
the
product
works
as
described.
No
need
to
buy
contact
lenses
through
my
optician
any
longer
as
this
is
quicker,
more
convenient
,
cheaper
and
less
hassle.
Opticians
are
for
eye
tests
only
.
We
booked
two
condos
at
Tidewater
through
Tripshock
three
weeks
ago.
Yesterday
they
called
to
tell
us
one
of
the
condos
was
no
longer
in
the

rental
pool
and
offered
to
move
part
of
our
family
two
miles
away
to
Splash
or
refund
our
money
on
the
one
condo.
No
other
resolution
was
offered.
Amy,
the
deliverer
of
the
bad
news,
suddenly
stopped
returning
calls
and
emails
and
we
are
desperately
looking
for
an
alternative
which
would
allow
our
two
groups
to
be
together--but
with
less
than
a
week
before
our
arrival,
there
is
little
hope
we
can
salvage
our
vacation.
Next
time,
we
will
book
through
another
agent.
Tripshock
customer
service
is
woefully
lacking.
Suggest
you
use
anyone
but
them.
Quick
service
at
an
agreed
price
but
no
more!
Cheapest
prices
I
found
online
and
calling
around,
easy
to
find
what
you
need
and
very
fast
delivery.
Great
selection
of
products
at
low
prices.
Shipping
is
super
fast.
I
am
a
new

but
have
researched

of
natural

for

at
various

have
found
no

that
offers
lower

Great

I

AS
a
first
time
user
of
Tire
Fair
I
was
treated
like
a
celebrity
by
Drew
who

handled
Having
my
clubs
shipped
instead
of
lugging
through
airports
is
the
best.
Shipsticks
did
exactly
what
they
promised.
There
was
a
change
in
plans
and
location
for
the
trip
back
and
Shipsticks
accommodated
without
a
problem.
I
will
never
lug
my
clubs
around
again.
The
cost
was
$49.99
each
way.
3
days
as
promised.
I
ordered
a
screen
for
an
Aspire
one
netbook
and
it
came
on
time
without
any
hang
up
or
hassle.
This
is
my
first
purchase
from

LaptopScreen.com,
I
am
sure
it
will
not
be
my
last.
Thanks
a
lot,
LaptopScreen.com.
yall
made
it
real
easy,
and
I
just
love
easy
:)
I
had
a
number
of
books
that
I
did
not
have
space
for,
but
did
not
want
to
get
rid
of
completely.
Boxbee
provided
me
with
a
simple
way
to
store
my
books
until
I
free
up
some
space,
and
I
appreciate
knowing
that
I
can
get
them
back
when
I
need
them.
Newark
Airport
LTP
delivered
service
with
a
smile.

All
expectations
were
met.

I
recommend
using
their
service
when
flying
out
of
Newark
Airport.
Fast
and
efficient.

Good
website.

Good
variety
with
some
rare
stuff.
2
of
my
3
orders
have
been
late
compared
to
the
information
given
at
the
order.
When
planning
our
pets
supplies,
being
given
incorrect
information
puts
a
bind
on
their
feedings.
The
closest
store
to
carry
the
Blue
products
we
buy
from
you
is
over
2
hours
round
trip,
so
when
I
have
to
do
the
drive
after
ordering
from
your
company,
it
is
not
very
good
customer
service.
If
the
correct
information
was
given
at
order
time,
the
planning
could
be
arranged
as
such.
Hopefully
this
does
not
happen
again,
as
it
is
very
disconcerning.
Vriendelijke
service
waarin
echt
meegedacht
wordt
met
de
klant.
it
was
very
fast
and
easy
fast,easy,convenient.
the
quality
of
the
product
is
excellent.
Also
the
product
came
the
time
period
that
the
internet
.site
said.
This
is
a
brilliant
website,
I've
bought
Company
of
Heroes
2
(pre-order
retail
edition
for
the
Commanders)
and
Black
Ops
II
(Pre-order
edition
for
the
extra
nuketown
DLC)
My
dog
is
blind
and
deaf.

Last
month
I
had
mailed
in
3
Rx's
for
his
eye
medications
with
4
refills
on
all
and
had
a
shipment
sent.

This
month
I
ordered
over
the
weekend
as
I
new
I
was
in
need
during
the
upcoming
week
of
refills.

I
paid
for
overnight
shipping
$20
extra.

I
get
an
email
that
I
dont
have
refills
and
my
Vet
will
need
to
be
contacted!

I
email
back
how
is
that
possible
as
I
have
refills!

I
get
a
response
the
next
day
that
he
didn't
look
"far
enough
back"
in
the
file
to
see
that
I
did
have
refills.

Unprofessional
and
uncaring
after
I
fully
explained
everything.

Except
now
He
says
they
don't
have
5mg
in
stock
and
since
the
refill
is
written
for
5mg
he
can't

send
10mg
and
charge
me
more
-
he
says
he
has
to
contact
my
vet
to
authorize
10mg!

Another
day
lost!

And
on
top
of
everything
my
order
gets
sent
out
USPS
regular
mail!

Received
5
days
later.

Terrible
customer
service!

Seriously
considering
going
to
1800PETMEDS
starting
with
my
next
refill.
A
comprehensive
range
of
products
and
first
class
service.
I
shall
certainly
use
these
people
again.
Very
prompt
and
reasonably
priced
service
even
for
a
relatively
small
order
value.
An
extremely
wide
range
of
writing
materials
at
reasonable
prices
and
from
my
experiences
a
fast
service.
I
didn't
want
next
day
delivery
so
opted
out
of
paying
an
extra
£10.
Result,
it
arrived
at
09:30
the
next
day.
Fantastic
but
who
is
ripping
off
tv
village
customers
with
this
£10
option?
I
have
used
USN
Diet
Fuel
for
a
long
time,
but
have
always
wondered
why
it
never
came
in
a
larger
container.
Thanks
to
an
email
from
MuscleFiness,
I
saw
the
2
kg
container.
The
price
was
unbelievable-cheaper
for
2kg
than
a
High
Street
store
charges
for
a
1kg.
The
delivery
too
was
prompt
and
delivered
to
work.
I'b
been
looking
for
a
broad
gel
refill
for
ages
in
the
shops
-
don't
like
thin
ones
-
and
failed
to
find
any.
Thought
-
aha!
the
internet
and
Cult
pens
came
up.
Not
only
did
they
have
the
merchandise,
but
it
was
easy
to
order
[unlike
some
places],
it
arrived
the
following
day
-
wow
-
andIi
got
a
free
pen
included
too.
Cannot
think
how
the
service
could
be
bettered.
I
will
use
them
again.
Thank
you
Cult
Pens!
the
person
handling
the
request
helped
me
through
the
entire
thing.
i
had
questions
while
filling
out
the
application
and
he
assisted
me
along
the
way.
i
received
a
note
just
after
getting
off
the
phone
stating
my
loan
was
not
approved,
i
called
back
and
he
looked
at
it
and
reassured
my
it
was
going
through.
i
received
the
funds
the
next
day.
There
was
a
hiccup
in
the
computer
resulting
in
a
duplicate
order
being
generated.
They
were
very
good,
getting
on
the
telephone
early
the
next
day
to
ascertain
what
I
wanted
and
the
order
was
dispatched
promptly.
Excellent
service
yet
again.
I
would
not
use
this
chemist
again.
The
order
hasn't
arrived
and
they
have
not
responded
to
my
request
for
assistance.
I
even
tried
phoning
the
0845
number
to
be
told
by
a
recorded
announcement
there
were
no
staff
available
to
deal
with
my
call.
Thank
you
for
an
excellent
website
-
so
easy
to
use
and
understand.
Also
for
the
quick
service
which
on
my
last
order
was
delivered
using
standard
delivery
just
the
next
working
day.
Wow!
I've
ordered
from
WCS
a
couple
of
times
now.

Always
receive
prompt
service,
competitive
prices,
great
selection,
and
great
products.

I
will
return
to
WCS
for
all
of
my
wet
shaving
needs.
For
the
amount
of
money
I
spend
on
camera
equipment
I
appreciate
having
technical
experts
that
can
answer
my
questions
about
the
use
of
the
equipment,
and
yet
still
receive
competitive
pricing
on
high
quality
products.
My
order
from
parts
geek
arived
and
exceded
what
i
expected.
Good
quality
and
correct
fit.
Thank
you
partsGeek.
Really
disappointed...
I
was
a
bit
suspicious
when
I
saw
the
price
but
t
hings
could
not
have
gone
better
-
I
was
notified
a
day
in
advance
as
I
requested
(not
sure
if

its
a
standard
feature).
We
live
in
a
tricky-to-find
place
but
my
instructions
must
have
been
given
to
the
driverr
because
he
did
a
great
job!
I
have
recommended
BoilerJuice
to
friends
and
will
do
again.

Thank
goodness
we
can
keep
toastie
this
winter
with
a
little
L£$$
concern!
Knowing
where
EXACTLY
to
meet
the
guys
at
Birmingham
airport
seemed
a
bit
of
a
lottery
until
you
found
there
was
only
one
large
light
post
in
the
drop
off
zone.
Paper
work
was
well
organised
for
departure
and
return.Getting
the
car
back
was
stress

free.
I'll
be
using
the
guys
again.
Our
experience
with
Doheny
has
been
nothing
short
of
outstanding!
Good
prices
and
prompt
deliveries
make
ordering
non-threating.
Great
service
thanks
You
drop
your
car
off
directly
outside
the
departure
terminal
and
the
chauffeur
deals
with
the
drop
off
in
moments
leaving
you
to
get
checked
in.
There's
none
of
this
parking
miles
away
and
then
waiting
for
shuttle
buses
which
adds
to
your
time
and
is
the
last
thing
you
want
on
your
return
trip
and
just
want
to
get
home.
Highly
recommended
hassle
free
airport
parking.
I
wouldn't
use
any
other
now.
Our
Ruvati
sink
and
faucet
combo
not
only
exceeded
our
expectations,
but
the
customer
service
provided
by
MainFaucet
was
superb!
Excellent
service.
All
prices
and
terms
carried
out
exactly
as
represented
up
front.
Beautiful
car,
too
This
was
perhaps
the
worst
customer
service
experience
I
have
ever
had
in
my
life.
I
was
able
to
order
my
fifth
wheel
hitch
easily.

I
had
a
question
about
the
rails
when
the
packages
arrived
so
I
called
American
RV
and
got
my
answer.

However,
a
few
days
later,
someone
called
me
to
verify
everything
was
good
with
my
shipment
which
was
nice.

The
Reese
hitch
price
was
cheaper
than
anyone
else
and
included
free
shipping
which
was
surprising
since
it
weighed
over
100
lbs.

All
the
right
pieces
were
there
and
the
hitch
is
installed
just
in
time
to
go
pickup
the
new
RV.

Very
good
experience
and
will
use
American
RV
again
in
the
future.
Excellent
range
of
products
and
getting
better
all
the
time.
The
clutch
I
bought
came
with
everything,
I
thought
it
didn't
come
with
a
slave
cylinder
but
it
did.
Parts
geeks

price
was
200
dollars
cheaper
than
advance
auto
and
i
have
a
discount
cuz
I
work
there.
Shipping
was
easy
to
track
also
Everything
but
the
website
search
is
as
good
as
it
gets.
Ordered
over
the
internet
-
A
-
O.K.
Merlin
Cycles
has
some
of
the
best
prices
I
have
found.
Ordered
a
y-pipe
converter
and
one
of
the
doughnut
gaskets
was
missing.
Service
response
was,
"gaskets
are
not
included."
No
explanation
of
the
two
gaskets
that
were.
Last
suggestion
was
to
return
the
entire
shipment.
WILL
NOT
use
PartsGeek
again.

We
are
really
pleased
with
the
marble
fire
place
that
Mick
produced
for
us
and
were
very
impressed
with
the
level
of
service
we
received.
Originally
we
were
happy
to
wait
for
the
3
week
lead
time
on
the
fire
place,
however
I
then
had
to
ask
Mike
if
he
could
speed
up
the
production,
after
speaking
with
him
on
the
Friday
pulled
out
all
the
stops
and
we
had
it
delivered
the
following
Wednesday.
We
purcahsed
a
large
extending
dining
room
table
6
leather
chairs
and
two
large
sideboards.
All
turned
up
on
time
well
packed
and
in
good
order.
Very
pleased
with
the
quality
and
would
happly
recommend
Oakfurnitureland.
Have
used
glasses
direct
before,
they
didn't
let
me
down
with
this
order,
even
though
I
have
a
fairly
complicated
prescription
the
glasses
arrived
within
a
week
of
my
order.
We
are
in
the
process
of
renovating
our
new
home
and
I
purchased
two
wall
lights
from
Castlegatelights
a
couple
of
months
ago.
Our
electrician
only
got
round
to
installing
them
last
week
and
realised
that
one
of
them
had
been
broken
in
transit.
As
this
was
well
outside
the
time
limit
for
returns
I
assumed
that
I
would
be
told
that
there
was
nothing
they
could
do,
fortunately
they
have
refunded
the
cost
of
the
original
light
and
the
replacement
arrived
within
48
hours
of
ordering.
I
purchased
apair
of
glasses
from
selectspecs
in
Febuary
this
year.
Unfortunately
in
September
one
of
the
arms
snapped
off,
on
contacting
the
company
and
after
sending
them
a
photo
of
the
broken
glasses
thay
agreed
to
provide
me
a
new
pair
of
the
same
glasses.
It
was
nice
to
deal
with
a
company
that
didn't
make
you
fight
for
what
was
right!
Great
communications,
rapid
delivery,
quality
product
and
a
discount
voucher
for
my
next
(assured)
purchase!
Couldn't
ask
for
more!
very
easy
booking,
very
good
price
and
close
to
the
airport,
just
what
a
family
needs,
will
definetly
use
again
and
again
Lots
of
variety,
good
quality,
reasonable
prices,
good
customer
service.
Very
easy
to
work
with
and
would
recommend
them
to
anyone.
No
issues
-
helpful
reviews
and
I
stayed
in
a
great
place
They
made
an
error
in
the
post
address
(I
have
a
weird
campus
address).
But
because
they
keep
you
so
well
informed
through
mail,
I
noticed
it
soon
enough.
I
mailed
them
directly
and
received
a
very
fast
reply
with
a
thank
you
note
and
telling
me
they
corrected
it.
Thanks
for
completing
our
order
in
record
time
my
card
had
only
just
got
put
back
in
my
wallet
and
my
orderwas
delivered.
Have
no
problem
in
recomending
your
company
if
only
the
rest
of
retail
worked
as
well
Thanks
once
again
Good
price,
professional
service,fast
shipping,
Definitely
You've
got
an
A+
as
a
Company.
Thank
you.

Loved
the
experience
with
PartsGeek.com.

It
was
fast
to
find
the
parts
and
order
them.

The
parts
got
here
on
time
and
as
expected.
the
web-site
for
placing
an
order
was
a
bit
difficult
and
I
had
trouble
with
my
credit
card
the
first
time.
then
the
second
time
forgot
the
delivery
address
was
different
from
the
billing
address
and
could
not
get
it
corrected,
so
I
had
to
cancel
the
order.
But
the
third
time
I
got
it
right!!!
I
have
used
PartsGeek.com
for
several
projects
on
two
different
vehicles.
Their
products
are
quality
and
the
price
is
right.
I
had
some
minor
fit
issues
on
a
front
grill
as
it
warped
slightly
but
a
little
elbow
grease
got
it
in
place
just
fine.
I
recommend
them
for
any
part
they
carry
and
always
check
them
first
when
i
need
parts
for
projects.
Wouldnt
mind
a
bigger
selection
but
i
suspect
that
will
happen
in
due
time.
No
problems.
All
orders
fulfilled
without
a
hitch.
The
pump
works
flawlessly.
Stone
was
accurately
described,
in
inventory,
and
on
its
way
the
next
day.

Impressive
inventory.

I've
actually
done
business
with
them
before
several
years
ago,
and
would
again.
Book
byte
provided
me
with
a
low
costing
rental
and
they
shipped
out
my
book
very
fast
and
it
only
cost
$2
to
be
expedited.
I'm
so
glad
I
found
this
website.
Rapidly
becoming
my
go
to
site
for
pc

I
would
definitely
recommend
this
site
to
a

FULL

AND
EASY

I
experienced
an
all
round
shopping
experience
on-line.
After
browsing
GAK's
excellent,
comprehensive
and
competitively
priced
website
and
finding
what
I
thought
I
needed,
I
really
required
further
information
and
reassurance
before
my
final
purchase
decision.
As
I
was
busy
at
the
time
it
suited
me
to
communicate
via
email
rather
than
pick-up
the
telephone.
I
therefore

expected
a
delay
before
a
response
back,
but
low
and
behold
my
questions
and
queries
were
fully
answered
in
an
email
within
the
hour.
I
duly
completed
my
final
purchase
via
the
telephone
and
found
Richard
to
be
very
friendly,
polite,
knowledgeable
and
helpful,
I
was
truly
treated
as
a
real
customer

....
unfortunately,
something
that
is
not
always
experienced
in
retailing
these
days!
Within
the
specified
timeframe
(it
would
have
been
next
day
delivery
had
I
not
ordered
on
a
Friday)
my
items
which
were
well
packaged
were
delivered
safely
by
FedEx.
I
am
totally
delighted
with
the
equipment
chosen
and
cannot
fault
at
all
the
total
purchasing
experience.





THANK
YOU
GAK
Instrument

It

No

all
my
expectations.
Would
not
hesitate
to
use

on
further
purchases.
Very
satisfied
with
website,
price
and
delivery.
I
found
the
website
easy
to
use
and
quite
quickly
found
the

I
wanted.
Once
ordered,
I
was
given

I
was

Every

a
pleasure,
a
very

people
to
deal
with.
I

Im
very
happy
with
my

experience
there
I
needed
to
setup
a
second

for
my
new
company,
and
it
was
much
quicker
than
the
first
time
I
registered
my
company.

Instead
of
taking
a
week
it
took
4
hours.

Very
impressed.

I'm
almost
wishing
I
had
a
need
to
register
another
one!!
I
was
very
pleased
with
how
fast
I
received
the
part
I
ordered,
and
the

was
exactly
what
I
ordered.
No

Thanks
for
your

Always

The
attitude
of
your
service
staff
plus
the
quality
and
workmanship
of
your
team
has
kept
me
as
a
Town
Fair
Tire
customer
for
many
years
and
several
vehicles.
The
staff
delivered
on
time
and
as
promised.
They
were
courteous
and
professional.
I
have
complete
confidence
in
the
staff
at
this

location.
Excellent

Excellent

An
excellent
organization,
great
customer
service.
I
highly
recommend,
you
can
shop
with
confidence
Able
to
listen
and
understand
the
problem.
You
can
order
easily
but
try
to
return
the
old
product
for
the
core
charge;
it's
not
so
easy.
First,
you
need
to
get
an
RMA.
But
in
order
to
get
that,
you
need
to
fill
out
a
support
ticket.
But
wait,
you
can't
do
that
on
the
weekend,
you
have
to
wait
until
normal
business
hours
M
-
F
when
you
probably
don't
have
access
to
your
computer
because
you
are
at
work.
They
want
your
money
but
make
it
hard
to
return
anything.
It
was
really
easy
to
shop
and
order
here.

Even
the
delivery
was
quick
and
a
not
bad
price
for
shipping.
Quick
reliable
despatch
and
always
securely
packaged.
Easy
to

coolio
only
a

this

good

and
very
quick

the

The

As
many
aspiring
and
pro
guys
will
tell
you
once
the
camera
bug
addiction
hits
you
find
yourself
always
needing
more
equipment
but
on
a
budget
you
have
to
pick
and
choose
what
sites
and
what
return
policies
work
for
you
and
for
the
most
part
i
do
small
cheap
things
at
other
places
but
my
big
ticket
items
(canon
5d
mark
iii
etc)
I
use
B&H
because
the
last
thing
you
want
to
run
into
is
have
trouble
returning
an
item
due
to
a
cheap
websites
policy
with
B&H
I'm
very
secure
with
the
policy
plus
they
have
guys
they
will
guide
you
into
the
correct
purchase
not
pressure
sell
you
on
an
expensive
item.
Ordered
parts
for
my
chevy
colorado
they
had
them
in
stock
within
a
few
days
I
had
the
orderd

on
my

step
will
defiantly
be
using
this
site
again.
Extra
convenient,
you
can
see
the
work
being
done.
Ordered
a
part
thinking
it
was
from
New
Jersey,
shipping
to
CT.

Part
shipped
from
CA
took
over
a
week...
Order
was
nearly
half
price
of
any
other
vendor
and
was
delivered
within
the
same
week.
I
will
definitely
be
ordering
from
West
Coast
again
and
will
be
recommending
them
to
friends.
Place
your
trust
in
B&H,
you
won't
go
wrong!
Ordering
from
PCGameSupply.com
is
very
easy
and
hassle
free.

Would

have
purchased
a

from

both

and
always
found
their

and

to
be
excellent.

now

it
after

where
massive

Excellent
service
at
a
very
competitive
price
We
had
quite
a
complicated
booking
and
Sarah
was
very
helpful
and
obliging
Was
a
little
concerned
to
order
because
of
some
of
the
reviews
I
had
read
about
customer
service.

They
had
the
best
prices
and
free
shipping
and
no
taxes
so
I
gave
them
a
try.

My
parts
arrived
quickly
and
were
exactly
what
I
wanted.

Boxes
were
packed
exceptionally
well
and
parts
were
of
the
quality
that
I
expected.

I
would
definitely
order
from
Parts
Geek
again.

They
only
reason
I
gave
them
less
than
5
starts
is
because
they
don't
seem
to
answer
their
phones.

BUT...

I
did
fill
out
a
customer
request
form
and
I
was
responded
to
quickly
with
excellent
customer
service.

I
was
even
given
a
$10
discount
that
I
didn't
expect!

I
think
that
because
of
the
high
volume
of
parts
that
they
ship
they
are
bound
to
get
some
negative
reviews.

I
was
very
pleased
with
the
overall
experience.

must

One

"AWESOME"
I've
tried
to

a

with

I
can't,
they

I've

if
not
the
best.
Whenever

looking
for

I
always
check
out

I
have
found
the
service
online
and
at
the

to
be
great.
I

West

all
the
items
I
was
looking
for
at

My
items
arrived
on-time
and
as

on

I
would
also
note
that

Leon

out

to
make
your

perfect
and
flawless!
They
sent
me
the
wrong
part
,left
me
on
hold
and
kept
on
disconnecting
me
for
over
an
hour
,
until
I
gave
up.
And
never
tried
to
help
me,
even

after
I
emailed
them.
I
still
have
not
seen
any
attempt
to
help
me
out.
I
don't
know
what
else
they
could
do
wrong.
Normally
a
very
handy
way
to
pay
for
things
but
we
believe
that
we
have
had
an
account
compromised
in
the
past.
After
a
payment
was
made
to
a
person
in
Chile
(we
are
in
the
UK
and
have
no
connections
with
S
America)
it
was
difficult
to
get
the
payment
cancelled.
The
level
of
service
was
extremely
poor
and
had
left
my
partner
in
tears.
It
was
threatening
to
expose
the
details
to
the
press
that
resulted
in
the
payment
being
cancelled.
Rather
distressing.
We
do
not
use
Paypal
anymore.
I
would
like
to
see
Paypal
improve
their
service
levels
on
the
odd
occasion
when
things
go
wrong.
I

This
was
my

and
my

was
planned
on
a

Needless
to
say
I
was
in
a
bit
of
a
panic
seeing
as
how
it
normally
takes
over
a
month
to
get
a
passport
and
I
was
planning
the
trip
in
only
two
weeks..
It

is
a
great
for

More
people
are
doing

on

own
and
it
is
hard
to
find
parts
at
such
a
great
value.

I
also
had
no
problems
returning
parts
that
do
not
fit
or
are
just
the
wrong
part.
I
am
very
satisfied
by

I
bought
a
Oakley

the
order
was
done
fine,
the

within

provided
but
the
frame
on

had
two
scratches
one
of
them
being
right
in

of
the
frame
and
quite
deep/noticeable.
Im
a
bit
disappointing
with

because
i
noticed
the
plastic
box
where
the
glasses
came
didn't
have
any
sealed
plastic

on
it
so
i
presume
it
has

Just

was
as
described

My
first
choice
for

There
was
a
problem
with
the
lights
which
I
ordered.
It
was
the
fault
of
the
supplier
to
Castlegate
lights.
They
were
extremely
helpful
in
correcting
the
problem
to
my
satisfaction.
Ordered

SCAM
ALERT!!!
Be
VERY
CAREFUL
when
booking
through
this
website.

I
will
NEVER
use
them
again.

I
received
an
email
confirming
a
reservation
only
to
get
to
the
airport
to
find
out
the
reservation
was
cancelled.

I
ended
up
paying
full
fare.

I
called
FlightHub's
"customer
service"
department
only
to
be
told
that
they
sent
me
an
email
that
the
confirmation
was
cancelled
due
to
a
problem
with
the
credit
card.

My
credit
card
was
charged
but
the
charge
was
reversed
the
day
before
my
flight
without
me
knowing.

The
response
and
reason
for
my
problem
is
that
I
didn't
read
the
contract.

The
supervisor
put
the
blame
on
me
for
not
reading
thing
contract.
I
asked
him
who
reads
an
entire
contract
and
he
tells
me
that
he
does
and
everyone
should.

So,
be
VERY
CAREFUL
if
you
buy
a
ticket
from
this
site.

This

a

to

no

about

subsequent
to
booking
through
you,
I
did
get
a
cheaper
offer,
and
speedier
delivery
from
another
local
supplier,
which
rather
undermines
your
major
selling
point.
Easy
order,
good

and
good
product.
I
highly
recommend.
they
delived
the
exact
part
i
wanted

faster

they
said
After
ringing
around,
the

seemed
quite
reasonable.
Couldn't
believe
it
when
I
got
a
further
reduction
after
delivery
due
to
other
deliveries
in
my

Brilliant!
they

Nevertheless,

I

I

still
never

I
don't

Delighted!
It
started
when
Parts
geek
shipped
my
order
from
different
locations
and
charged
me
shipping
from
each
location.
In
addition
the
order
was
incomplete
and
rather
than
shipping
the
missing
items
they
gave
me
a
refund
for
them
(still
got
charged
for
the
shipping.
About
time
to
have
a
service
that
allows
you
to
bypass
the
thieving
banks
when
sending
money
abroad.
Ordering
from
Parts
Geek
is
a
no

They
beat
all
of
the
local
parts

prices
and
even
with
shipping
and
"optional"
insurance
the
price
was
still
less.
Shipping
was
fast
and
the
part
was
an
exact
match
so
it
was
no
problem
installing
it.

for
someone
who
usually
buys
his
ales
in
the
local
shops
it
was
most
refreshing
to
go
to
a
website
and
find
long
forgotten
ales,
the
temptation
was
to
keep
adding
to
the
basket
and
let
the
bill
rise
to
crazy
amounts
but
I
stopped
at
24
amazing
bottles
of

I
was
more
amazed
to

in

48
hours
the

were
in

ready
for

to

i
went

none

so
i
went

I
have
traveled
now
in
southeast
Asia
for
three
years
a
friend
told
me
about
agoda
and
it
has
been
the
only
way
I
book
my
hotels.
I
have
tried
to
talk
to
hotel
management
and
they
won't
even
give
me
the
rate
I
get
with
agoda.
I
can
say
in
the
three
years
now
that
I
have
used
their
site
I
have
never
encountered
a
problem
of
any
sort.
I
am
in
Thailand
again
and
booking
all
my
hotels
with
agoda.
I
have
booked
my
hotels
with
as
little
as
three
hours
notice
and
still
everything
was
never
an

Highly
recommend
the
site.
EXCELLENT

that

can
be
a

The

was
exceptionally
good
so
i
thank

As
for

So

the

The

Its

Using
hostelworld
is
just
like
using
most
other
travel
websites,
though
this
one
geared
towards
hostels.

One
feature
I
especially
liked
was
the
MAP
feature
which
showed
all
the
different
hostels,
and
their
distance
to
each
other
and
the
various
sites
of
a
city.

One
thing
I
found
out
is
that
HostelBookers.com
does
not
charge
a
booking
fee,
something
that
may
give
me
pause
to
use
hostelworld
again.
I
have
ordered
a
number
of
times
and
have
always
been
very
pleased
with
the
response.

They
have
everything
I
need
and

very
quickly.

I've
used

quite
a
few
times
now
when
I've
lost
my
lenses
or
left
them
behind
somewhere.
The
site
is
easy
to

the

is
hugely
reliable.
The
angels

I
purchased
are
of
good

and
quite
reasonably

was
also
good,but
the
personal

made
it
that
little
bit
special.

Wouldnt
hesitate
in
dealing

or
recommending
.
Fantastic
range
of
high
quality
products,
communication
throughout
the
ordering

is
clear
keeping
you
up

regarding
your

and
as
expected

Highly

Will
continue

and
again.
Good

After
using
multiple
sites
to
oder
parts
ive
always
relied
on
this
site.
The
parts
ordered
and
received
were
correct
unlike
some
other
sites.
The
shipping
was
faster
than
thought,
within
a
few
days
the
parts
were
shipped
and
received.
My
friends
and
myself
will
continue
to
use
this
site
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
normal
or
even
rare
parts.
I
was
hoping
I
could
find
an
original
wheel
rim
online
to
replace
a
bent
one
on
my
93
Honda
Civic.
I've
spent
too
many
hours
at
salvage
yards
with
unsatisfactory
results.
I
am
completely
satisfied
with
what
I
got.
They
sent
a
tracking
number
and
then
the
wheel
arrived
in
perfect
condition.
Thanks.
Keep
up
the
good
work.
I
ordered
the
razor
and
was
amazed
by
how
quickly
I
received
it.
I
had
made
a
mistake
in
ordering
and
the
customer
service
department
was
very
quick
to
correct
it
for
me.
What
was
ordered
came
quickly
and
in
the
high
quality
I
have
come
to
expect
from
this
company.

Thank
you!
Very
glad
that
among
the
various
ads
I
selected
them.

From
the
outset,
the
data
collection
made
sense,
and
the
turnaround
on
submissions
bear
estimates
and
expectations.

The
company
personnel
demonstrated
professionalism
as
well
as
an
ability
to
find
solutions
and
options
that
worked
for
us.

Very
happy
with
the
process
and

I
recommend

When
I
needed
something
for
my
shower
I
found
it
easily
and
after
I
ordered
it
I
was
kept
informed
as
to
it's
delivery.
In
short
it
was
easy
and
efficient.
Impressive
service
throughout
the

and

Really
easy

I've

My
AC
in
my
car
broke
so
I
needed
to
get
a
replacement
blower
motor
resistor.
I
looked
online
and
found
the
part
at
a
very
good
price
at
PartsGeek.com.

It
was
so
good
that
I
even
paid
extra
money
to
get
2-3
express
delivery.

Well
I
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for.

Not
only
did
I
waste
my
money
paying
for
rush
delivery,
because
the
package
took
6
days
to
arrive,
but
I
also
received
the
completely
incorrect
part.

Mistakes
happen,
I
guess.

I
contacted
the
service
department
to
fix
the
problem.

An
automated
email
informed
me
that
a
customer
service
representative
would
be
contacting
me
within
24-48
hours.

Two
days
later
I
received
an
email
saying
that
the
warehouse
was
contacted
and
my
case
was
being
investigated.

That
was
almost
two
weeks
ago.

This
company
seems
to
be
irresponsible
about
accurate
business,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
care
about
the
customer.

I
would
not
recommend
PartsGeek
to
anyone
in
the
future,
and
I
am
considering
going
on
Facebook
and
spreading
my
story.
We
rented
a
passenger
van
for
a
trip
in
France.
The
price
was
the
same
as
renting
direct
with
Avis,
and
when
I
called
couple
of
times
with
questions,
they
answered
the
phone
right
away.

We
needed
to
arrange
paperwork
to
bring
the
vehicle
on
a
ferry
and
they
took
care
of
it
promptly.
Happy
customer!

is
fair
and
you
get
what
u

The
reason
i
didn't

But
despite
that

I

and
online
site.
Great
seller,
My
Scan

Tool
was
very
well
packed,
lighting
fast
shipping.
I
wish
all
sellers
were
like
them
!
Fast
as
a
shark,
p&p
free
I
think
my
parts
got
here
before
I
finished
ordering.
Everything
was
a
perfect
fit
and
the
pricing
was
in
line.
Best
on-line
parts
store.
This
website
was
fantastic
because
it
had
every
product
I
needed
at
a
lower
price
than
any
other
site
I
have
found.
A
very
straightforward
process.
Web-page
was
easy
to
navigate
with
all
parking
options
clearly
highlighted.
I
do
really
like
Shopto
as
a
company.
They
deliver
extremely
fast
and
always
have
amazing
prices.
However,
the
website
could
do
better,
here
are
my
suggestions:-
My
experience
of
Blackcircles.com
has
been
flawless.
I
needed
some
winter
tyres
for
my
van,
and
went
driving
about
to
the
usual
big
garages
and
came
away
feeling
like
I
was
being
sold
some
budget
tyres,
so
I
hit
the
internet
and
Blackcircles.com
gave
me
a
price
on
some
branded
tyres
which
was
very
appealing,
so
I
bought
them
and
chose
my
local
independent
garage.
The
Pit
Stop!
Garage
in
Mirfield
was
just
fantastic
-
a
warm
welcome
from
Andy,
who
was
a
true
tyre
fanatic
and
if
you
want
to
talk
tyres
and
wheel
alignment,
then
this
guy
knows
it
all.
I
felt
really
secure
that
these
guys
(Andy
and
Luke)
would
do
a
great
job,
and
they
didn't
let
me
down.
They
were
efficient,
friendly,
passionate
and
incredibly
knowledgeable.
I
cannot
speak
highly
enough
of
them.
I'll
be
going
back
and
recommending
them
to
anyone
I
know.
Finally,
great
and
affordable
shows.
Enough
choices
in
entertainment
to
satisfy
every
taste.
Every
show
I
have
seen
with
Goldstar
tickets
has
been
great,
and
the
venues,
very
comfortable
with
good
acoustics.
The
seats
have
always
been
good,
with
good
visibility.
I
highly
recommend
Goldstar
for
anyone
who
loves
theater.
I
stated
that
i
needed
the
drivers
side...only
to
recieve
the
wrong
side...and
they
couldnt
even
offer
to
send
me
the
right
part
while
i
was
shipping
the
wrong
one
back...
Best
support
and
pearls
in
the
industry.
Needed
a
gift
to
arrive
in
time
for
our
anniversary.
I
spoke
to
support
ensuring
me
that
they
would
be
able
to
ship
it
out
the
same
day
it
was
ordered
and
they
were
right.
Not
too
long
ago
whenever
I
purchased
electronics
I
would
opt
out
of
any
form
of
protection
or
insurance.
I
thought
that
this
was
a
waste
of
money,
that
the
warranty
or
guarantee
from
the
manufacture
or
company
was
enough
and
anything
additional
was
a
waste
of
money.
Then
I
discovered
Square
Trade.
True
coverage
at
affordable
prices.
My
first
policy
was
a
Samsung
TV.
It
is
so
comforting
knowing
that
this
very
valuable
part
of
our
family
is
protected.
We
receive
most
of
our
entertainment
and
information

from
this
Smart
Television.
It
is
more
then
a
Television
and
with
this
coverage
it
brings
us
Peace
of
Mind.

Since
this
purchase
I
have
protected
many
other
electronics
from
Printers,
To
Cameras
and
plan
on
adding
even
more.
Peace
of
Mind
Protection.
The
car
is
OK,
service
is
acceptable.
I
originally
attempted
to
purchase
the
order
from
a
camera
company
from
NY
and
they
lost
the
package,
then
a
friend
recommended
ordering
directly
from
you
and
i
will
from
now
on.
I
recommend
this
site
and
will
continue
to
use
this
site
for
any
of
my
auto
parts
needs.
I
was
very
pleased
to
find
someone
who
would
provide
cartridges
of
single
colours
for
my
Brother
printer.

I
had
recently
replaced
2
yellow
cartridges
which
must
have
been
faulty
as
they
had
leaked
empty

as
soon
as
fitted.

Printer
is
now
working
fine.
Dropping
off
the
car
at
T5
was
easy
&
the
guy
was
waiting
to
collect
the
car;
however
after
collecting
our
luggage
I
placed
the
call
as
requested
&
no
one
answered.
I
called
again
in
the
terminal
&
number
was
engaged,
then
tried
a
3rd
time
&
number
just
rang
&
rang.

Finally
got
through
when
we
arrived
at
the
car
park
&
was
told
my
car
would
be
15
minutes,
which
turned
out
to
be
30
minutes
-
not
good
for
a
stress
free
pick-up
standing
in
a
freezing
cold
car
park.
I
could
have
parked
for
half
the
cost
in
a
remote
car
park
&
caught
the
bus
in
the
same
time!!
Pricing
is
good
and
checkout
is
fast
and
easy
process.

I
buy
here
because
they
are
an
approved
vendor
for
the
hospital.
2nd
time
I
rented
from
Auto
Europe.

Was
dissatisfied
last
time,
but
lured
back
in
with
a
very
low
rental
rate.

This
time
rented
a
Fiat
Panda
"or
similar"
and
was
given
Fiat
500...both
very
small
car,
but
the
500
was
impossible
to
fit
3
people
and
3
bags.

Paid
extra
to
upgrade
to
Fiat
Punto...
no
big
deal.

The
500
is
ridiculously
small,
though,
and
should
not
be
considered
in
the
same
class
as
the
Panda.
I
thought
this
might
be
some
scam
that
took
ages
/
tried
to
bump
you
on
the
value
once
they
received
it,
but
no,
I
couldn't
have
been
more
wrong.
I
tryed
[external
reference]
and
was
not
impressed
but
Gift
Cards.com
was
quick
easy
and
the
cards
arrived
in
a
timely
manner.

and

other

When
you
ordered
over
a
thousand
pounds
delivery
was
free.
But
i
ordered
over
a
thousand
pounds
but
was
charged
50

because
i
wanted
it
sooner
how

bad
is
that.would
not

them
again
unless
i
was

charge.
I

You

They

They
complete

give
you
an

#,
and
then
turn
around
and
tell
you
they
cancel
it
due
to
"incorrect
payment
information".
I
verified
my
info
with
my
bank
THREE
times
to
which
all
my
info
was
CORRECT.

My
father
also
go
rejected
for
incorrect
info
when
his
info
was
also
correct.

On
top
of
that,
they
still
take
your
funds
on
this
so
called
"cancelled"
order
and
have
your
bank
hold
the
money
for
5-7
business
days!

Seriously??
You
complete
my
order,
cancel
it,
and
still
put
a
hold
on
my
money??
Your
customer
service
was
no
help
"there
isn't
anything
we
can
do".
My
bank
was
more
helpful
that
you
all
and
I
won't
be
using
this
site
again.
I
have
stopped
others
from
using
you
and
your

are
fake.

Good
riddens!!

They
said
that

We

The

we
showed
up
during
the
opening
hours
,
12:15
when
it
is
supposed
to
close
at
13:00.
We
waited
for

20
Mn,
no
one
came.
We
called
the

number
provided
on
the
reservation
slip.
No
one
picked
up
the

Unacceptable.
I'm
glad
we
didn't
show
up
with
a

but
only
with
a

Online
ordering
with
Boiler
Juice
is
so
simple
and
straightforward
you
can
see
all
the
pricing
before
you
buy.
What's
more
they
email
you
when
they
are
delivering
in
your
area
so
you
can
save
by
buying
as
part
of
a
group,
you
usually
find
the
price
is
cheaper
than
your
quote
by
buying
this
way.
All
in
all
I
would
highly
recommend
Boiler
Juice
to
anyone,
great
service,
great
prices,
easy
ordering
what
more
can
you

You
will
need

soon
(it
will

They
did
everything
possible
to

me

As
I

Duke

was
extremely
helpful.
He
made
his
demeanor
so
it's
on
a
personal
level
to
where
you
fill
that
you
can
say
to
yourself
WOW
this
company
is
great.
That
is
what
makes
you
want
to
order
from
amiwear.com
even
more!
He
stated
that
they
have
a
great
exchange
policy
as
well
&
is
personally
helpful
in
size
selection
upon
reading
the
descriptions
of
the

He
will
stay
an
hour
on
the
phone
with
you
just
so
you
can
be
one
happy
customer
&
have
any
issue
almost
resolved.

THESE
REFILLS
WOULD
NOT
FIT
MY
HP
OFFICE
JET
4620

In
the
wake
of
online
shopping
all
over
the
world,
businesses
have
taken
their
business
online
and
are
looking
for
all
possible
strategies
and
techniques
of
marketing.
One
of
the
well
established
strategies
of
marketing
your
business
and
its
products
and
services
is
by
devising
the
strategies
on
how
to
get
more
twitter
followers
because
that
is
a
show
of
superiority
of
your
business
and
it
offers
you
an
opportunity
to
communicate
with
a
large
number
of
the
target
audience
easily.

That
amount
of
influence
you
have
over
the
internet
is
directly
proportional
and
related
to
how
many
twitter
followers
you
have.
Bigger
influence
means
more
clients,
more
sales
and
increased
profits
in
the
ultimate
which
is
the
target
of
every
business.
You
have
maintained
a
high
level
of
quality
each
time
I've
ordered
your
product.

I
also
love
your
packaging.

Neat
touch!!!
I
have
to
say
that
my
project
Kawasaki
would
never
have
been
finished
without
access
to
all
the
parts
I
needed
(And
I
needed
around
£2000
worth

had

with
it.
I
had
been
warned
not
to
trust

like

and
had
been
expecting
a

which
is
why
I
used

Great
service,
the
parts
were
just
as
they
said
they
would
be,
very
happy
customer.
Order
was
cancelled
without
explanation
after
receiving
confirmation
that
it
was
placed.
The
notification
was
ambiguous...only
said
that
my
credit
card
was
credited.
I
hope
it
was
actually
cancelled
because
I
ordered
the
parts
elsewhere
and
received
them
in
3
days!
I
was
unable
to
call
them
during
their
limited
hours
of
operation
due
to
my
work
obligations.
I
needed
timing
belts
for
a
Mitsibushi
of
all
things.

I
easily
found
the
parts
on
their
site.

My
ONLY
suggestion
for
better
service
on
their
part
would
be
if
they
could
rocommend
other
parts
that
normally
need
changed
at
the
same
time.

It
would
have
made
my
repair
job
more
efficient.

Must
admit
though,
I
feel
equally
responsible
for
not
ordering
enough
parts
the
first
time,
so
would
give
at
least
4
1/2
stars.

Not
many
sites
make
it
this
easy
to
find
the
correct
part.

the

fit

The
only

problem
is
that

Now
what,

more

the

bedroom
I
had
already
booked
and
contacted

to
let
them
know
the

and
they
were
not
flexible
at
all...Long
story
short
the
additional
for
the
upgrade
was
$300
through
book
it
and
I
was
already
paying
more
for
the
1
bedroom
than
the
price
going
direct
would
have
cost
for
the
2
bedroom...With
that
in
mind
I
attempted
to
get
the
$300
extra
reduced
slightly
but
the
Bookit

operator
had
no
authority
to
do
so....She
was
very
nice

she

just
had

go
with
whatever

fitter
so
left
it
with
him.
After
the

was

we
found
out

hard
lost

Sent
an

to
ask
what
we
had
to
do
to
get
it

and
was
sent
an

back
with
full

Would
use
again
and
would
highly

Took
me
an

fell
down

There
is
no

Had
to
go
to

was
almost
instant.
The

emits
to
say
that

andato

bene
con
il
mio
acquisto,
c'è
stato
solo
un
ritardo
nella

che
è
stato
poi
comunque
giustificato.
Al
prossimo
acquisto
sono
sicuro
che
non
si
ripeterà

comunque
si
rispettasse

This
was
by
far
the
best
car
purchasing
experience
I've
had.
The
entire
Drive
Time
team
at
the
Sattellite
Blvd
location
was
great.

My
salesman
Scott
Jackson
did
everything
he
could
to
make
sure
I
was
well
and
informed
and
happy
with
my
purchase.

The
cars
were
clean
and
there
was
a
good
variety
of
cars
on
the
lot.

Even
the
other
sales
persons
and
staff
were
friendly
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
they
could

in

some

Bought

Excellent

Great

Super

All
the

I
have
purchased
from

has
done
the
job
and
done
it
well.

The

have
superb

knowledge
and
are
always
helpful.
I
love
the
way
this

works.
There
are
a

kinks
that
it

to
work
out
along

This

Thank
you

This
website
is
just
ok.
It
doesnt
always
give
you
the
best
prices
availabe,
but
its
not
the
worst
either.
Clearly
this
is
the
best

on

Nothing
else
is
needed
to
be
said.
This
is
by
far
the
best
service
that
I
have
ever
had
buying
supplements
online.
The
shipping
was
fast
and
my
product
came
back
on
time.
I
am
defiantly
gonna
be
doing
the
rest
of

on
here
from
now

I
will
be
suggesting
this

to
all
of

are

Phoned
SFP
approx
20
minutes
prior
to
my
arrival,
but
they
couldn't
find
booking
as
only
made
on-line
that
the
same
afternoon.
Quickly
took
my
details
however
and
arranged
for
a
rep
to
meet
me
at
designated
place.
Waited
around
5
mins
before
chap
realised
I
was
already
parked
up,
but
swift
exchange
after
that.
RLE
does
a
great
job.
I've
sent
them
two
different
pairs
of
frames,
one
of
which
was
a
vintage
pair
from
a
thrift
store,
and
they've
created
lenses
that
fit
and
function
perfectly.
The
quality
of
the
lenses
has
been
exceptional
and
they've
got
great
customer
service.
Bonjour,
I've
bought
multiple
products
from
Heinnie
Haynes
and
have
always
been
satisfied
with
their
service.
I
live
in
Sweden
so
I
always
expect
things
that
I
order
from
the
U.K
to
take
at
least
a
week
or
two,
Heinnie
Haynes
has
always
exceeded
my
expectations
when
it
comes
to
delivery
time
and
with
emails
updating
me
with
the
order
status.
The
products
I've
bought
from
them
have
always
been
of
the
highest
quality
and
I've
never
felt
the
need
to
exchange
or
return
anything
because
of
bad
quality.
I
would,
and
have,
recommend
this
company
to
anybody.
It
took
over
2
hours
and

modify.
While
I
was
on
hold
for
excess
of
35
minutes
and
no
one
answered
I
was
continually
told
that
I
could
modify
on
line.
Then
a
recording
came
through
telling
me
that
I
would
be
charged
$25
for
modifying
my
reservation.

are
high

could
have
been
said.
I've
been
ordering
from
them
for
years
and
never
had
a
problem.
Very
impressive
speed.
Only
one
code
didn't
work
and
that
was
quickly
resolved

I

I

a

I
will
definitely
shop
with
them
again!
The

The

and
the
order
was
correct,

I
would
have
liked
an
email

and
tracking
number.
I'm
not
sure
why
I
didn't
get
one.
Otherwise

and
easy

saved

after

Make

I
was
please
with
how
quickly
my
order
was
processed
and
handled.

I
used
another
website
last
semester
to
order
textbooks
and
was
sent
a
novel
instead.

Definitely
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
Bookbyte

the
price
is
reasonable.
good
service,
fast
and

I
have
purchased
readers
from
this
company
on
three
other
occasions
and
I
shall
continue
to
use
and
recommend
this
company
in
the
future.
It's
hard
to
knock
a
company
that
will
beat
any
competitor
by
5%.
I
love
supplement
warehouse
and
have
used
their
website
for
a
year.
I
love
them.
Plus,
the
shipping
has
gotten
extremely
better
as
my
products
have
arrived
a
lot
faster
than
they
did
in
the
past.
This
is
a
must
review
site.
I'd
advise
anyone
who
shops
for
supplements
to
check
out
these
guys.
Apple
had
a
1
G
for
$10
less.
It's
the
same
brand
so
much
better
value
and
the
photos
were
very
informative.
The
apple
store
didn't
show
anything
worthwhile.
Also
this
has
all
cables
included
for
any
situation.
Had
a
slight
problem
with
a
discount
code
not
applying
correctly
and
being
overcharged
on
an
order.
Filled
in
a
support
request,
had
a
response
with
half
an
hour,
a
resolution
a
few
minutes
later
and
a
refund
appear
on
my
card
the
next
day.
First
rate
response.
Maybe
they
have
a
great
product,
I've
no
idea.
I
placed
a
small
order
seven
days
ago
now,
before
2pm,
everything
showing
as
in
stock
(and
still
is,
apparently),
the
money
left
my
credit
card
then
and
it
still
hasn't
been
dispatched
(or
in
any
way
changed
in
status
since
I
first
placed
the
order),
just
says
"Order
in
Process".
This
is
my
first
time
using
MyProtein
but
if
"same
day
dispatch"
actually
means
"over
a
week
to
dispatch"
as
appears
to
be
the
case
then
it
will
probably
be
my
last.
Ordered
one
day
with
standard
delivery
and
delivered
the
next..
Fantastic!!

I
made
a
reservation
thinking
I
was
calling
the
Sheraton.

I
specifically
asked
about
their
cancellation
policy.

I
was
told
they
do
not
charge
a
cancellation
fee
but
if
the
hotel
charges
a
cancellation
fee
they
would
"pass
it
on".



I
booked
a
date
that
was
6
months
away
and
cancelled
28
minutes
later.

My
card
was
charged
$318
as
a
cancellation
fee/penalty.

I
contacted
the
Sheraton
hotel
.

They
told
me
they
would
not
charge
a
cancellation
fee
under
these
circumstances.

I
contacted
the
crooks
Hotelreservations.com
and
was
told
they
would
reverse
the
charges.

They
lied
again.

Nothing
was
reversed.

I
filed
a
dispute
claim
with
the
credit
card
company.

The
hotelreservations.com

lied
to
the
Credit
card
company,
telling
them
that
I
was
told
of
their
cancellation
policy.

So
these
people
are
crooks,
liars
and
ripoff
scam
artists.
It
was
fast,
its
only
take
less
than
an
hour
to

Good
job!
Priceline
is
the
one
site
you
can
count
on
to
get
a
deal
when
you
forgot
to
book
or
didn't
know
exactly
where
you
would
end
up
for
the
night.

As
a
business
traveler
who
plans
road
trips
consisting
of
week
long
jaunts,
often
I
find
myself
driving
until
my
eyes
can
no
longer
focus
on
the
road.

While
most
travel
sites
will
not
allow
you
to
make
last
second
reservations,
Priceline
often
will
not
only
take
the
reservation,
but
give
me
a
great
price
on
top
of
it.

I
had
a
problem
with
my
on
line
paymement
service
(french
banks
are
some
sort
of
North
Korean
administrations,
and
they
don't
want
you
to
spend
YOUR
money...)
I
had
to
call
the
service
to
find
a
way.
Barbara
was
absolutely
perfect,
professionnal,
patient
and
serviceable.
She
solved
my
problem
in
three
phone
calls
and
sent
me
my

immediatly.
B&H
carries
virtually
everything!

The

is
huge.

They
are
rarely
out

And
the
prices
are
unbeatable.

Shipping
is
quick,
but
I'm
in

is
not

within
5
minutes
of

them
-
never

a

with
an

and
nearly
always
find
that
they
are
cheaper
on
new

than
most

I
found
the

the

Great

This

the

company
out
there
for
tyres.
I've
used
them
twice
for
tyres
all
round
on
my
work
vehicle
and
car,
and
both
times
I've
bought
4
tyres
for
the
price
it
would
cost
me
for
3
elsewhere.
Simply
look
on
the
internet
for
the
best
rated
tyres
for
your
vehicle,
and
then
look
on
blackcircles

for
the
tyres.
They
then
send
the
tyres
to
a
local
garage
near
you
who'll
contact
you
with
a
time
to
fit
them
while
you
wait,
it's
so
easy.
I've
used
Tim

motor
engineers
in
Bridlington,
who
were
absolutely
brilliant.
Ordered
4
items
for
a
Toyota
Tacoma
pickup,
a
radiator
support,
grill
assembly,
headlight
assembly,
and
a
side
marker
light.

Although
each
item
was
wrapped
in
a
thin
wrapper
or
box,
it
was
all
thrown
into
one
very
large
oversized
box
for
the
items.

Everything
could
of
fit
into
a
box
a
quarter
the
size
or
smaller
and
even
the
delivery
driver
made
that
comment.

No
packing
material
between
the
items
which
is
why
the
I
can't
honestly
blame
the
carrier
for
the
the
damage
to
the
plastic
grill
that
was
sustained.

all
items
combined
weighed
maybe
20
pounds
at
the
most
and
I
was
charged
for
70
pounds.

Didn't
really
understand
that
but
dealt
with
it
as
two
of
the
items
probably
considered
oversized
but
nowhere
overweight.


Haven't
had
the
chance
yet
to
put
the
items
on
the
truck
but
so
far
other
than
the
grill
being
broken
and
cracked
in
3
different
everything
else
looks
to
be
in
good
shape
and
what
I
ordered.


Happy
with
the
easy
of
ordering
and
everything
that
I
needed
being
in
stock.

Will
probably
order
again,
just
one
piece
at
a
time.

Splendid
service
from
Anchor
Pumps
ruined
by
the
attitude
of
the

Brian
of

would
not

if
he
fell
over
one!!!

Both
the
transfers
from
and
to

took
at
least
twice
the
time
estimated
time
of
45
minutes.
Very
few
of

other
passengers
on
the
buses
had
journey
times
of
45
mins
and
I
suspect
those
who
did
had
been
quoted
much
shorter
times
to
and
from
resorts
nearer
to
the
airport.

The
departure
from
the
airport
was
on
time,
probably
because
the
bus
was
full
when
we
arrived.

Pick

30
minutes

I
think
this
company
communicates
well.

It
quickly
fairly
dealt
with
a

problem

I
had
with
a
purchase
(colour
not
as
ordered).

This
is
the
mark
of
a
good
company.
I
had
to
cancel
an
order
for
a
wash
machine
almost
immediately
after
it
was
placed.

Cancellation
policy
is
very
clearly
stated
in
terms
and
conditions
and
in
my
opinion
somewhat

unusually
it
fully
recognises
customers
rights
under
the
relevant
legislation.
Item
wasn't
delivered
and
a
full
refund
made,
all
without
hassle.
Got
a
fist
time
order
pack.
Included
two
Hereford
ribeye
steaks
.

The
pack
(it
was
an
introductory
offer)
was
very
good
value.
It
arrived
in
on
time,
was
well
packed;
and
very
fresh.

The
items
we
have
used
seem
to
be
good
quality.

We
bought
the
pack
primarily
to
try
the
steaks
and
I
have
to
say
they
very
good
and
away
above
average.

Will
consider


buying
the
steaks
again

but
will
need
to
spend
some
time
whether
they
are
significantly
less
expensive
than
what
can
be
got
from
supermarkets
or
our
local
butchers
as
Westin
Gourmet
claims..

However
I
have
no
doubt
bout
the
the
quality
and
providence
of
the
meat.

The
quick

is
important
as
we
are

for

and

sometimes

to
get
the

Having
previously
bought
another
elliptical,
which
I
returned,
less
than
three
months
after
I
bought
it,
I
shopped
around
for
a
replacement.
I
found
the
one
I
wanted
I
contacted
New
Level,
spoke
to
Jo,
who
was
more
than
helpful,
even
though
the
one
I
wanted
was
out
of

She
offered
me
the
next
level

with

deal
I
couldn't
refuse.

an

in

for
my
goods,
it
was

arrived

The
system
is
a
good
one
but
unfortunately
the
human
interface
bit
appears
stretched
due
to
lack
of

probably
struggling
to
cope.

I
had
many
missing

even

Gift
shopping
for
my
wife
can
be
challenging.
After
many
years
I
begin
to
get
the
drift
of
what
she
likes.
I
took
a
calculated
risk
and
tried
buying
something
risqué
that
had
good
reviews
for
fit.
She
was
so
impressed
she
made
it
clear
that
she
would
like
another
Freya
bra.

She
loves
the
fit
and
the
look.
When
a
gift
makes
her
look
good
and
feel
good,
I
am
well
pleased.

This
was
the
first
time
that
we
have
had
to
get
a
prescription
from
the
Vet.in
order
to
buy
dog
food.
The
Vet.
told
us
that
a
prescription
was
necessary
to
purchase
this
kind
of
food.
While
shopping
on
the
net
I
discovered
that
some
of
the
food
suppliers
required
a
written
prescription

for
the
same
food
while
some
did
not
,including
PetFlow.
Is
this
some
kind
of
a
medical
violation
or
what?
It
was
much
simpler
not
to
have
to
use
a
prescription
but
your
add.
on
the
net
should
say
that
a
prescription
was
NOT
needed.

Thanks
much
They

To

The

So
worth

Will

My
only
concern
was
that

low
something
was

I
was

MicroDream
truly
saved
me!
I
have
a
five
year
old
HP
IQ770
.
It
was
a
$1,800US
priced
computer
when
it
was
purchased.
When
I
tried
finding
a
replacement
cooling
fan
I
searched
high
and
low
and
could
not
find
a
replacement
as
the
manufacturer
of
the
fan
discontinued
production
of
it.
MicroDream
not
only
had
several
used
cooling
fans
with
warranties
but
they
also
carried
every
piece
I
could
possibly
ever
need
for
my
PC.
While
searching
their
site
I
also
noticed
the
sell
refurbished
systems
and
their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable.
I
would
not
think
twice
before
ordering
from
MicroDream
in
the
future!
I
have
shopped
here
for
35
years
and
never
had
a
problem.

They
really
are
the
best
for
photo
and
electronics.
Always
have
what
I
need
when
I
need
it.

I
ordered
this

box
as
we
have
some
neighbours
with
a
huge

some
rats.
I
shoot
a
few

I
am

The

Convenient

VERY
VERY

I
cannot
review
the
product
yet
as
I
have
not
had
a
chance
to
install
it,
but
that
in
it
self
is
part
of
my
problem.
I
ordered
my
Thermostatic
Shower
Valve
at
11am
on
a
Thursday
and
paid
the
extra
for
next
day
delivery,
knowing
I
would
not
get
another
chance
to
fit
the
shower
for
up
to
3
weeks.
My
current
shower
is
leaking

3
gallons
every
2
hours
&
I'm
not
at
the
property
all
the
time.
Unfortunately
the
parcel
never
arrived
until
the
following
Monday.
I
will
give
the
lady
I
spoke
to
at

her
dues,
she
was
very
apologetic
and
immediately
could
see
the
error
and
offered
a
refund
of
the
extra
carriage.
This
didn't
help
my
situation
at
all
but
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the

provided.
I
would
use

I
found
their

very
easy

found
my

easily.
I
think
the
longest
I've
waited
for
them
to
arrive
is
about
5
days,
and
that
was
only
due
to
them
being
out

Not

at

I

put

yet,
but
I'm
sure
with
the

I've
gotten
so
far
they
will
all
be

I
would
never

he

with

that
were
less
than

came
along
and
at

I
was
not

I
started
with

the

and
before

I
found
that

out
there
among
all
the
others.
After
I
set
my

nothing

I
ordered
a
front
wheel

online,
it

24hours

it

well
with

I
would
recommend
this

I
ordered
some
parts
for
a

mostly
because
I
found

lowest

I
had
a

and
it

one

I'll
definitely
use

Almost
everything
arrived,
however
there
was
one
disappointment.
I
had

I
wanted
no

So
what
happened
I
received
an
alternative,
and
a
totally
unacceptable
one
at
that.

just
to
have
something
different,
what
did
I
receive
was
a
pack
of
PLAIN
WHITE
TOILET
ROLLS,
I
could
have
purchased
anywhere
here
in
the
US
at
a
lot
less
cost.
The
reason
I
wanted
them,
we
can
only
get
plain
white
here
in
the
US,
so
wanted
a
little
different,
if
they
had
sent
me,
blue,
green,
peach,
pink
ANYTHING
but
white
I
would
not
have
minded.
Besides
that
everything
else
arrived
OK
and
in
good
shape.
I
was
very
satisfied
with
the
part
ordered.
The
email
received
indicated
that
the
part
was
shipped
with
Fedex,
the
tracking
number
which
could
not
be
found
on
Fedex.
An
email
was
sent
back
to
PartsGeeks
and
was
informed
the
Fedex
tracking
number
was
valid
and
shipping
was
just
running
behind
orders.
Checking
with
Fedex
the
tracking
number
could
not
be
found.
The
part
was
sent
using
US
mail
(USPS)
NOT
Fedex
We
are
completely
satisfied
with
this
program
and
can
not
think
of
a
thing
that
they
could
improve.

i
highley
recomend
ordering
straight
from

rather
then
ebay
as
you
know
what
you
are
getting
is
the
real
quality
product
and
no
fakes
Be
aware
that
they
charge
a
whooping
£1250
as
a
minimum
deposit
for
the
cheapest
car
they
have
and
the
deposit
goes
higher
as
the
car
category
goes.

Your
fees
are
too
high.
Their
products
such
as
the
kettlebell,
steel
clubs,
and
steel
mace
are
of
high
quality
though
they
need
to
keep
up
with
supply
and
demand.
Their
kettlebells
are
not
from
the
ordinary,
the
zombie
and
monkey
molded
kettlebell
going
from
1/2
pood
to
2
pood
is
a
great
product
to
add
to

collection.

to

the
testimonials

shown
for

on
its

is

The

Hello,
Product
is
reasonably
priced.


Shipping
it
so
it
remains
cold
is
rediculously
priced,
and
I
could
not
do
it.


Fortunately,
it's
winter
in
the
north
east,
so
I'm
not
that
concerned.
A
very
swift
delivery
and
product
was
in
perfect
condition.
Same
service
was
free
with
Google
voice,
ashamed
they
are
discontinuing
support.

$60
a
year
is
OK,
however
this
is
at
the
upper
end
of
what
I
want
to
pay
for
a
home
phone.

I
pulled
the
trigger
due
to
the
free
calls
to
Canada
(I
don't
call
often
but
1
time
a
month
gives
the
service
value).

Service
has
been
very
good/dependable.

Customer
support
was
so
so
when
I
called
the
other
day.
The
representative
was
competent
and
helpful,
and
honored
the
lower
price
I
found
Gave
good
advice
on
the
choices
available
and
the
products
were
delivered
on

They
have
a
large
variety
of
great
products
at
the
lowest
prices!
This
website

an
excellent
job...had

Chatted
with

support
about
intermittent
dropouts,
noting
that
my

VOIP
(Time

that

He
steered
me
to
a

served
a

that
would
not

on
either
Internet

or

I
could
not
find
a
way
to
enable
it
to
run.
My
next
chat
attempt
with
support
was
taking
forever,
and
I
gave
up
after
30
minutes
and
was
still
sixth
in
line.
the
products
ordered
have
still
not
arrived.
The
above
says
it
all!
At
first
I
was
concern
that
the
website
might
rip
me
off
but
I
had
friends
who
always
buy
stuff
on
the
site
so
it
seem
trustworthy.
Booking
&
paying
on
line
was
really
easy.
I
was
a
bit
dubious
about
going
along
to
a
local
garage
for
the
first
time
as
normally
goes
to
main
dealer
but
the
custome
service
&
quality
of
work
was
excellent.
will
definitley
be
using
again
next
time!
Great

Got
a
very
nice
Movado
at
a
great
price.

Had
the
Jeweler
I
took
it
to
for
sizing
inspect
it
to
confirm
its
authenticity.

All
good,
no
issues
there.

Will
definitely
purchase
from
Martin
again.

I'll
just
mention
that
if
you
are
in
any
hurry
or
plan
to
buy
a
watch
as
a
gift,
please
plan
accordingly.

My
order
was
placed
on
3/2
and
I
finally
received
the
watch
on
3/15.

In
this
day
and
age
that
is
a
little
longer
than
I
would
have
preferred
to
wait.

But
then
again
you
can't
beat
the
price
:)
I
love
Boost
Speed,
but
I
hate
annual
subscriptions.
I
guess
it’s
cheaper
to
pay
for
a
product
like
this
annually
than
to
take
your
computer
in
for
service,
but
still.
I
would
prefer
to
pay
once
and
be
able
to
use
the
software
for
a
lifetime.
Even
then
I
still
prefer
to
use
Boost
Speed
over
any
other
program
as
it
has
never
messed
anything
up
on
my
computer
like
at
least
two
other
programs
did
a
while
ago.
It’s
a
great
product
overall.
A
conversation
in
the
pub
last
week,
"Hey
Mark,
i
have
this
great
new
track
i
just
made
in
my
studio,
its
an
MP3
file
on
my
phone
i'll
send
it
to
you
via

wait
you
have
an
iPhone.....................
excellent
products,
good
website,
always
willing
to
give
good
accurate
advice,
would
recommend
to
anyone.
This
is
my
second
purchase
from
ukjuicers.com,
First
a
juicer
(Domestic)
about
a
year
ago
which
gets
used
daily,
and
now
a
blender,
probably
the
best
purchases
I've
made
and
great
value.
The
website
is
informative,
easy
to
navigate
and
order,
free
quick
delivery,
couldn't
ask
for
more.
Would
recommend

to
ANYONE
They
made
extra
effort
to
ensure
we
received
the
piano
quickly.
It
arrived
as
promised.
I
could
not
be
any
more
impressed!
Heard
about
Select
Specs
from
GMTV
where
Martin
Lewis
was
reccomending
them
so
knew
it
was
a
genuine
site
otherwise
I
would
have
thought
it
was
too
good
to
be
true!
But
true
it
is!
I
absolutely
LOVE
my
new
glasses
and
at
£6
rather
than
the
usual
£125
it
costs
me
elsewhere
I
can
safely
say
that
I
will
never
shop
elsewhere
again!
Good
quality
frames,
quick
delivery,
unbeatable
price-
I
am
one
happy
customer!
Thankyou
SelectSpecs!

I've
been
trying
to
get
my
glasses
for
months,
was
charged
and
then
have
been
getting
biweekly
emails
telling
me
they
are
on
back
order.
I
had
to
cancel
the
order
after.
Extremely
dissapointed.
The
only
way
that
I
have
to
get
money
in
my
wallet
is
by
PSN
card
because
I
forgot
my
password
and
somehow
I
cant
get
a
new
one.
I
buy
PSn
Cards
and
put
the
money
in
my
wallet
since
my
PS3
sign
in
automatically.
I
bought
2
card
from
them
and
only
one
was
working.
I
bought
it
to
get
a
2200
FIFA
points
for
20
dollars
since
I
had
only
$
10
I
had
to
buy
1050
points
only
and
wait
for
the
other
10
in
the
next
day
and
loose
100
points.
now
they
are
asking
me
to
log
in
with
my
PSN
password
which
I
don't
have
to
check
in
some
other
web
site
if
my
Key
is
working
or
not,
and
I
already
sent
them
pictures.
Besides
loosing
my
100
points
I
still
have
to
w8
at
least
one
more
day
to
get
the
code
if
they
give
me
another
one.

and
janky.
I
hate
that
because
now
I
can't
shop
there
anymore.
I
used
to
get
all
my
plaid
there,
and
my
patterened
tweeds
and
all
my
wool
button
down
sweaters
too.
And
cool
fedoras,
knit
toboggans,
and
scarves
with
strange
prints.
Now
it's
nothing
but
a
hipster
hangout.
I
can't
stand
hipsters.
Amazon.com
has
grown
too
big
for
it's
breeches.
And
cookware,
exercise
machines,
power
sanders,
and
hiking
boots.
Did
I
mention
books?
Little
known
fact:
Amazon
sells
books.
All
kidding
aside,
I
love
Amazon.
I
buy
almost
everything
on
the
site.
When
it
comes
to
getting
the
best
price
at
the
best
condition
in
the
shortest
time,
Amazon
is
top
notch.
I
can't
say
enough
about
them
except
to
say
that
if
you
aren't
shopping
at
Amazon,
you're
paying
way
too
much
for
way
too
little
that
finally
shows
up
in
three
weeks.
I
recently
needed
to
replace
a
defunct
breaker
type
in
an
old
breaker
box.
Home
Depot
carried
the
part
in
stock.
Unfortunately,
I
had
to
RMA
*twice*
because
both
times
the
part
arrived
damaged
and
unusable.
Cheers
for
having
a
hard
to
find
part.
Boos
for
shipping
damaged
inventory.
In
the
end,
however,
I
did
get
my
breaker.
I
installed
it
and
it
works
well.
In
the
future
I
will
use
their
brick
and
mortar
stores
only,
to
ensure
I
get
a
working,
undamaged
part
before
I
leave
the
store.
Adam
&
Eve
is
a
great
retailer
for
finding
lots
of
specialty
adult
items.
No
matter
what
your
kink,
Adam
&
Eve
have
you
covered.
This
past
Valentine's
Day
I
gave
my
girlfriend
a
gift
certificate
to
Adam
&
Eve.
The
box
came
discreetly
marked,
and
when
she
opened
it
up
my
friends
became
worried...
they
didn't
hear
from
me
for
days.
Great
selection,
great
prices,
great
shipping,
great
job!
This
is
a
great
site
for
buying
computer
parts.
They
have
the
hard
to
find
parts
needed
for
replacements
in
older
computers.
An
example:
I
have
an
old
Pentium
4
system
from
2001
using
RDRAM,
a
dead
format.
I
use
it
for
a
Home
Theater
PC
nowadays.
Then
the
RAM
goes
kablooey!
Newegg
not
only
had
the
RAM
chip
for
this
defunct
technology,
but
had
it
in
stock!
Great
job,
Newegg!
This
is
the
best
site
for
finding
great
web
hosting.
I
saved
hours
of
time
by
using
Consumer-Rankings.com.
I've
been
in
the
market
for
a
web
host
for
a
couple
of
months.
I
kept
putting
it
off
because
there
are
so
many
options
out
there,
and
each
site
has
so
much
fine
print.
Consumer-Rankings.com
lays
out
all
your
webhosting
options
right
there
in
one
clean
page.
By
clicking
tabs
you
can
also
read
about
details
like
pricing,
bandwidth
limits,
storage
limits
and
what
kind
of
guarantees
come
with
the
service.
Condensing
all
this
information
into
one
place
using
an
easy
to
read
format
is
exactly
what
I
needed
to
make
an
informed
decision
and
choose
the
web
host
that
was
right
for
me.
Great
job,
Comsumer-Rankings!

We

when
I
made
resevations
I
was
Going

some
how
it
got
switch
to
San

I
called
them
right
back
with
in
the
hour
to
let
them
know
of
the
mistake
and
they
said
to
bad.
No
one
would
help.
Robert
employee
No.

would
not
help
in
any

No
customer
service
what
so
ever.
My
new

is
to
tell
all
how
they
SUCK!!!!!!
Always
a
great
place
to
shop
for
your
photographic
needs,
Good
service
and
the
best
prices
in
the

B&H
has
always
provided
the
best
possible

in
the
industry.
Beställde

I
would
definitely
rent
from
this
company
again
This
company
is
what
i've
been
looking
for.
they
have
what
you
need,
at
a
GREAT
price,
and
fast
shipping!
What
more
do
you
need?!?!
you
can't
fault
the
service,
this
was
the
third
time
we
have
used
appliances
online
and
for
our
next
need,
thay
will
be
the
first
port
of
call
I
will
use
this
site
again
and
recommend
to
friends.
So
much
better
in
all
ways
than
those
transfer
companies
I
ve
used
in
the
past.
Your

crap
don't
work
i
tried
to
find
the
phone
number
and
talk
to
a

no
answer
you
need
to
have
some
kind
of
person
communications
other
than

The
phone
quote
was
precise
and
non-pressure.

The
service
was
cordial,
positive
and
options
were
given.


Tires

the
only

was
an

not
really
necessary
in
my
opinion
but
I
agreed
to
it.

very

the

I
wanted
fast

Good
web
site
with
material
you
need
and
advice
you
can
trust,
I
have
personally
used
many
times.
I
broke
the
screen
on
my
Galaxy
S4
and
started
the
claim
process.
The
response
was
that
I
should
find
a
local
repair
place
to
fix
it
and
send
them
a
copy
of
the
invoice.
I
was
disappointed
at
first,
because
I
wanted
to
just
get
a
new
phone
the
next
day.
Later
I
realized
that
by
just
repairing
my
current
phone
I
would
not
have
to
go
through
the
hassle
of
moving
all
my
important
data
between
devices,
and
I
would
likely
have
lost
most
of
it
since
my
screen
was
completely
unusable.
A
local
repair
place,
gophermods,
fixed
my
phone
in
45
minutes,
it
looks
like
the
day
I
got
it!

I
scanned
and
emailed
my
receipt
to
square
trade
and
got
a
check
in
a
week,
no
bs
or
extra
questions
or
trying
to
get
out
of
paying
the
way
a
typical
insurance
company
would,
just
the
check.

Plus,
I
still
have
the
protection
plan
in
case
something
happens
again.


Glad
I
went
with
these
guys.
I
am
a
continued
returning
customer
because
of
the
professionalism
at
the
front
desk.
Mike
the
Manager
and
Mikey
sales
technician
are
the
reason
I
came
back.
Mike
gave
me
the
best
price
again
on
a
wheel
and
tire
package
and
I
check
other
retailer.
I
will
continue
to
return
to
the
Branford
store
because
of
these
two
men.
I
own
a
local
Barber
Shop
in
the
area
and
will
continue
to
send
my
customers
to
Town
Fair

I
spoke
very
well
of
your
services
!
Price

right

be

You're
prices
are
decent,
very
attractive
images
and
deep
depth
descriptions
that
caught
my
attention
and
ultimately
got
you
a
repeat
customer!
I
was
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
from
the
Gizzmo
Heaven
website.
It
was
the
best
price
I
could
find
for
a
USB
Wi-fi
stick,
so
I
was
a
bit
dubious
about
the
quality.
However,
it
arrived
within
two
days
by
Free
post,
and
I
had
it
up
and
running
within
a
few
minutes.
The
quality
is
first
class
and
the
signal
is
excellent.
I
will
definitely
use
this
site
again.
I
wish
I
could
put
into
words
my
excitement
for
the
discovery
of
Supplement
Warehouse,
because
I
am
absolutely
amazed,
jaw
dropped,
and
overwhelmed
as
I
sit
speechless
with
how
GREAT
they
truly
are!!!
The
1000
lumen
light
I
purchased
is
by
far
the
best
light
I
have
ever
used..
I
was
planning
to
use
this
light
as
my
backup
but
after
using
it
in
the
Bahamas
I
am
going
to
purchase
another
one
and
use
them
as
BACKUP
and
MAIN!!!

normally
I
wouldn't
care

much

after

I
cant

to
stop
looking.
The

extremely

and
the

are
always
on

Over

yesstyle

stars.
I
order
parts
well
over
a
week
ago
and
I
paid
for
fed
ex
shipping.
Now
all
of
a
sudden
they
decide
to
transfer
service
and
ship
through
the
post
office.
I
still
do
not
have
my
car
parts
and
I
would
never
order
from
them
again.
Customer
service
is
rude

puke
up

that
you

NEVER

On
January
3rd
2014,
The
first
coldest
day
of
the
year
my
wife
and
I
could
not
get
the
2006
to
start
and
after
about
45
minutes
with
AAA
we
finely
got
it
started
so
my
wife
dropped
me
off
at
work
,
took
the
car
to
the
38th
St.
lot
to
see
why
the
new
battery
had
ran
down
and
make
the
monthly
payment.
Well
she
found
out
that
the
problem
was
not
the
battery,
and
the
repair
would
cost
about
$600.00
plus
the
payment.
when
I
got
off
from
work
she
picked
me
up
in
a
car
that
the
dealer
loaned
her
while
they
worked
trading
the
2006
in.
So
it
took
a
day
and
a
trip
to
the
south
side
lot
where
we
were
to
pick
up
the
trade.
Here's
how
it
went:
They
could
not
find
the
car
on
any
of
the
lots
that
we
were
trading
up
to.
So
we
ended
up
driving
a
G6
off
the
showroom
floor
as
the
trade.
Need
less
to
say
that
by
trading
for
the
new
year
has
saved
us
some
money
making
our
new
year
a
little
brighter,
The
down
side
to
this
tell
is
that
it
took
all
day
sat
(1/4/14)
to
complete
the
transaction
because
of
the
mis-communication
between
the
lots
and
as
we
men
are
our
Saturdays
are
our
lazy
days
especially
in
the
winter.
Thanks
to
all
the
hard
work
the
dealerships
went
through
to
make
it
happen
my
wife
is
happy
NOW!!!
Thank
you
all

jump
rope
I

yesterday.

I

am
trying
the

reps
in
the

challenge.

Its
a
great
workout
but
the
rope
needs
swiveled
handles!

The
heavy
rope
is
hard
enough
without
trying
to
keep
readjusting
my
grip
to
keep
the
rope
from
tangling.
Can
you
help?

Thanks!

I
feel
this

was

the

I
have
now
taken
my
family
to
Paris
on
two
separate
occasions
and
employed
City
Segway
Tours
for
both
a
Sega
Tour
and
the
Skip-The-Line
Eiffel
Tower
tour.

These
folks
are
a
pleasure
to
work
with,
very
professional,
very
accommodating,
making
the
stressful
"organizational"
part
of
a
vacation
in
a

city
much
easier
to
deal
with.

2

had
along
with

slot.

I
called
City
Segway
Tours
to
tell
them
and
they
immediately
got
me
into
a
later
slot.

That
type
of
flexibility
and
help
was
very
refreshing.

I
will
use
these
folks
again

have
no

I
am
very
happy
with
my
recent
purchase
of
frames.
You
exceeded
my
expectation
with
how
easy
the
whole
process
could
be
accomplished.
Sizing
the
frames
gave
me
a
better
perspective
on
how
I
have
gone
wrong
in
the
past
--
I
took
what
other
vendors
offered
rather
than
sizing
the
frame
to
my
face.
You
made
it
all
very
easy!

Cool!
I
was
expecting
this
product
to
be
a
silicone
protective
sleeve
for
my
phone,
which
it
wasnt.

It
turned
out
to
be
no
more
than
a
sticker
for
my
phone.

Having
been
back
to
the
website,
this
fact
is
stated,
but
not
clearly
enough.

Especially
in
light
of
several
silicone
protective
covering
products
all
being
called
'skins/skinz'
from
other
manufacturers.

I
have
returned
this
product
as
it
was
not
what
I
was
expecting.
I
was
looking
for
a
multi-input
Audio
Interface
and
the
Presonus
FireStudio
seemed
like
the
perfect
answer.
I
bought
some
Greenhouse
Insulation
and
It
arrived
oh
so
quickly.
I
booked
a
Las

Package
on

After
booking
the

and
my

I
went
to
print
the

and
received
an
error
message
stating
only
the

portion
of
the

was
reserved,
not
the

The
error
message
told
me
to
call
the

representative
to
find
out
what
happened.

I
called
Book
It
and
waited
35
minutes
to
speak
with
a

being.

She
was
unable
to
help
me.

I
asked
to

with

and
was
placed
on

for
another
20
minutes
when
their

disconnected
the

I
have
ordered
several
items
from

in
the
past
and
have
never

with
them.
They

what
they
promise.
We
got

and
got
a

with
everything
we
needed
at

price.
What
have
I
gained
in
using
Interparcel
Onnit
has
always
been
prompt
and
seems
concerned
about
their
customers
and
reputation.

I
wish
they
would
offer
their
products
without
stevia...even
unsweetened
would
work
for
me.

As
it
is,
it
is
too
sweet
in
my
opinion.
The
jacket
arrived
very
quickly.

It
was
well
packed
and
protected.
The
quality
was
excellent.
In
fact,
it
was
so
good
that
I
telephoned
the
manufacturer
to
inform
them
that
I
was
delighted
with
the
jacket.

I
would
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
Country

anyone.
We
were
on
the
lookout
for
a

was
extremely

offer

have
a

team

to
backup
the

will
definitely

will

After
initially
being
sceptical,
having
never
purchased
from
this
company
before,
I
am
very
happy
with
the
product
and
service.

I
received
exactly
what
I
ordered
on
the
day
they
said
the
delivery
would
take
place.
The
part
80498
was
too
long
and
when
i
flexed
it
to
snap
the
upper
piece
into
place
it
bowed
the
plastic
where
the
lock
mechanism
is
at
and
it
popped
out.

I
will
package
these
back
up
and
return
them
for
a
refund.

because

so
I
gave

Thanks
again
I
will

you
again.

purchases
through
DRIS
have
been
nothing
short
of

In
both
cases,
I
got
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for,
and
I
got
it
at
a
price
that
beat
everybody
else.

Not
only
is
the
selection
better
than
you
can
find
almost
anywhere,
the
gear
is
quality!

Unfortunately,
I
now
find
myself
perusing
DiveRightInScuba.com
almost
daily
looking
for
something
else
I
"need."
Wanted
a
trustworthy

to

and
this

the
place.

alternative
to
playing

in

traditional

(scanning

it's
still
in

stages
so
didn't
want
to
spend
a
fortune
on
something
that
might
take
of.
That

aswell
as
being
good
value
these
are
good

and
they
arrived
within
24
hours
of

There's
only
2
possible
negatives
to

and
that
is
1)
the

this
cant
have
amounted
to

max
even
though
they
charged
£2.50
but
then
it
aarrived
quick
so
I
dont
mind
too
much.
Also
the
prices
on
the
website
don't
include
vat

after
its
in
the
basket
which
I
know
they
are
not
the
only
store
to
do
this
but
I
prefer
to
know
what
I'm
paying
when
I
put
it
in

not
just
at
the

There

this

If

they

they

so
that

Only
drawback
is
you

the

The

I
purchased

the

fit
very
pleased
about
that.
There
was
a
longer
wait
time
then
expected
on
the
delivery
because
I
paid
for
overnight

I
only
received
one
of
the

the
other
two
were

Helped

My

I
have
used

now
and
have
had
no
problems
on
either
occasion
There
are
an
overwhelming
amount
of
players
promotional
goods
and
custom

There
are
dozens
of
dozens
that
specialize
in
flash
drives
and
they
are
difficult
sort
through.

Working
with
Flashbay
was
incredibly
easy.

The
time
between
request
and
response
was
quicker
than
all
the
others.

Working
with
Ryan
was
easy.

Turnaround
time
for
proofs
was
fast.

The
product
came
a
day
earlier

Everyone
in

is
excited
about

I'll
be
happy
to
use

again.
I

If

I
found
what
I
was
looking
for
quickly
and
ordering
was
fast
and
easy.
The
price
was
very
reasonable
and
I
was
really
impressed
at
how
fast
the
part
was
shipped
and
delivered!
I
will
definately
use
them
again
if
I
should
need
a
part
and
highly
recommend
them
to
anyone.

For
the
third
time,
many
of
the
CDs
I
ordered
came
in
broken/cracked
containers.

The

are
fine.
I
literally

the

ordered,
paid
for
it
and

it

in
less

seconds.
The
customer

was

I
will

I
was

wear.

Well
Gripads
nailed
it.

Love
the
product
and
definitely
recommend
to
anyone.

Plus
my
wife
said
my

are
soft
again.
I
was
in
need
of
a
part
for
my
furnace
and
I
wasn't
sure
which
part
I
needed.
They
we're
able
to
find
the
correct
part
for
me
and
their
prices
were
much
better
than
anywhere
else
I
found.
They
were
friendly
and
ready
to
help.
Great
experience
I
would
recommend
them
to
anyone.
Thanks
I
have
been
able
to
find
parts
here
that
I
couldn't
find
from
other
suppliers.

I
was
disappointed
on
my
last
order
though.

I
ordered
5
small
parts
and
paid
the
extra
money
for
overnight
delivery.

They
shipped
two
of
the
parts
overnight
and
the
other
3
parts
they
shipped
"ground"
and
I
didn't
get
them
for
10
days!

When
I
complained
they
said
I
did
not
check
the
box
on
all
of
the
parts
indicating
that
I
wanted
them
shipped
overnight!

I
told
them
that
was
an
unsatisfactory
response
and
they
did
nothing
to
correct
the
situation.
My
wipers
were
delivered
in
two
days
in
a
strong
packaging.
Nothing
is
more
simple
than
to
order
online.
I
will
recommend
PartsGeek
to
all
my
friends.
I
was
having
trouble
choosing
a
replacement
case
for
my
favorite
Nikon
hiking
binoculars,
went
to
the
"live
chat"
feature
and
was
very
quickly
assisted
in
choosing
case.........
When
i
first
stumbled
across
the
website
i
was
abit
apprehensive,
but
after
my
first
purchase
i
wish
i
never
waited
so
long
before
finally
trying
to
give
the
site
a
go!
I
have
not
however
had
a
chance
to
experience
their
customer
service
when
something
has
went
wrong,
because
it
has
went
perfect
every
time.
I
cannot
fault
the
shopto
service
in
any
way,
it
was
incredibly
reliable
and
the
product
actually
arrived
earlier
than
expected.
I
will
defiantly
be
using
their
service
again.
I
also
love
the
feature
of
being
able
to
pre-pay
for
a
pre-order
aswell.
Very
easy
checkout
process
Always
nice,
on
time
and
great
prices
and
cant
beat
the
price
match!!
You
have
many
hostel
booking
websites
from
which
to
choose.
But
Hostelworld,
for
my
money,
is
the
best
of
the
bunch.
It
offers
more
and
better
hostels
and
accommodations
that
the
others,
whose
names
I
will
not
mention.
Hostelworld
never
has
let
me
down.
I
like,
also,
the
ability
to
write
my
own
reviews
of
hostels
on
the
site
and
to
access
a
personal
area
of
the
site
to
note

my
bookings.
Highly
recommended.
I
have
read
some
negative
reviews
about
parts
geek,
but
after
my
experience
with
them,
Its
a
fact,
you
just
can't
please
everyone.
Some
claimed
they
got
the
wrong
part,
others
claim
no
service
my
e-mail,
I
did
not
experience
these
problems,
not
only
did
I
get
the
right
part,
and
in
about
a
week,
but
I
had
a
concern
and
a
question,
and
Parts
Geek
folks
responded
to
my
e-mail
the
very
next
day.
For
those
of
u
who
claim
u
got
the
wrong
part,
it
just
might
be
that
u
don't
know
what
part
u
need!
These
folks
sent
u
what
u
ordered,
THANKS
PARTS
GEEK
for
giving
me
a
chance
to
speak
my
peace
and
for
getting
my
parts
to
me!
The
jury
is
still
out
on
your
product
as
I
haven'
had
it
long
enough
to
tell
about
the
quality
or
endurance.

Here
is
a
hint
about
your
surveys.

Just
ask
me
to
either
rate
your
service
with
a
check
mark
or
yes/no
types
of
answers.

Most
folks
don't
want
to
write
anything
down,
since
it
is
time
consuming.

I
will
give
you
a
good
mark
for
rapid
shipping
and
handling
and
also
pricing.
Todo

Peter

I
find
Westin

really
helpful.
Their
meats

are
first
rate
-
in
particular
I
like
their
veal
as
it's
really
difficult
to
find
in
the
shops
round
here.
They
deliver
promptly,
the
produce
is
nicely
packed
and
is
ready
for
either
consumption
fresh,
or
to
go
in
the
freezer.
We
had

journey
from

The
price
are
a
little

high

and

is
to
slow

The

Thank

They
have
what
I
was
looking
for
and
was
cheaper
then
any
of
the
other
companys
I
was
looking
at......
I
ordered
a
short
run
of
USB

cards
and
was
extremely
pleased
with
both
the

and
the
final
product.
I
had
a

to
meet
and
they

Based
on
that,
I
would
happily
recommend
them
and
will
use
them

in
the
future.
I
don't
normally
do
reviews
on
websites,
but
i
must
say
that
i
feel
it
is
necessary
this
time.
acitydiscount.com
has
every
equipment
need
that
i
am
looking
for,
and
it
is
very
informative
to
specifications
for

I
did
have
to
call
for
a
question
i
had,
and
an
actual
person
answered
the
phone,
without
having
to
hold,
and
they
were
able
to
answer
my
question!
Thanks
guys!!!!
Easy
to
find
which
product
I
was
looking
for,
straightforward
to

and
quick

Once
again
I
am
very
pleased
with
my
order
from
1st
Art
Gallery.
This
time
I
ordered
3
paintings
and
they
were
all
excellent.
They
also
expedited
my
order
enabling
me
to
give
2
of
the
paintings
as
gifts.
My
house
is
beginning
to
look
like
a
museum
and
I
am
thrilled.
1st

I

I
bought
a
piece
of
Glencoe
so
that
I
could
do
my
bit
to
help
preserve
part
of
Scotlands
history,
the
fact
that
for
doing
so
I
have
earned
the
right
to
use
the
title
of
lord
this
makes
buying
a
bit
of
Scotland
a
great
way
to
stay
patriotic
and
I
look
forward
to
buying
more
for
my
family
at
a
later
stage
It
dawned
on
me
recently
that
my
small
business
needed
a
"calling
card"
that
would
promote
my
work
and
be
useful
enough
that
people
might
keep
it
around
for
a
while.

As
opposed
to
flyers
business
cards
and
other
crap
I
personally
chuck
when
I
get
home.
1
item
was
not
delivered
in
the
order
,
please
recheck
the
order
of
it's
delivery.
This
was
my
first
time
shopping
with
Western
Bikeworks
and
it
definitely
will
not
be
my
last.
They
have
a
pretty
vast
inventory,
with
adequate
descriptions
and
more
than
satisfactory
photographs.
Their
prices
are
very
good
and
their
shipping
was
speedy.
I
purchased
a
Blackburn
Grocery
Pannier
and
could
not
be
happier.
Was
not
able
to
find
it
at
a
better
price.
Weebly
has
great
customer
service
(complete
with
real
people
and
timely
responses)!
The
website
is
easy
to
use.
There
aren't
a
ton
of
emails
being
sent
thus
clogging
the
inbox.
They
are
fantastic
and
I
will
be
a
lifelong
customer.
Thank
you
Weebly!
I
always
use
this
service....and
i
never
find
a
mistake!
I
wouldn't
recommend
Interparcel
to
anyone.
After
waiting
in
for
an
entire
day
there
courier
did
not
turn
up
to
collect
the
parcel.
I
rang
them
the
next
day
and
was
told
it
wasn't
on
the
system
despite
there
being
a
record
of
the
transaction.
I
was
offered
no
apology.
The
collection
was
then
arranged
for
that
day
and
it
was
picked
up
by
1pm
but
I
was
advised
that
it
could
take
all
day
again.
Poor.
My
recent
order
for
Luigi's
Mansion
2
was
the
first
at
my
new
address,
I
had
updated
my
car
details
and
assumed
the
game
would
be
delivered
here.
I
received
my
dispatch
email
within
minutes
and
I
noticed
on
the
supplied
photo
that
the
parcel
was
going
to
my
previous
address.
I
contacted
them
immediately
and
I
had
the
money
refunded
to
my
Shopto
account
within
the
hour.
I
replaced
the
order
with
the
amended
details
and
after
all
that
happened
I
still
had
the
game
the
next
day.
Free

Cheapest

The
only

I

is,

they
do
it?
Just
excellent.
great
search
I’m
John
from
Georgia
and
I
never
thought
I’d
marry
a
Russian
girl.
I
always
thought
American
girls
are
best
in
the
world
but
after
meeting
Anna,
I
must
say
that
I
was
wrong.
We
met
over
an
internet
marriage
agency
“Nadezhda”;
we
used
to
talk
over
chat
for
hours
and
right
after
a
couple
of
weeks
of
knowing
her,
I
was
certain
that
she
was
the
one
for
me.
I
went
to
meet
her
few
months
back
in
Russian
and
all
those
time
I
felt
like
I
was
flying.
We
married
in
her
home
town
and
here
also
we
had
a
small
reception.
Thanks
Nadezhda.
I
couldn’t
tell
you
how
much
I
appreciate
you
guys.
I
ordered
a
Kayfun
Lite
and
it
must
have
shipped
the
same
day
because
it
made
it
all
the
way
to
the
US
in
under
a
week.

Thank
you
Cloud9Vaping!!!
i
just
wanna
say
that
i
bought
fifa
13
and
i
got
the
product
very
fast...
The
website
is
very
user
friendly
and
the
shipping
was
way
faster
than
I
expected.
I
will
definitely
buy
from
Rep
Fitness
again.
ARV
provided
me
what
I
needed
quickly
and
at
a
fair
price
and
reasonable
shipping.
a
little
disgruntled
that
i
was
billed
twice
for
a
second
time
on
my
purchases,
however
the
team
are
very
efficient
and
hopefully
this
wont
happen
a
third
time.

Despite
this
still
a
5
star
company
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
We
rented
Audi
A4
with
automatic
transmission
and
AC
at
Lisbon
airport
location
right
before
start
of
our
trip
in
Portugal.
Our
experience
with
AutoEurope
was
quite
satisfactory:
on
scale
1
to
10
I
would
give
this
company
8.
I
have
rented
cars
from
Enterprise
coast
to
coast,
cities
from
Honolulu
to
Boston..
The
service
at
LAX
exceeded
dismal.
The
first
car
rented
was
a
Camaro
convertible..
The
roof
release
controls
were

visibly

damaged

and
inoperable..
When
I
advised
the
staff
who
escorted
me
to
the
car
he
asked
if
I
had
broken
the
control.
He
then
took
an
even
longer
period
than
the
initial
sign
in
to
assign

another
car
to
me.
Upon
returning
to
the
LAX
rental
office
the
staff
was
unable
to
decide
whose
responsibility
it
was
to
transport
me
back
to
my
hotel.
After
four
staff
contacts
including
an
onsite
"suit"
who
misinformed
me
they
collection
of
staff
agreed
that
they
could
in
fact
transport
me
from
the
rental
office

to
my
hotel
which
by
the
way
was
adjacent
to
the
airport.
That
time
lost
was
close
to
an
hour.
This
experience
was
completely
inconsistent
with
prior
Enterprise
experiences
and
hopefully
not
a
sign
of
things
to
come..
Easy
no
fuss
and
product
perfect
I
got
there
a
little
later
than
planned
so
there
was
a
wait
but
other
than
that
everything
was
great.

I
came
prepared
with
my
Ipad
do
kill
some
time.
I
first
started
buying
supplements
from
this
site
a
little
over
a
year
ago.
Never
have
had
my
order
messed
up,
the
prices
are
amazing
and
shipping
all
the
way
to
CT
is
very
inexpensive!
I
now
have
all
my
workout
buddies
buying
from
here.
I
plan
on
always
getting
my
supplements
from
here.
Thanks
supplementwarehouse!!!
Bought
a
memory
card
from
MemoryC
at
the
lowest
price
I
could
find
on
the
web
and
got
it
within
2
days.
Great
service.
Must
say
WOW!!!
I
buy
ALOT
of
suppments
for
the
whole
family.
Must
say
BEST
prices
and
if
they
are
not
the
cheapest,
the
price
match
+
5%
is
the
bomb!!!
I
must
have
saved
45.00
dollars
off
my
order
compared
to
other
sites.
WILL
be
back
very
soon.
Patrick
A
great
service.Very
happy
with
them.
Parts
Geek
had
the
three
items
I
needed
in
stock
and
shipped
them
out
immediately,

One
of
those
parts
was
a
specific
door
handle
for
my
Sprinter
sliding
door
and
I
couldn't
believe
they
had
four
in
stock!
I
try
hard
to
find
the
best
prices
on
my
supplements,
I
looked
at
a
lot
of
websites
for
about
2
hours
and
I
couldn't
find
a
better
price
on
what
I
needed
to
order.

I
have
ordered
from
SupplementWarehouse
a
couple
of
times
now
and
have
been
EXTREMELY
satisfied.

Not
only
have
I
ordered
from
them
but
also
3
of
my
workout
buddies
have
done
the
same.

We
all
are
very
impressed
and
will
recommend
this
site
to
anyone.
from
the
first
phone
call
regarding
a
spare
part
for
my
oven
the
service
was
first
class,the
part
was
the
same
as
I
researched
so
it
matched
.
also
I
had
delivery
options,so
I
chose
standard
delivery,
and
the
part
arrived
sooner
than
expected,bonus!!!!

will
use
again,if
needed!.
i
have
been
buying
drinks
from
them
for
sometime
now,
the
selection
is
super,and
delivery
is
on
time.
super
service.
does
what
it
says
on
the
tin
!!!!!!!!
i
think
the
sizeing
is
a
little
bit
out
until
you
get
it
,but
a
fast
return
service
puts
that
right.
however
the
return
label
is
not
acceptable
in
post
offices
so
you
have
to
pay.also
ithink
customer
services
need
to
listen
to
their
phone
messages
as
i
left
many
without
areply.
Thanks
Brilliance.com.
I
ordered
a
beautiful
1
carat
diamond
from
brilliance.com
and
received
it
quickly.
I
had
the
diamond
checked
by
my
local
jeweler
and
they
said
that
the
diamond
was
exactly
as
described.
The
diamond
apparised
for
almost
double
what
I
paid.
The
customer
service
was
very
helpful
and
answered
all
of
my
questions.
My
future
wife
loves
her
diamond
and
shows
it
off
to
everyone.
I
would
recommend
brilliance.com
to
anyone
looking
for
a
loose
diamond.
Tile
fix
direct
did
a
prompt
price
match
for
me
and
gave
me
a
code
to
use
on
their
website
which
work
as
promised
.
They
then
delivered
on
the
day
scheduled,I
would
certainly
use
them
again!
Really
good
guys,
thanks
a
million
for
good
service
and
top
product.
Will
use
again
Top
notch,
as
specified,
helpful
and
cheaper
than
others!
Very
easy
process
of
ordering
at
a
great
price
with
very
good
customer
service
but
computer
was
ordered
as
a
Christmas
present
a
month
in
advance
and
arrived
on
Christmas
eve!
Leaving
it
late
a
bit!
I
have
had
coverage
on
electronics
through
the
places
I
have
purchased
them
in
the
past
and
have
had
the
hassle
of
it's
not
covered
for
that
or
we
cant
find
you
in
our
system.
When
I
came
across
SquareTrade
I
bought
the
coverage
not
knowing
how
they
were.
I
bought
it
because
it
was
very
inexpensive.
To
register
my
purchase
on;ine
with
SquareTrade
was
so
simple.
Then
it
happened....I
had
to
file
a
claim....That
was
easy
too.
It
was
covered.
They
emailed
me
a
shipping
label.
I
boxed
up
the
covered
item
and
mailed
it
out
and
bam...I
received
the
amount
of
the
covered
item
and
purchased
a
new
one.
couldn't
have
been
any
easier.
Now
I
only
use
SquareTrade
to
cover
all
my
electronic
purchases.Thanx
SquareTrade.
IMPECCABLE.
Booked
within
24
hrs
of
departure
and
could
not
get
a
flight
so
tried
to
cancel
an
hour
after
booking
and
got
no
response
until
next
day
saying
they
still
had
to
charge
me
for
one
full
day
plus
taxes
regardless
if
i
had
cancelled
within
hours
of
booking
it
.

Stay
away
from
this
service
Got
everything
I
need
to
keep
my
truck
up
to
snuff
Quik
delivery
too!
Overall,
the
entire
experience
was
excellent.
I
would
have
rated
5
stars
only
for
the
slight
confusion
with
the
initial
order.
The
email
'specials'
shows
pricing
ex-VAT.
(The
lower
value
catches
our
attention.)
But
when
I
followed
the
link
to
make
a
purchase,
the
pricing
included
VAT.
My
fault
for
not
reading
the
fine
print
but
that
confusion
added
a
LOT
of
extra
time
to
the
ordering
process.
orderd
a

it

it
came
in

parts
geek
and
there
is
no
way
of
getting

not
happy
with
the
service
and
the
abuse
of
the
delivery
I
love
this
site,
it
is
geard
toward
riders,
not
squids.

The
selection
is
great,
the
prices
very
competitive
and
the
customer
service
is
friendly
and
helpful.

The
videos
are
really
helpful
and
always
spot-on
regarding
fit,
and
features.
I
always
look
here
first.

2014.


My
wife
and
I
were
scheduled
to
fly
from
Toronto
to
London
flight
BA-98
at
9:20pm
with
a
connecting
flight
to
Deseldorf
flight
BA-938
9:15am.
We
were
excited
for
our
trip
and
had
no
idea
was
ahead
of
us.
The
day
I
got
the
original
suit
and
tried
it
on,
I
realized
I
need
a
larger
one.

I
then
went
on
your
web
site
and
filled
out
the
necessary
form
for
a
return.

Also
stating
in
the
comment
section,
“would
like
to
return
for
a
size
52”.

The
next
morning
I
called
ya’ll
to
make
sure
you
had
a
size
52
and
to
also
make
sure
I
wasn’t
forgetting
anything.

The
guy
I
spoke
with
said
there
were
plenty,
not
to
worry.

That
day
after
work,
I
sent
it
back.

I’m
not
trying
to
bust
any
balls,
but
at
that
time,
someone
knew
a
suit
was
being
returned
for
a
different
size.

At
that
time,
one
would
think
that
suit
would
be
then
put
some
place
separate,
for
the
already
paid
customer.

Once
the
suit
I
sent
got
to
your
shop,
I
got
an
email
that
informed
me
that
they
didn’t
have
a
52
in
black,
only
white.

After
a
mild
heart
attack,
I
decided
to
get
the
white
one.

With
this
suit
being
such
a
great
deal,
it’s
the
quality
not
the
color
that’s
going
to
save
my
ass.

So
I’ll
just
go
with
white
and
deal
with
it.

Other
than
that,
you
guys
rock!!
I
had
placed
an
order
amazed
with
the
prices,
I
then
read
some
reviews
from
upset
customers.
I
read
more
and
was
worried
about
what
I
was
getting.
I
have
no
idea
what
the
people
that
were
complaining,
were
complaining
about.
My
order
arrived
very
fast
AND
with
everything
I
ordered.
I
am
very
pleased
and
will
be
ordering
again.
This
order
wasn't
our
first
with
patches4pennies.
The
owner
and
personnel
are
great.
Their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
and
they
keep
in
touch
with
you
during
the
whole
process;
and
the
turn
around
time
is
very
quick.
Thanks
again
for
your
wonderful
service.
Very
slow
for
part
return!!
Partsgeek.com
gave
me
the
run
around
for
a
part
return.
They
do
not
answer
their
phones
either.
I
ordered
exhaust
for
my
truck
and
they
didnt
inform
me
it
was
for
the
half
yr
after
mine
and
when
i
got
it
and
reliezed
the
problem
i
couldnt
talk
to
a
actual
person
it
was
all
by
email
and
they
wouldnt
even
help
me
with
my
problem
all
they
said
was
that
they
didnt
carry
the
product
i
wanted
and
didnt
ask
me
about
shipping
it
back
and
so
i
decided
to
make
it
work
myself
which
i
shouldnt
have
to
i
would
give
them
no
stars
if
i
could
I
have
been
searching
for
quite
some
time
for
a
place
to
buy
quality
magnets
to
help
me
recover
my
health.

A
heart
attack
warned
me
that
I
needed
to
make
changes.

A
ton
of
reading
has
helped
point
me
in
the
right
direction,
but
that
isn't
the
whole
battle.

Knowing
what
you
need
and
being
able
to
find
it
are
drastically
different
things.

From
my
reading
I
have
no
doubt
that
magnetic
therapy
will
do
great
things
for
my
health
and
now
I
have
found
where
to
get
the
items
that
will
make
that
happen.
great
service,
what
was
ordered
Supplement
Warehouse
is
the
only
company
I
will
order
my
supplements
from.
They
have
amazingly
low
prices
and
if
you
somehow
find
your
item
cheaper
on
somewhere
else,
SW
will
match
then
beat
that
price
by
5%;
they
show
you
how
important
your
are
as
a
customer
to
them
whereas
other
sites
basically
say
pay
our
price
or
go
elsewhere.
Some
people
complain
about
the
shipping
costs,
but
SW
offers
a
ton
of
free
items,
samples
and
magazine
subscriptions,
so
it
balances.
I
am
a
110%
satisfied
customer
of
SupplementWarehouse
and
will
continue
to
do
business
with
them,
for
as
long
as
they
are
around.
Thank
you
Supplement
Warehouse
for
allowing
me
to
afford
my
supplements
and
reach
my
fitness
goals.
Did
not
even
have
a
chance
to
see
the
full
passing
of
estimated
3-6
days'
wait
as
the
phone
was
unlocked
on
the
4th
day
(and
not
even
by
the
end
of
if),
no
frictions
since
paying,
no
frictions
in
iTunes
while
waiting
for
the
"Unlocked"
message.
Simply,
my
gratitude
to
the
commitment
of
the
"MyIMEIUnlock"
team.

sssssssssssssssssssssssss
Have
used
Zappr
twice
now,
no
real
problems
either
time
and
do
seem
to
get
a
little
more
back
from
them
against
the
others
available.
My
only
slight
problem
is
the
payment
is
by
cheque,
not
paid
directly
into
your
account.
The
cheques
both
took
a
few
days
to
arrive,
then
you
have
to
wait
for
them
to
clear,
not
that
I
needed
the
money
quickly,
but
it's
worth
notin.
Other
than
this
would
definately
use
them
again.
Excellent
service,
best
online
price
and
received
the
next
working
day,
what
more
could
you
want?
I've
ordered
a
couple
of
times
now,
the
latest
was
the
best.
Ordered
3
items
lunchtime
on
a
Tuesday,
they
arrived
on
the
Wednesday
morning
and
with
FREE
delivery.
They
also
tend
to
be
cheaper
than
the
others
on
the
majority
of
products
with
a
good
selection.
All
in
all,
a
very
good
company
to
deal
with,
Great
service,
delivered
following
day
FREE!
Pity
the
products
only
average
but
you
can't
win
em
all.
Unfortunately
I'm
not
able
to
order
as
often
as
I'd
like
but
when
I
do
really
appreciate
the
service
from
B&H
Photo.

Their
website
is
easy
to
navigate
and
the
check
out
is
a
breeze.

I
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
requires
quality
equipment
with
competitive
prices.
I
ordered
two
rotors
and
a
day
or
so
later
the
order
was
cancelled
due

to
the
items
not
being
in
stock.
Ive
never
been
one
for
supplements
because
of
all
the
extra
stuff
in
them
that
you
dont
need
or
dont
know
about
so
when
i
heard
of
TPW
i
was
in
disbelief.
To
my
suprise
they
have
exceded
on
all
levels.
Not
only
do
they
offer
a
brilliant
range
of
products
they
also
have
the
best
range
of
flavours
i
have
ever
laid
eyes
on.
The
service
and
the
product
are
absolute
quality
and
are
worth
more
than
the
pittance
they
charge.
The
highlight
for
me
is
the
facility
to
create
your
own
protein
blend.
How
can
you
beat
being
able
to
get
the
products
you
want
exactly
the
way
you
want
it.
Major
brands
be
ware
as
TPW
is
beating
you
all
hands
down.
Fact!
its
the
2nd
time
i
have
used
these
guys
and
they
have
come
good
again
100%
record
so
far..
i'm
a
big
fan
of
my
oral
electric
toothbrush.
but
the
cost
of
replacement
heads
are
a
pricey,
so
i
decided
to
surf
the
net
to
see
to
get
them
cheaper
buying
in
bulk,
or
if
there
was
an
alternative.
luckily
i
landed
on
molarcleans
site,
so
i
thought
i'll
give
them
a
go.
as
far
as
the
product
goes
its
slightly
different
to
the
original
head,
not
that
its
an
issue.
after
using
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks
cleaning
wise
theres
no
difference

using
the
molarclean
head.
price
wise
though
there
is.
i'm
now
a
fan
of
molarclean,
when
we've
used
this
batch
i'll
be
back
for
more.
Only
one
thing,
I
would
like
to

know
the
locations
of
the
warehouses
so
I
can
calculate
shipping
times,
they
do
not
show

o
did
not
have
some
things
in
stock,kept

I
used
Jacada
to
book
my
honeymoon
and
it
was
the
best
decision
I’ve
ever
made.

Our
agent
was
Samantha
Kelly
and
despite
the
incessant
questions,
she
was
always
incredibly
patient
and
attentive
to
all
our
requests.

All
of
the
accommodations
and
events
that
she
recommended

stunning

perfectly

tastes.

The

and
the

all
were
organized

I've
bought

@
3
different
times
in
1
month
from
you
and
Never
got
email
confirmation
that
product
was
sent
out.
The
wait

for

was
to
long
I
called
3
times
and
I
was
on
hold
for
a
rep
for
over
15
min
each
time.
My
order
arrived
promptly
and
was
all
correctly
packed
and
packaged.
I
would
really
recommend

Would
recommend

anyone.
Always
has
the
best
items

and
they
always

in

great

This

I

This

The

fit
perfectly

The
only
real
complaint
I
have
about
Onnit
is
the
prices
of
some
of
their
prices.
That
aside
I
think
Onnit
is
truly
an
amazing
company.
I
have
seen
a
company
so
committed
to
their
goal
of
supplying
their
customers
with
the
best
products
they
can
find.
I
look
forward
to
seeing
what
they
have
in
store
for
the
future.

Never

ordering
through
B&H.
They
have
what
I
need,
prices
are
competitive
and
shipping
on
the
East
Coast
is
always
prompt.
I
ordered
a
part
for
my
2005
Mustang
GT
which
arrived
as
promised
by
Parts
Geek.

The
only
problem
is,
they
"bent"
the
part
in
half
in
an
undersized
box
to
ship
it
in,
now
granted
the
part
was
plastic
but
come
on!!!
It
wasn't
supposed
to
be
bent
at
all
and
they
should
have
shipped
it
in
an
appropriately
sized
box
since
they
charged
me
for
shipping
to
begin
with.

Very
poor
decision.

This
will
prevent
me
from
ordering
anything
from
them
again
regardless
of
price
as
I
have
no
idea
as
to
what
condition
the
parts
may
be
in
when
they
reach
me.
Great
service,
quick
and
easy.

Will
use
again!

I
broke
our
2004
Chevy
door
handle
when
freezing
rain
hit
our
area
and
the
driver's
door
became
frozen
in
place.
We
ordered
the
part
at
a
fair
price,
had
it
shipped
at
a
bit
of
expense,
(shipping
was
about
50%
of
the
cost
of
the
handle);
it
arrived
in
approximately
3
days
and
I
had
it

installed
in
about
and
hour...Now
I
have
to
order
the

I
broke
it
yesterday
during
another

guess
you
should
order
2
at
a
time
to
save
on

The
part
is
as
good
looking
as
the
original
and
it
seems
to
work
well,

it
has

was
still
a

I
always

Where
do
I
start?

I
ordered
all
the
parts
to
do
a
complete
brake
job
on
my
Mercedes
C230,
two
sets
of
rotors
and
pads.

Everything
seemed
to
go
smoothly
till
I
got
an
email
saying
I
was
getting
a
refund.

Apparently
they
could
not
ship
me
the
two
front
rotors
and
were
issuing
a
refund.

That
wasn't
going
to
help
me
get
the
job
done
so
I
called
them.

For
whatever
reason,
they
did
not
have
the
zimmerman
rotors
in
stock
even
though
the
website
said
they
were
available.

So
we
ended
up
on
a
set
of
brembo
rotors
instead.

The
rotors
were
a
couple
of
dollars
more
which
was
ok,
but
I
told
them
I
wasn't
paying
anymore
shipping
charges
to
which
he
agreed.

All
the
parts
came
in

enough
and
I
was
happy
with
that.

recognised

what

all

Due
giorni
dopo

da

mi
spiega
che
purtroppo
non

fatt
in

a

il
camion
per
il
trasporto
il
giovedì
stabilito,
ma
che
l'avrebbero
fatto
il
giovedì
successivo.

subito
pensato
"ecco
mi
sono
preso
la
fregatura"
ed
invece
come
mi
avevano
detto
telefonicamente
le

sono
arrivate.
Alla

devo
dire
che
ho

molto
apprezzato
la

di
essere

transaction
was
perfect.
The
part
had
matched
the
description
on
the
partsgeek
website
and
was
shipped
out
in
a
timely
manner.
I've
been
in
the
automotive
business
for
35+
years,
and
these
guys
have
good
quality
parts
at
reasonable
prices
and
in
some
cases
free
shipping
to
boot.
I
find
it
pretty
nice
that
they
can
actually
undercut
my
regular
parts
supplier
by
quite
a
bit
on
price.
I'll
definitely
do
business
with
them
again!
(Oh,
and
shipping
was
quick
too.)
This
company
is
really
good
to
deal
with,
fast,
efficient
and
helpful!!
I
tend
to
buy
a
lot
of
bike
parts
online
and
usually
Merlin
has
the
edge
in
terms
of
price
over
the
other
big
online
cycle
retailers,
their
delivery
is
free
and
really
fast
and
they
seem
to
carry
an
awful
lot
of
stock,
I
have
had
no
reason
to
contact
their
customer
service,
so
cannot
comment
on
that,
but
I
guess
that
is
good
thing
in
its
self!
All
great
things
to
say
about
the
Servcorp
team
in
Chicago!

Top-notch,
professional,
and
reliable.
Servcorp
has
truly
made
our
day
to
day
lives
much
more
manageable
with
everything
they
do
for
us.

Thank
you

the
great
work!
I
purchased
a
wheel
for
my
2010
kia
koup.

I
ordered
the
part
based
on
the
picture
and
part
number
on
parts
geek's
web
site.

They
shipped
me
the
wrong
wheel
with
the
correct
part
#.
There
is
no
live
customer
support
all
customer
support
is
done
via
email.

No
one
answers
the
800
#
so
don't
waste
your
time
calling.

To
top
it
off
it
took
over
3
weeks
to
finally
get
a
refund
and
they
billed
me
for
shipping
the
original
item
even
though
I
never
received
the
correct
item.


Best
advice
stay
away
from
parts
geek
I
received
my
product
in
a
timely
fashion.
Could
not
ask
for
any
better
service.
Everything
was
perfect.
Fort
Knox
safes
are
the
best
and
helped
to
ensure
I
got
the
safe
configured
the
way
I
wanted
it.
Shipped
grill
for
truck
in
a
huge
box,
way
too
big
for
the
part
ordered,
and
didn't
put
and
packing
material
inside
whatsoever,
no
peanuts,
cardboard
spacers,

nothing.
When
i
opened
it
up
it
was
broken.
This
is
ridiculous
and
idiotic
on
their
part
to
not
pack
an
item
properly.
Would
NOT
advise
buying
from
Parts
Geek.
Good
descriptions,
competitive
pricing,
and
always
delivers.

I
will
gladly
give
them
the
5
stars
they
deserve.
Got
the
order
in
record
time,
fresh
and
undamaged.

As
long
as
the
price
remains
stable
I
will
continue
to
use
petflow.
I
had
to
replace
my
muffler
on
my
car
and
i
looked
at
my
local
stores
and
they
were
more
then
partsgeek.
I
ordered
and
the
parts
came
fast
and
they
all
fit
very
well.
Please
with
the
service
and
seem
to
have
the
consumer
at
heart!
They
have
gone
the
extra
mile
for
me
on
many
occasions.
I
needed
to
send
a
large
parcel
to
the
USA
from
the
UK.
Found
parcelhero
on
the
net,
who
found
me
the
lowest
economy
price
for
delivery.
Fast
shipping
great
prices.
Even
after
paying
shipping
on
a
water
heater
from
American
RV
CO,
it
was
still
cheaper
than
Camping
World
with
a
30%
discount.,
Will
shop
their
website
again.
The
vacation
had
to
be
something
special
for
our
50th
wedding
anniversary.
We
took
our
family
with
us.

Our
agent
had
us
covered
on
everything
including
airport
arrival,
hotels,
transportation,
and
tours,

They
even
called
us
twice
,
once
at
each
hotel,
to
see
if
we
had
any
problems.

I
think
that
they
were
excellent
to
work
with
Hard
to
find
Wellness
GMO-Free
cat
food.
Now
it
comes
right
to
our
front
door!
Once
you
have
created

it's

and

VERY
FAST,

Excellent

!
I
shall
recommend
Company

to
all
I
know
&
will
use
their
services
again.
The

The
price
I
found
on
North
Shore
was
the
cheapest
I
could
find
for
this
product.


I
would
purchase
from
them
again.
BECAUSE
IM
AN
APPLE
FAN-BOUY.

THERE'S
NO
SUBSTITUTE.
I
was
browsing
the
web
for
the
cheapest
but
decent
protein
powders
and
came
across
the
product
I
ended
up
buying.

I

searched
the
web
for
the
cheapest
company
that
sell
the
product

and
the
cheapest
was
Dolphin.

I
thought
because
they
were
the
cheapest
then
there
would
be
a
hefty
delivery
charge
due
to
the
1KG
weight
of
my
powder.
However
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
free
P&P,
and
to
top
it
all
off
it
was
delivered
the
next
day
and
I
tracked
the
package
all
the
way
from
Brighton,
to
Poole
to
my
address.

Outstanding
service
by
this
independent
seller
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
I
will
be
ordering
from
them
in
the
future
(as
long
as
they
ignore
the
inflation
rates!!!!).

Top
seller.
My
daughter
was
wanting
some
Slash
picks
-
she
found
them
at
Peaches.
Good,
easy
to
use
website,
wide
range
and
variety
of
items,
good
prices,
and
very
fast
delivery,
even
during
the
Christmas
rush.
The
merchant
did
an
excellent
job
of
processing
my
order
and
getting
it
to
me.
A
good
job
and
there
is
nothing
more
I
can
say.iphone
The
roman
blinds
we
ordered
for
our
lounge
window
were
perfect
for
the
job.
We
ordered
2
larger
blinds
(1100x2000mm)
and
one
smaller
(510x2000mm)
in
fogal
ivory
material
to
fit
in
an
awkwardly
shaped
recess.
We
tried
looking
around
in
shops/online
for
off-the-shelf
blinds
but
nothing
was
suitable
size-wise.
I
ordered
a
new
tailgate
handle
for
my
truck
and
the
part
was
shipped
very
fast
and
arrived
in
perfect
condition.
I
am
very
happy
with
this
company
and
will
surely
do
business
with
them
again!
The
replacement
Brembo
front
brake
rotors
I
bought
for
my
Honda
Pilot,
supposedly
Brembo
is
the
OEM
manufacturer,
are
actually
made
in
China-not
from
Italy.
Had
I
know
that,
I
could
have
bought
the
Mountain
brand
front
brake
rotors
that
are
made
in
Japan
for
a
few
dollars
more.
I
simply
want
to
stay
away
from
any
replacement
parts
made
in
China
which
I
consider
of
inferior
quality.
Service
super!

Best
price
I
could
find
for
the
product
I
ordered
and
the
fact
that
it
was
shipped
by
DHL
was
awesome,

wasn't
a
ripoff
(as
lots
of
companies
try
to
nail
you
for)
full
tracking
and
emails
to
say
when
delivered
and
such,
fully
kept
me
in
the
picture
and
gave
me
the
feeling
everything
was
efficient
and
this
was
a
business
that
knew
what
it
was
doing!
Literally
blown
away
at
the
delivery
speed,
quality
packaging,
and
care
that
went
into

I
was

and
able

Showerdoc
is
a
fantastic
one-stop
shop
for
shower
spares.

These
guys
have
a
great
range
of
parts
and
the
website
is
so
easy
to
use.

Best
bit
is
being
able
to
view
a
large
image
of
the
part
you
need
to
confirm
it's
the
right
one.

Prices
are
good
(especially
when
you
consider
the
price
and
hassle
of
ditching
your
old
shower
and
fitting
a
new
one
for
lack
of
a
spare
part)
and
my
delivery
was
next
working
day.

Already
recommended
a
mate
at
work
to
check
the
site
out
for
a
new

for
his

Fantastic!!

I
ordered
a
book
listed
in
"fair"
condition
with
markings
and
possible
highlighting.
When
the
book
arrived,
it
was
practically
new.
I
was
impressed
with
the
packaging
materials
Bookbyte
utilized
and
that
the
book
was
delivered
within
the
delivery
window
they
specified.
I
will
order
through
this
vendor
again
in
future.
This
was
a
great
experience.
I
got
the
correct
parts
first
time
and
shipping
was
cheap,
even
free
on
some.
Got
all
my
parts
in
2
days.
I
booked

with

hours...on
hold
3
times
totaling
45
minutes...couldn't
find
my
itinerary.....then
after
all
said
and
done....charged
my
credit
card
the
full
amount....good
service
if
there
no
problems...but
need
some
customer
service
and
forget
it....side
note....the
people
ya
deal
with
speak
very
rudimentary
English
so
huge
communication
gap
on
top
of
incompetence..
I
really
liked
the
look
of
the
web
site
and
the
reviews
shown
on
the
right
hand
side
so
felt
confident
in
ordering.
Prior
to
this
I'd
get
my
jerseys
etc
from
the
likes
of
Foska
but
the
SG
items
look
so
good
that
I
decided
to
give
these
a
try.
Ordering
was
easy,
really
like
the
free
postage
and
when
the
top
arrived
it
was
superb,
fitted
perfectly
and
I
didn't
know
I
was
wearing
it.
I
like
the
idea
of
wearing
something
that
at
the
time
only
a
few
would
have
had
so
some
very
limited
editions
jerseys
(retro
or
otherwise)
would
be
an
excellent
idea.

All
worked
well,
the
only
issues
were
ones
that
I
created
for
myself
causing
the
carrier
to
deliver
to
the
wrong
office
in
the
building
but
I
can't
really
blame
The
Warehouse
for
that.
Fast
and
efficient
Great
products,
great
speed
on
shipping
but
prices
are
a
little
high
on
most
of
the
items.
My
call
was
picked
up
within
five
seconds.

I
explained
by
problem,
and
I
was
told
"no
problem."

It
was
no
problem,
the
tech
support
fixed
my
issue
and
I
was
back
on
the
site
in
less
than
one
minute.

And
yes
the
fix
did
work.
i
ordered
two
window
motors
and
regulators
they
arrived
promptly.
both
items
were

easy
to
install
and
work
well

They
provide
us
with

every

Identity
Guard
does
provide
a

but
since
one
of
the
primary
reasons
for
paying
for
their

is
to
protect
my

and
respond
quickly
to
anything
that

having

more
than

one
of

I

I
am
disappointed
with

As

Veteran
I
always
get
a
discounted
booking
from
hampton
inns
and
there
is
apparently
no
place
to
request
such
discount
on
your
website.


Not
only
that,
but
my
card
was
charged
for
both
the
booking
and
a
$40.00
incidental
charge.


When
I
checked
out
another
card
was
charged
for
the
room
at
a
different
rate
and
I
have
yet
to
receive
an
adjustment
back
for
the
erroneous
charge
or
the
incidental
charge
of
which
I
had
no
charges.



I
have
called
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
he
promises
a
return
call
to
resolve
on
Monday!


Not
sure
who
caused
the
problem,
but
not
happy
about
it.
Very
good

The

is
not
as
clear

as

I
ended
up

If

do
it!!
Do
not
subjugate

hard
to
find
parts
did
for
me
anyway
would
use
again.
Unexpectedly
awesome
products
for
a
low
price


Soooo
incredibly
happy
with
the
sash
I
purchased
!!!!!
I
used
3000rpm
to
repair
my
broken
laptop
screen,
the
staff
were
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
job
was
done
within
15/20
minutes,quick
and
easy
and
would
definitely
use
them
again
if
needed.
My
only
slight
concern
was
the
£50
labour
charge
seemed
a
tad
expensive
for
15/20
minutes
work
but
overall
a
good
service.
Everything
is
very
easy
with
this
people!
I
LOVE
THIS
SHOP!!
I
ordered
a
heater
core
for
my
1968
Chrysler,
and
got
the
last
premium
one
they
had.
The
packaging
and
tracking
information
assured
a
safe
delivery.
Excellent
Customer
service
and
prompt
delivery
Ordered
Asics
Trainers,
Socks
and
Sweatpants,
all
arrived
as
ordered
and
lovely
items,
will
be
using
Barrington
Sports
for
all
my
purchases.
From
my
call
with
a
knowledgeable
assistant
I
was
confident
in
receiving
good
service
and
that
is
exactly
what
I
got
plus
my
goods
arrived
sooner
than
expected.



Thank
you
and

I
will
certainly
shop
again
at
Taunton
Leisure.
Easy
to
use
service
with
lots
of
choices.
Am
reviewing
before
the
actual
trip,
but
thus
far
its
been
very
easy
to
deal
with
them.
The
technician
was
very
personable
and
knowledgeable.
He
covered
all
the
items
with
me,
explaining
them
simply
and
understandably.
I
was
amazed
at
how
he
saw
the
flaws
from
the
previous
company,
and
corrected
them.
Amazing
selection,
great
prices,
immediate
ordering
and
shipping.
They
have
all
the
items
that
hardware
stores
just
don't
carry
anymore.
Prices
are
easily
50%
less
than
the
hardware
store
and
even
some
specialty
fastener
stores
on
common
items.
Don't
get
me
wrong,
I
did
not
make
a
complex
order
(if
there
is
such
a
thing)
but
from
order
to
delivery
was
just
perfect.
We're
all
pretty
busy
in
this
modern
day
and
when
we
make
orders
online
we
don't
need
any
hassle.
one
of
the
best
bike
sites
i
have
visited
and
the
sevice
was
speedy
Order
was
delivered
perfectly
as
described
I
found
my
experience
with
Envirofone
a
very
pleasant
one
.
Lisa
your
sales
rep
was
so
pleasant
and
helpful
that
I
will
work
only
with
your
company!!!

I

SO
GET
A
NEW
BACKUP
As
a
USAA
employee
and
tenant
of
ServCorp,

I
could
not
be
more
pleased
with
the
service
and
treatment
I
have
gotten
here.

Lisa
and
Leah
always
go
out
of
their
way
to
treat
me
and
my
clients
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
consideration.

In
fact,
many
of
my
clients
think
these
young
ladies
are
USAA
employees!
Merlin
had
the
best
price
by
far
and
shipping
to
USA
was
fast
and
easy.
I
will
look
at
their
site
for
any
bike
gear
purchase
from
now
on.
I
have
never
ordered
truck
parts
on-line
before
and
was
a
little
apprehensive,
but
after
shopping
around
on-line,
and
seeing
what
a
great
deal
I
was
getting
from
PartsGeek
I
decided
to
give
it
a
try.

My
parts
arrived
quickly
and
were
the
exact
parts
I
needed.

I'm
all
about
saving
money
both
in
the
price
of
the
parts
and
in
not
having
to
driving
around
to
find
them.

Both
were
accomplished
by
ordering
from
PartsGeek.

I'll
be
ordering
again
soon!
Fantastic
quick
delivery
and
a
good
price.
Overall
great
service
Ordered
parts
from
ARVC
before
and
never
had
problems.
The
sales
rep,
Tashim,
was
excellent.

I
had
put
through
an
order
online
a
few
days
earlier.

The
tires
were
ready
at
the
day
and
time
promised.

I
walked
in
and
my
car
was
being
worked
on
within
10
minutes.

Tashim
explained
everything
that
they
were
going
to
do,
the
specs
on
the
tires
and
what
they
meant,
and
all
the
warranties
and
post-installation
service
that
I
got
for
buying
my
tires
at
Town
Fair
Tire.

What
made
the
experience
with
Tashim
stand
out
was
that
he
took
the
time
to
explain
to
me
in
terms
I
could
understand.

He
translated
all
the
technical
industry
jargon
to
something
that
me
(a
layman)
could
comprehend.
Yes,
I
would
shop
there
again,
can't
beat
the
prices
and

service
From
the
first
call
I
felt
comfortable
in
the
fact
that
the
Qiklaw
assc.
showed
a
keen
interest
in
my
particular
case
for
several
reasons,
the
age
of
the
case,possible
difficulties
with
locating
files
or
files
that
may
have
been
purged.throughout
whole
process,
Qiklaw
specialist
were
honest,
timely,
and
very
efficient.
the
lines
of
communication
were
always
open,even
on
that
occasional
Saturday.
The
speed
of
turnaround
is
great.
The
first
transcript
was
excellent
but
the
most
recent
one
is
full
of
mistakes.
The
designated
speaker
is
wrong
and
this
is
from
a
VIDEO
so
you
can
see
who
is
speaking.
Many
of
the
word
are
really
wrong
and
I've
had
to
go
back
and
watche
the
video
and
correct
the
whole
thing.
Ordered
a
rebuilt
water
pump
and
water
inlet
tube.

Shipped
promptly
and
installed
OK.

Had
to
use
the
old
o
ring
on
the
tube
since
the
new
one
wouldn't
fit
and
make
a
tight
seal.
I
had
been
looking
for
a
Condor
Parang.
I
had
found
and
tried
two
places
online
before
finding
Heinnie
Haynes.
The
first
told
me
the
knife
would
be
back
in
stock
in
a
fortnight
and
nothing
more.
The
second
took
my
order
and
I
still
(2
weeks
later)
have
had
no
contact
from
them.
I
placed
an
order
with
Heinnie
Haynes
in
the
and
received
an
email

shortly
after
to
say
that
it
had
been
dispatched.
It
arrived
the
next
day.
I
thought
it
was
advertised
as
coming
with
a
sheath,
but
it
clearly
states
otherwise.
Possibly
the
picture
including
a
sheath
helped
me
misread
the
description
in
my
haste.
It
cost
a
couple
of
quid
more
than
the
other
places
I
tried,
but
nothing
extra
for
carriage
-
and
as
I
said,
it
arrived
less
than
24
hours
after
being
ordered
and
communication
was
very
good,
too.
Unable
to
source
items
required
in
high
street
stores
but
found
it
straight
away
at
cult
pens.
Easy
to
navigate
website
and
the
cheapest
prices
on
the
web
(if
you
can
find
cheaper
they
will
beat
it).
Plenty
of
samples
and
free
deals/great
sales.
Supplement
warehouse
is
hands
down
by
far
the
place
to
shop
for
your
supplementing
needs.
Very
easy
to
use.
Quick
and
easy
to
make
payment
and
we've
used
this
company
many
times
when
going
away.
They
have
always
been
there
when
they've
said
they
will
be
there
and
the
car
has
always
been
clean
and
with
very
miles
added.
Perfect.
A
stressfree
way
to
start
and
finish
your
holiday.
HH
has
a
great
reputation,
they
are
easily
the
best
company
I
deal
with.
I
have
been
a
customer
for
ten
years
and
have
never
been
let
down,
they
deliver
within
48
hrs
majority
of
time
is
less
than
24
hrs.
My
business
orders
from
e-bottles
because
we
have
found
they
have
the
best
quality
for
a
reasonable
price.
I
have
probably
placed
ten
orders
from
them.

Recently
service
has
gotten
much
slower.
I
have
an
order
that
was
placed
a
month
ago
that
has
yet
to
ship.
Everytime
I
call
I
am
assured
it
has
been
sent
to
the
warehouse.
I
wait
a
few
days
later...no
updates.
The
only
reason
I
am
not
upset
is
because
I
have
not
been
charged
because
they
do
not
bill
until
shipment.
I
placed
a
$1000
order
a
week
ago
(different
size)
and
received
it
no
problem
so
I
have
no
idea
why
the
other
cannot
as
well.
with
the
economy
as
it
is
now
it
is
good
to
know
i
can
find
parts
i
need
to
keep
my
cars
running
without
breaking
my
pocket
book
and
get
excellent
shipping
service
as
well.

Thanks
Great
service
from
Phil.
He

not

a
great

of

but
also
big

amazingly
what
we
were
hoping
for.

Dennis

I

The
stainless
steel
trim
piece
is
a
little
lighter
and
easier
to
bend
than
the
original,
which
might
explain
why
the
part
had
a
slight
bend
on
one
end
and
a
"wavy"
surface
in
the
middle.

I
went
ahead
and
mounted
the
part
anyway
because
I
figured
that
the
quality
of
the
replacement
wasn't
going
to
markedly
improve
with
another
attempt.

Overall
the
ordering
went
great
and
I
was
just
happy
to
get
a
replacement
part
that
looks
OK.

After
all,
it's
not
a
show
car.
I
ordered
a
karaoke
machine
for
my
daughter
and
found
them
to
have
the
best
price
available
online.

And
the
shipping
was
really
quick!
Twice
only
have
I
done
business
with
scooter
centre
.
Both
times
the
items
I
have
ordered
have
arrived
on
time
,
well
packaged
,
and
all
for
a
reasonable
cost
.
Order
some
clothes
which
didn't
quite
fit
and
they
made
the
return
process
really
easy
which
surprised
me,
delivery
was
speedy
as
well!
This
is
really
only
online
clothes
site
I
would
ever
use!
Glasses
were
great
as
was
service
and
delivery.
We
bought
a
bed,
mattress
and
linen
sheets.
Very
easy
and
delivered
within
the
week,
all
unwrapped,
put
together
and
rubbish
taken
away.
Amazing.
The
linen
sheets
though
are
not
so
good,
rough
is
an
understatement.

My
wife
left
the
bed
after
ten
minutes
saying
it
felt
like
she
was
having
a
chemical
peal.
I
washed
the
sheets
eleven
times
over
the
following
days,
eventually
having
to
use
conditioner
even
though
people
say
you
should
not.
I
had
to
go
and
get
cotton
sheets.
The
linen
has
been
put
away,
never
to
be
brought
out
again.
Excellent
service,
prompt
delivery.
Completely
great.

Quick

and
product
arrived

described.

play-asia
is
the
site
you

otherwise

The
transaction
went
well,
and
it
is
very
easy
to
do.
The
website
at
first,
can
be
slightly
confusing
to
look
at,
but
once
you
have
payed
for
one
thing,
you
will
fully
understand
all
of
the
pages
and
procedures,
which
makes
this
site
both
fast
and
easy.
I
love
this
site.

The
products
are
endless,
they
are
cheaper
than
going
to
a
store,
and
most
of
all
they
are
of
the
highest
quality.
The
prices
were
good
for
the
parts
I
was
looking
for,
but
I
did
not
like
the
"partnering"
offers,
and
the
hidden
added
costs
that

would
have
gone
with
them.
It
seemed
an
underhanded
way
to
go
about
things.
I
will
not
buy
from
this
vendor
again,
no
matter
the
price.
Simple

free
experience,
I
have
purchased
3
pairs

Very

way
to

The

I
paid

I'll

I
use

They

I

now

fault
the

superior

and
speed
of

The

Exceptionally
good
service
compared
to
similar
companies
offering
this
type
of
service.
My
fiancee
and
I
were
very
happy
with
this
product.
We
did
have
to
use

to
add
the

we
wanted

but
the

came
out
in
pristine

It
even
looked
better
than
the

Shipping
was
expedient,
and
the
price
was
unbeatable.
I

Created
my
order
from
Denmark
on
Thursday
and
received
my
things
on
Monday.
This
is
the
fourth
appliance
we've
ordered
since
moving
home
in
August.

Delivery
and
service
have
been
excellent
on
every
occasion.

Communication
prior
to
delivery
is
a
real
strength.
Would
recommend
without
reservation.
The
staff
provide
what
is
missing
in
so
many
businesses
today
-
old
fashion
service
and
friendliness.
Bye
the
way
their
prices
are
better
than
anywhere
else.
All
in
all
it
is
a
winning
combination.
After
finally
getting
someone
who
spoke
English,
we
were
directed
to
the
check-in
location
at
the
train
station.

(The
reservation
information
did
not
show
where
at
the
train
station
the

was
located)
Rapid
delivery,
excellent
communication
and
well
packaged
These
guys
responded
almost
immediately
to
the
several
questions
I
had.
Even
though
I
was
a
rank
novice
at
web
page
design,
I
did
not
sense
them
talking
down
to
me.
I
would
definitely
recommend
them.
Order
the
wrong
part
and
immediately
realized
it
and
tried
to
change
the
order.
I
called
and
emailed,
no
answer
and
no
email
response.
So
they
send
me
the
wrong
part
and
now
I
had
to
pay
30
bucks
to
send
it
back
and
a
15%
restocking
fee.
By
the
time
I
get

I
was
looking
to
upgrade
my
MTB
and
searched
the
web
for
deals
and
came
across
Merlin
Cycles.
Not
only
was
the
deal
they
were
offering
for
the
bike
I
wanted
excellent,
but
the
whole
aftersales
process
too.
Delivery
times
was
as
described
and
the
customer
services
quick
to
respond
to
the
additional
queries
I
had
regarding
the
bike.
I
would
have
total
faith
to
buy
online
again
with
Merlin
and
would
recommend
their
service
to
others.
I
travel
a
lot,
therefore
do
not
have
much
time
to
waist.

With
Travelocity
is
easy
to
make
travel
plans,
even
if
it
is
for
someone
else.
I
had
done
research
on
a
few
places
for
tires
and
they
were
all
on
the
upward
of
$600
from
local
places
all
the
way
up
to
$825
from
my
dealer.
I
went
to
Townfair
and
the
gentlemen
that
helped
me
both
last
year
and
this
year
were
very
knowledgeable
and
pleasant
to
interact
with.
I
only
ended
up
spending
just
under
$500
which
was
well
within
my
budget
with
a
few
extra
perks.
I
was
happy
with
the
product
as
well
as
the
price.
Shipping
was
a
lil
slow

my
tastes.

From

some

I

Thanks.
I
would
really
recommend
TransferWise.
I
was,
naturally,
a
bit
sceptical
at
first,
of
handing
over
my
money
to
a
third
party,
but
after
making
several
transfers
with
them,
I
am
very
comfortable
using
their
service.
The
transfers
are
always
made
quickly
and
I
usually
end
up
saving
about
20
pounds
on
each
transfer
as
compared
with
my
bank.
I
will
never
make
another
international
transfer
from
my
bank
again!
Great
service,
great
price,
fast
delivery.
What
more
could
I
want?!
I
ordered
5
parts.

Only
received
4.

Had
to
re-order
the
5th
again
and
pay
extra
shipping.

Tried
calling
and
emailing
with
no
returned
calls
and
the
emails
were
shady
at
best.

Never
received
a
refund
for
the
part
I
never
received.

Don't
think
I
will
be
using
them
again.

Get
some
customer
service
reps
that
answer
the
phone
and
return
calls.
As
said
really.
I
guesss
they
hold
so
much
stock,
it's
pretty
hard
to
NOT
find
what
you're
looking
for,
tennis
related.
Some
end
of
season
stuff,
very
good
value
too!
Now,
if
only
I
was
any
good
at
tennis!
The
product
was
an
excellent
purchase
for
the
price
and
quality.
I
was
extremely
happy
and
pleased
with
the
product.
Got
the
piece
and
wasn't
really
sure
I
had
gotten
the
right
part
since
I'm
not
that
technical
with
cars.
My
heater
fan
switch
was
an
exact
match
and
as
soon
as
I
plugged
it
in
my
fans
were
back
to
working
100%!!
They
made
it
easy
to
track
down
what
I
needed
even
when
I
wasn't
sure!
Thanks

Most

compromise

I
have
always
received
the
reports

timely
fashion

they
contain
the
information
I
need
from
them.
The
initial
feeling
is
one
of
relief,
that
they
have
the
parts
needed
and
at
a
reasonable
price.
The
joy
and

when
the
parts
arrive
in
time
for

akin
to

Thank
you

Fast
trade,
cheap
prices
and
very
user
friendly!
We
have
had
great
success
using
ZipRecruiter!
The
product
is
fantastic
and
the
support
is
even
better.
I've
used
Monster
and
several
others
and
was
not
impressed.
The
very
best
posting
product
in
the
market
today!
Workers
are
always

the

is
usually
quick
and
well
done
As

quickly

correctly.

Never

with

my
go

spot

the
web
for

I
ordered
the
item
late
on
Sunday
evening
and
it
was
delivered
at
about
07.30hrs
on
Monday
morning.
Delivery
team
were
most
helpful
in
taking
the
old
appliance
out
of
the
house.
The
bath/shower
mixer
taps
and
basin
taps
were
delivered
quickly
and
seem
to
be
good
quality
and
value
for
money.

I
shall
be
installing
them
in
the
next
few
days.
I
was
treated
royally,
the
view
was
fantastic,
and
my
pictures
turned
out
great.

The
pilot
was
very
professional
and
took
me
where
I
wanted
to
go.

I
felt
safe
at
all
times.

Even
though
I
was
the
only
passenger
the
did
not
cancel
the
flight.
The
site's
navigation
is
a
little
difficult
to
use,
but
the
prices
are
probably
the
best
on
the
internet.
Also,
the
nutritional
facts
could
be
laid
out
a
bit
better;
I
find
them
difficult
to
read
when
they
are
just
put
in
text
format.
Website

quick
and
easy
to
use
and
the
price
quoted
was
as
good
(and
generally
better)
than
all
of
the
other
sites
I
tried.
I
happened
to
be
near
their
office
a
few
days
later,
so
I
dropped
the

in
by

This
again
was
very
easy

my
full

arrived
a

at

well
as

of

This

BuySpares
staff
were
very
helpfull
with
a
problem
I
had
with
the
delivery
of
their
product
which
was
no
fault
of
theirs.The
product
is
very
good
and
a
great
asset
to
the
oven.
I
found
that
my
dealings
with
HealthExpress
have
been
very
good
apart
from
trying
to
contact
them
by
phone
which
was
very
frustrating
due
to
being
put
on
hold
for
so
long.UPS
said
that
they
were
unable
to
deliver
due
to
the
wrong
address
and
that
I
was
not
available
to
except
the
parcel
which
was
odd
as
I
was
at
home
all
day.As
luck
would
have
it
they
delivered
the
next
day,at
which
point
my
phone
rang
and
it
was
one
of
your
helpfull
staff
who
was
enquiring
about
my
E/mail
and
it
all
ended
satisfactorly.
I
bless
the
day
I
discovered
this

as
they
supply
all

it's
easy

is
second

the

are
first

impressed
with

This

is

Great

I
have
been
very
satisfied
with
the
program
and
I
have
put
my
Wife
on
the
program
as
well.
when
my
car
broke
i
have
find
you.
I'd
been
satisfied
with
PetFlow
the
way
most
of
us
can
be
satisfied
by
impersonal
computer-mediated
transactions,
i.e.,
there
hadn't
been
any
problems.

It's
just
that
they
didn't
seem
to
sell
the
product
we
wanted
our
dog
to
have.

In
fact,
I
think
maybe
they
did,
but
I'd
managed
to
overlook
it.

In
any
case,
I
mentioned
the
reason
for
the
cancellation
in
my
request.

What
stood
out,
to
me,
was
the
response
from
PetFlow's
customer
relations
person:
no
nagging
or
sour
grapes,
just
a
friendly
invitation
to
return
any
time
I
wished,
and
the
merest
mention
that
PetFlow
does
indeed
carry
the
product
in
question.

We
were
about
to

move,
so
I
didn't
immediately
request
resumption
of
deliveries.

But
what
made
a
lasting
impression
was
that
PetFlow
employs
customer
relations
people--or
at
least
one--who
are
well
in
tune
with
what
brings
in
business.
The
website
is
very
well
presented
and
structured,
the
online
ordering
process
was
very
smooth
and
easy.
Also
amazing
delivery
time
to
Germany.
The
jacket
I
bought
is
the
best
price
on
the
internet
and
I
coud
even
choose
a
free
gift.
I
will
certainly
place
other
orders
with
you
and
pass
on
recommendations.
What
a
pleasurable
experience
and
thanks
again
!
Excellent
support
and
assistance
to
enable
me
to
purchase
the
correct

Fast
and
easy
As
I
said
I'm
usually
pleased
with
your
service.
Lately,however,
I've
had

to

Also
I
have

nothing.

I've
been
using
Travelocity

1998.

I
particularly
like
the

When
I
travel
to
Europe,
I
frequently
save
money
by
putting
my
itinerary
together
in
several
pieces.

Combining
that
with
hotel
stays
and
ground
transportation,
I
sometimes
find
it
necessary
to
change
something
by
the
end
of
the
process--and
the
24
hour
grace
period
really
helps
with
this.

I

how
many

I've
turned
on
to
nuts.com
(formerly

through
gift

or
whatever.

I'm

Great

great

BUT
they
put
in
that
extra
effort
to
give
me
an
excellent
service
so
it's
only
fitting
I
give
them
a
wee
review
in
return.
They
were
very
helpful
and
professional
at
all
times.

Off
the
chart
on
the
awesomeness
scale.
If
you
don't
shop
at
their
store
you
should
be
band
from
humanity
and
ostracised
to
planet
stupid
where
they'll
slap
you
in
the
face
and
charge
you
double
to
boot.
Sorry,

off
on
a
bit
of
a
tangent
there
but
I'm
sure
you
get
my
point.
It's
not
like
anyone
will
read
this.
I
bought
something
it
was
good
and
they
delivered
and
it
worked
and
I
liked
it
and
I
kept
it
and
I
and
I
be
a
captain.
Jolly

Fast

Parks
Geek
does
a
fine
job
of
offering
parts
and
prices
are
generally
competitive
pricewise.
Formerly
when
I
bought
parts
there
was
one
shipment
with
one
freight
cost,
or
sometimes
if
you
spent
enough,
shipping
was
free.
Now
they
hit
you
for
a
freight
cost
from
each
warehouse
from
which
your
order
ships.
If
your
order
has
12
items
as
my
last
one
did,
it
could
come
from
4
or
5
warehouses.
Ive
used
this
service
several
times
already
this
year
and
it
is
professional,
reliable
and
good
value.
I
have
always
been
impressed
with
BH.

The
biggest
impression
is
when
you
actually
use
their
bricks
and
mortar
store.

They
bend
over
backwards
to
learn
what
your
need
is,
pull
items
off
the
shelf
for
you
to
try
and
educate
you
about
products
you
may
not
have
heard
off
that
might
meet
that
need.

All
the
while,
you
never
feel
the
pressure
to
buy
but
rather,
evaluate
what
you
have
learned.

It
compels
you
to
make
a
purchase
and
trust
it
was
the
right
purchase
for
you.

Their
online
experience
is
also
healthy.

They
compete
well
on
price.

Their
ordering
is
fast
and
things
are
shipped
without
any
delay.

They
are
closed
for
religious
holidays,
which
can
be
inconvenient
but
commands
respect
in
a
busy
industry.

I
CHOOSE
to
shop
at
B&H.
always
kept
up

and

I
would
not

anywhere

for
appliances
Outstanding

items
packaged
well
and
free

a
bonus
my
tumble
dryer
broke
on
saturday
night
and
i
needed
a
replacement

for
the
following
day.

i
ordered
one
online
and
it
was
delivered
sunday.

unfortunately,
it
didn't
work
and
when
i
spoke
to
appliances
online,
they
added
me
to
their
delivery
schedule
and
replaced
it
on
xmas
eve.
The
part
I
was
looking
for
was
easy
to
find
and
order.
Very
simple,
these
people
offered
the
best
price
on
the
internet,
they
told
me
exactly
when
it
would
be
delivered
and
checked
twice
on
the
phone
that
was
OK,
their
delivery
guys
brought
it
right
into
the
kitchen
...
what
else
could
anyone
want!
The
new
WizMix
range
of
e-liquid
is
the
best
there
is
on
the
market
today.
The
flavours
are
really
strong
and
accurate
so
you
are
not
left
wondering
what
the
flavour
should
be.
Very
highly
recommended,
I
will
not
buy
my
juice
from
anyone
else
now.
I
have
been
using
printing.com's
Northampton
branch.
I
have
always
found
them
helpful,
friendly
and
just
generally
nice
pleasant
people.
I
don't
even
know
how
their
prices
compare
to
other
printers
and
I
probably
wouldn't
change
printers
even
if
others
were
a
bit
cheaper
I've
wanted
to
start
my
own
business
for
years,
and
while
I
have
made
a
good
living,
I
could
never
save
enough
money
for
the
capital
needed
to
start
one.

Financing
Factory
has
given
me
HOPE.

They
have
introduced
me
to
someone
who
has
brought
me
to
a
possible
source
of
financing,
and
I
will
know
in
a
couple
of
days
how
much
money
I
will
qualify
for.

This
is
exciting
because
now
thanks
to
Financing
Factory
I
am
on
the
verge
of
realizing
my
dreams.

Oh
Yes,
I

Col.
Sanders
of
KYC
he
did
not
realize
his
dream
until
he
was
70,
but
he
never
gave
up,
and
neither

I.

Thanks
Financing

giving

HOPE.
AM
OVERALL
PLEASED
WITH
THE

AND
IT

GOOD

Prima

hoor,
wellicht
dat
in
de
toekomst
de

gewoon
ingegeven

100.
We
were
very
pleased
with
the
great
customer
service
and
prompt
attention
to
our
orders.

I
placed
one
order
originally
which
I
had
to
cancel
because
we
found
other
issues
with
vehicle
&
wouldn't
need
the
parts.

I
called
&
spoke
to
someone
who
was
very
helpful
&
cancelled
the
order
with
no
problem.

Very
friendly
&
easy
to
deal
with!

We
then
reordered
the
part
when
we
needed
it
&
we
were
pleased
with
the
communication
from
company
&
the
prompt
shipping
of
item.
I've
been
trying
to
find
the
storage
units
near
by
my
school
and
using
SpareFoot
it
was
super
easy
to
find
the
perfect
storage
place.
Ordered
Warner
brake
pads
from
Parts
Geek.
My
order
arrived
quickly,
it
was
exactly
what
I
asked
for,
very
nice
experience!
I
looked
around
at
different
parts
stores,
(Online
and
in
person...)
they
had
the
best
deal!!!
Would
definitely
recommend
them
to
anyone
that
asks
where
to
go
for
parts!!!
Thanks
Parts
Geek!
I
placed
a
small
order
for
specific
parts.

Shipping
was
prompt.

Packaging
was
appropriate.

Order
contents
were
accurate
and
complete.

Specialized
is
only
45
minutes
from
me,
which
is
also
good
to
know
if
I
had
an
urgent
need.

If
the

are
out
of
stock
they
should
be
back
in
no

so
no
worries
of
not
getting
a
key.
Site
is
perfectly
safe
and
I
got
my
order

I
only
use
your
service
because
of
frequent
coupons...
Grub

It
has
generally
been
really
reliable,
and
the

makes
quick
re-orders
really
simple.
No
complaints

and
the
weekly

bi-weekly

certainly
don't
hurt
either.
Used
the
service
for
the
first
time
booking
accomodation
in
Rome
for
the
summer.
The
B&B
was
booked
in
a
few
clicks
with
the
owner
responding
to
the
booking
in
under
an
hour,
costs
were
confirmed
as
per

Easytobook

also
slightly
cheaper
than

the
same

Will
definetely
use
again.
I

Totally
reliable

I
always

my
friends

people
who
ask

I
get

from..

A
first
choice
for
the
serious
outdoor
shopper..
All
in
all
the
whole
process
was
a
success
on
our
and
OFL's
behalf
due
to
the
high
level
of
friendly
customer
service
we
received
and
fantastic
furntiure
-
could
not
fault
that.
Our
furniture
arrived
as
expected
and
even
got
a
7
day
extension
on
the
original
24
hours
given
to
check
all
the
furniture
thoroughly
(due
to
decorating
we
could
not
un
pack
all
the
boxes
straight
away).
The
only
and
probably
very
trivial
excuse
for
the
mark
down
is
due
to
none
delivery
of
wax.
We
were
warned
that
the
delivery
may
not
turn
up
with
the
tub
of
wax
and
were
even
given
the
chance
to
take
it
away
with
us
in
store
when
we
ordered
our
furniture.
However
on
being
advised
that
delivery
would
be
at
least
7
weeks
away
we
decided
that
if
we
took
the
wax
early
it
would
only
get
mis
placed
and
probaly
lost
-
and
if
it
is
supposed
to
come
with
the
delivery
anyway,
why
should
we.
As
predicted
by
our
very
good
customer
service
rep
-
wax
was
a
no
show
on
delivery
and
i
had
to
call
by
the
store
and
pick
one
up.
My
problem
is
very
simple
-
if
this
is
a
regular
occurence,
as
it
was
very
clearly
pointed
out
to
us
that
it
more
than
likely
would
not
turn
up
on
delivery
as,
'it
never
does'
then
why
don't
OFL
sort
this
unnecessary
glitch
in
the
system
out
rather
than
having
drag
a
customer
back
to
the
store
and
pick
it
up.
Simples.
To
be
honest
my
rating
is
a
4.5,
but
you
can't
give
half
star
ratings.
All
in
all
very
happy
with
our
products

Occasionally,
we
cannot

(incoming

fine)
until

This
has
only
happened
twice
since
activating
the
service,
and
not
sure
if
it
is
a
problem
with
the
device
OR
the
service.
I
have
shopped
on
line
with
B&H
for
many
years
and
find
them
to
be
honest,
reliable
and
competitive,
and
their
stock
is
second
to
none.

I
have
dealt
with
their
customer
service
a
few
times
and
have
found
them
to
be
very
reasonable
and
responsive.

I
consider
B&H
the
gold
standard
of
on
line
shopping.

I
do
like
to
buy
locally
when
the
price
is
right,
but
when
it
is
not
or
I
can't
find
the
item
I
want,
I
head
for
B&H.

They
are
competitive
with
and
I
trust
them
more
than
the
Amazon
third
sellers.
Being
an
old
guy
and
not
computer
adept
means
being
reluctant
to
do
some
things
online.
I
found
the
experience
to
be
easy
and
quick
and
much
cheaper
than
the
remote
parking
lots
at
O'Hare.
Several
good
contacts
came
to
provide
info
and
make
bids.
I
have
an
extremely
challenging
prescription
that
the
local
"big
box
optical
center"
will
not
even
attempt
to
fill
and
the
specialty
optical
shops
I
visited
wanted
thousands
of
dollars
(per
pair)
to
fill
and
limited
me
to
some
very
unattractive
frames.
You
always
feel
a
bit
apprehensive
buying
digital
credit
from
3rd-party
websites.
However,
PC
Game
Supply
has
always
been
trustworthy
and
reliable.
Reasonably
priced,
with
a
turnaround
time
of
5
minutes
maximum
on
your
purchase.
No
effort
was
made
to
get
me
the
correct
part
or
to
correct
the
error
so
that
it
does
not
happen
to
the
next
customer.
I
also
requested
return
freight
and
never
got
a
response.
I
did
get
a
RMA
quickly,
but
I
am
out
freight
money
and
did
not
get
anything
of
value!!!
I
ordered
a
Shure
SM58
mic
bundle,
which
included
a
mic
stand
and
lead.
The
cost
was
competitive
(some
firms
charged
as
much,
or
more,
for
just
the
mic
-
so
I
wouldn't
use
them).

I
couldn't
see,
on
the
web-site,
if
the
mic
included
a
mic
clip
(holder)
and
case
so
I
phoned,
and
was
told
that
they
were
both
included.
After
using
another
well
known
money
sender
and
having
nothing
but
problems
I
now
use
World
remit
and
never
had
a
single
problem
would
highly
recommend
to
any
one
sending
money
overseas.
The
full
transaction
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
was
so
smooth
and
exactly
as
they
had
promised
the
parts
showed
up.

Will
always
come
back
to
Parts

to
buy
my
online

Hey,
free
delivery
to
Australia
for
such
a
small
order.
Impressive.
A
very
useful
service
for
the
traveler.
I
especially
like
the
opportunity
to
bid
on
hotels
and
rental
cars.
We've
been
able
to
stay
in
hotels
we
otherwise
could
not
afford

because
of
Priceline.
And
it
was
with
FedEx.
I
have
used
SkyParkSecure
at
2
different
airports
now.
We
used
to
get
friends
or
family
to
take
us
to
the
airport
then
meet
us.
For
trips
of
8
days
or
less
it
is
cheaper
than
the
cost
of
the
petrol
for
the
extra
journeys
to
park
in
the
secure
Car
Parks
on
offer.
Drop
off
points
are
convenient
at
both
ends
of
the
bus

journey.
Was
hesitant
to
order
from
Country
Attire
initially,
because
the
Barbour
jacket
they
had
on
sale
was
$200
cheaper
than
in
the
US.
It
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true.
But
I'm
so
glad
I
did--I
received
my
package
in
San
Francisco
in
5
business
days!
And
the
item
is
the
real
deal.
I
purchased
a
replacement
fog
light
for
my
2004
Tahoe.
I
had
shopped
around
online
and
found
Parts
Geek
to
have
a
competitive
price,
and
a
very
manageable
website
for
both
shopping
and
ordering.
My
part
was
delivered
quickly
and
in
good
condition.
Well
packaged
and
exactly
as
displayed
on
the
website.
Reasonably
I
could
not
ask
for
more.
Thanks
Part
Geek.
I
hate
to
ask
anyone
for
anything
but
when
my
car
needed
fixing
I
didnt
have
a
choice.
My
agent
assisted
me
throughout
the
entire
process
and
was
very
understanding
of
my
situation
and
did
the
best
he
could
to
get
me
approved
as
quickly
and
easily
as
possible.
Thanks

The
contact
at
Asturias

was
somewhat
vague
about
replacement
for
the

Their
attitude
appeared
to
be
that
it
was
the
manufacturer's
fault
and
not
really
to

with

Very

company
it
seams
for
a
first
time
purchaser
I
ordered
100
flashdrives
on
a
Friday
and
had
them
in
had
by
Tuesday
the
following
week.

No
rush
order,
just
the
normal
production
time.

The
printing
looks
fantastic
and
I
couldn't
be
happier.
We
are
only
a
few
months
into
the
program
but
so
far
we
are
very
happy
with
them.

Recently
I
have
injured
my
shoulder
and
they
have
been
very
understanding
about
our
situation.

We
also
have
already
settled
on
of
the
creditors.

No
complaints
so
far.
I
did
a
lot
of
searching
online
for
loose
diamonds
and
Brilliance
was
definitely
the
easiest
site
to
navigate
and
get
the
information
I
was
looking
for.


Specifications
for
each
diamond
are
presented
well
and
it
is
easy
to
compare
diamonds
on-site.

I
am
moderately
educated
on
diamonds
and
I
found
one
that
met
all
of
the
specifications
I
was
looking
for,
but
it
seemed
a
little
underpriced.

It
was
GIA
certified
and
Brilliance
has
a
return
policy
so
I
decided
to
go
for
it.

The
diamond
shipped
quickly
to
my
local
FedEx
Office
and
I
took
it
immediately
to
a
professional
to
have
it
checked
out.

Turns
out
the
diamond
was
exactly
as
advertised,
which
means
I
got
a
great
deal.

That's
not
to
say
every
diamond
on
Brilliance
is
a
steal.

This
particular
one
was
even
cheaper
than
others
on
Brilliance
with
similar
specs,
and
I'll
probably
never
know
why
I
got
the
price
I
did.

Still,
I
did
a
lot
of
shopping
on
other
sites
and
in
person
at
jewelers
and
prices
on
Brilliance
are
certainly
competitive.

I
also
received
phone
calls
from
Brilliance
every
step
of
the
way
letting
me
know
what
was
going
on
(that
they
had
received
the
diamond
from
the
cutter,
had
shipped
the
diamond,
etc.)Combine
the
pricing
and
customer
service
with
the
great
website
and
I
would
recommend
Brilliance
to
anyone.
I
had
an
excellent
experience
with
Tahoe
Mountain
Sports.
When
I
called
to
check
on
the
status
of
my
order
due
to
needing

the
item
for
a
trip
the
lady
who
helped
me
was
super
friendly
and
my
order
arrived
quickly!
This
beats
taking
clubs
on
the
airline
in
so
many
ways.

Just
dropped
my
bag
off
at
the
shipping
store
and
they
were
ready
and
waiting
for
me
at
the
resort.

No
trying
to
drag
them
from
the
parking
lot
to
the
check-in
at
the
airport,
hoping
they
ended
up
at
the
same
airport
I
was
going
to,
no
worries
that
balls,
shoes,
or
a
wedge
"accidentally"
got
lost
and
ended
up
in
a
baggage
handler's
home,
all
for
a
price
not
much
more
than
the
airline's
fee.

Coming
back
the
resort
took
care
of
packing
and
sending,
and
the
clubs
arrived
back
home
safely.

If
it
ever
stops
snowing
in
NE
Ohio
I
might
actually
be
able
to
use
them
again!
I've
been

B
and
H

and

such

I

The
only
problem
I
had
was
finding
the
rep
from
the

My
friend
introduced
me
to
the
website
about
a
year
ago,
and

when
the
release
of
BioShock
Infinite
came
out
I
really
wanted
to
get
it.
But
I
found
it
was
expensive
at
retailers
and
on
steam.
Solution?

Even

only
had
to

a

till
a

Very
Happy!
all
contact
with
kwik
fit
employees
is
cheerful
&
helpful
&
the
actual
tyre
fit
was
great
&
fast.
The
only
downside
was
that
the
website
after
I
input
my
postcode
allowed
me
to
choose
any
date
&
time
that
was
available,
however
when
I
was
contacted
there
is
only
2
days
that
the
fitter
comes
to
my
area,
so
I
had
to
alter
my
dates,
but
other
than
that
kwik
fit
was
fast.
I'm
always
on
the
lookout
for
the
best
price
on
protein
bars
but
always
wary
of
low
priced
vendors
offering
old
stock
and
slow
processing
and
shipping.
Pothek
promptly
shipped
me
fresh
product
at
the
best
price.
I
would
have
given
them
5
stars
but
the
shipping
box
was
bigger
than
the
product
and
no
packing
was
used
to
fill
the
empty
space.

Thus
the
product
boxes
looked
a
little
battered
when
they
arrived.

This
wasn't
an
issue
as
the
protein
bars
were
intact
but
that
might
not
have
been
the
case
with
a
more
delicate
product.

Hopefully
management
will
increase
quality
control.

Either
way
I
will
purchase
from
them
again.
Fantastic
service.
Quick
and
efficient.
Good

I
was
tired
of
getting
ripped
off
from
the
local
supply
compaines,
I
stumbled
into
Healthcare
Supply.

I
was
shocked
at
the
low
prices
I
saw.
Ordering
was
very
easy.
In
two
days
my
order
was
here.

I
was
able
to
get
4
items
from
Healthcare
for
the
same
price
I
was
paying
for
1
item.
I
was
informed
of
every
step
in
the
processing
and
shipping
of
my
order.
In
the
future
I
will
check
with
Healthcare
before
buying
anything.

I'm
sure
that
I
will
place
all
my
future
orders
with
Healthcare.

If
I
could
I
would
give
you
more
than
5
stars.
In

In

fact
that
I
can
call

All

A
win-win
all
around.
Part
Geek
has
a
good
selection
of
parts
for
your
car
and
ships
quickly.

The
only
problem
I
have
is
I
ordered
an
A/C
compressor
for
my
car
along
with
the
dryer
and
orifice
tube
and
orings.

Everything
but
the
Compressor
shipped
and
now
I'm
having
difficulty
getting
it
resolved
because
you
can't
speak
to
anyone
at
PartsGeek.

Everything
is
done
through
email.

I'm
having
a
bad
feeling
about
this
because
my
packing
slip
shows
it
didn't
ship
and
they
haven't
resolved
this
issue
by
shipping
the
compressor
yet.

Instead
I
got
an
RMA
to
return
my
products
which
I
need
and
will
not
return.
I've
used
PartsGeek
twice
now
and
couldn't
be
happier.
Not
only
am
I
saving
a
lot
of
cash
buying
from
them
rather
than
retail
-
but
everything
is
laid
out
so
completely
online
that
I
don't
have
to
worry
that
I'm
buying
the
wrong
item.
The
only
thing
I
would
change
with
blackcircles
is
to
include
the
carriage
on
the
price
of
the
tyres,
not
add
it
afterwards.
Most
other
sites
offer
'free'
carriage
although
that
of
course
has
already
been
added
to
the
tyre
price.

Thank
you
Gina
for
the

service.
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
products
from
West
Coast
Shaving.

I
needed
to
exchange
a
product
and
the
staff
was
very
helpful
at
getting
me
a
refund
to

I
will
continue
to
do
business
with
a
company
that
is
definitely
customer
oriented.
The
service
is
first
class
and
they
are
very
helpful
with
the
process
and
dealing
with
any
difficulties
that
you
may
have!
I
highly
recommend

it
makes

simple

it
comes
to
selecting

need

be

performed.
Never

The
Speed
jump
rope
is
getting
beat
up
a
bit
with
some
wear
and
tear
already,
but
other
than
that
all
good
stuff.
Ever
since
I
found
out
about
Onnit
and
started
taking
their
supplements
along
with
maintaining
a
healthy
diet
and
exercise
I
have
felt
healthier,
more
energetic
and
focused.
The
concept
of
Onnit
as
being
a
human
performance
enhancer
is
an
incredible
idea
and
they
are
actually
making
it
reality.
Who
doesn't
want
to
optimize
their
body
so
that
they
can
perform
their
best?
This
was
my
third
use
of
Greenpath
in
Los

and
they
still

Despite
some
confusion
over
the
arrival
terminal,
Dean
was
there
to
greet
me
at
LAX

when
I
arrived
from
New
York.
There
was
heavy
traffic
on
the
drive
to
Hollywood,
but
good
knowledge
of
the
city
allowed
us
to
avoid
most
of
it.
I
have
bought
several
products
from
Onnit.
Only
supplements
and
food,
no
exercise
equipment.
All
of
the
products
seem
top
shelf,
and
are
wrapped
whether
the
contrary
is
true
or
not.
Can't
say
that
all
of
the
products
worked
as
well
as
promised,
but
I
can
say
there
are
some
I
feel
I
can't
live
without.
The
only
complaint
I
have
is
that
every
product
is
very
pricey.
This
made
it
so
easy
to
find
storage.
It
took
all
of
the
different
prices
and
gave
them
to
me.
All
I
did
was
compare
found
the
lowest
price
and
booked
it.
No
hassles.
Translations
are
done
fast
and
accurate.
Process
to
request
and
get
translations
is
very
simple
only
setback
is
that
after
i
rquest
a
translation
an
additional
payment
is
requested
because
it
is
not
amount
of
pages
but
amount
of
words
so
i
end
up
paying
1
or
2
additional
pages.
I
bought
2
sets
of
shimano
brakes
from
the
site,
which
I
couldn't
find
anywhere
else,
unless
I
was
willing
to
pay
double
the
price!
They
were
delivered
quickly,
and
well
packaged.
I
usually
use
CRC,
but
will
definitely
be
using
Merlin
more
often
in
the
future
:-)
This
was
a
straightforward
transaction,
from
ordering
to
paying
to
receiving
the
combination
hot
water
cylinder.

I
have
no
reservation
in
recommending
this
supplier,
based
on
the
one
purchase
I
have
made.
I
searched
the
web
for
the
cheapest
Roland
Micro
Cube
RX
Bass
amplifier,
found
it
at
Rich
Tone
Music
and
the
rest
was
as
easy
as
a
few
clicks
of
a
mouse.

The
amp
is
all
that
I
expected
and
I'm
totally
happy
with
the
transaction.
I
have
used
Showerdoc
a
number
of
times,
always
had
good
service.

The
most
recent
purchase
resulted
in
the
wrong
part
being
sent,
not
necessarily
Showerdoc's
fault.

However,
they
were
very
helpful,
sent
out
the
right
part
immediately,
paid
for
return
of
the
wrong
part
and
gave
me
a
full
refund.

You
can't
get
better
than
that.

Many
thanks
This
specialist
company
offers

I

years.

The
ordering
process
has
always
worked

and
the

have
always

I
had
booked
mobile
tyre
fitting
service
for
my
Merc.

The
technician
arrived
on
the
day
and
time
and
completed
his
job
well.

However,
inspite
of
me
explaining
the
max
tyre
pressure,
the
tyre
was
over
pressured
and
next
day
I
came
to
know
only
when
the
warning
sign
came
up.

I
had
to
immediately
rush
to
a
service
station
on
the
motorway
to
get
the
pressure
right.

This
could
have
been
avoided
if
the
technician
had
been
more
attentive
while
fitting
the
tyres.
Booking

I've

twice:
both
times
the
order
was
shipped
the

and
took
a

to

from
France
to
Canada,
which
I
consider
pretty
good
-
have
in
mind
that

I've
just
paid
around
$20
for
the
shipment
and
as
usual
it
needs
custom
review.
They
always
have
my
filters
in
stock
and
at
very
competive
prices.
Shipping
is

i
received
a
text
message,followed
later
by
a
phone
call
to
advise
me
when
the
cooker
would
be
delivered.
the
appliance
was
delivered
at
3pm.
i
was
most
impressed
by
the
service
provided,and
would
recommend
your
company
to
family
and
friends/
nigel
tribe
Very
pleased
with
how
the
order
was
processed
and
shipped.

The
email
i
received
to
arrange
delivery
was
very
useful,
however
once
i
made
a
change
to
the
delivery
date
from
two
available
dates,
i
couldn't
swap
this
date
to
the
other
option
as
the
courier
website
wouldn't
allow
me
to.
I
have
been
tempted
to
try
out
some
continental
tyres
for
my
Audi
A3
and
Black
Circles
competitive
prices
for
the
Contact
Sport
3's
that
i
was
after.

After
placing
my
order,
i
recieved
a
phone
call
to
query
whether
i
was
aware
that
i'd
picked
the
MO
(Mercedes)
version
of
the
tyre
which
in
this
instance
i
didn't
and
it
doesn't
effect
the
performance
or
as
they
are
effectively
the
same
as
the
standard
or
Audi
labelled
version
of
the
CS3's
but
are
a
little
cheaper
and
were
in
stock.

That
level
of
attention
to
detail
was
appreciated
and
i
learnt
something
that
day,
although
it
didn't
change
my
order
it
was
useful
to
be
informed.
Fast
shipping
but
terrible
when
you
need
customer
service.

It
would
be
nice
and
more
efficient
if
their
reps
take
the
time
to
read
each
request
more
carefully.

Took
me
like
five
different
request
just
to
get
an
order
confirmation.

Request
a
RMA
was
painfully
similar.

William
was
excellent
to
deal
with.
He
matched
a
lower
internet
price
and
walked
me
through
the
various
tire
options
for
my
car.
He
was
courteous
and
professional
during
the
entire
buying
experience.
Will
recommend
to
friends.
Sold
my
car
and
the
customer
service
Representative
even
took
the
time
to
drive
me
back
to
my
home.
I
worked
in
customer
service
for
many
years
and
this
experience
showed
me
that
there
is
still
good
customer
service.
I
tried
the
new
2014
internet
security
and
was
very
surprised
at
all
of
the
features
it
offered.
I
usually
compare
and
try
other
beta
securities
and
this
Bitdefender

was
the
best
of
the
lot
for
2014.
This
was
my
second
order
from
iCanvasArt.

Both
times,
the
ordering
process
was
easy
and
the
orders
arrived
on
time
with
no
issues.
Good
costumer
service,
great
stock
of
products,
fast
delivery
and
rational
pricing.
What
else
could
you
ask
for?
It
took
two
trys
as,
at
first,
they
sent
the
wrong
part.

This
was
quickly
corrected
however
with
both
courtesy
and
alacrity.

I
would
order
again
from

10
years

when

&
found
them
33%
cheaper

got

Great
service

very

I
wanted
to
do
my
honeymoon
in

I
found

the

helped
me
to
get
the
best
prices
for
hotels
as
well
as
the
availability
in
easy
way
and
we
plan
to
make
it

So
far
so
good.

No

If

The
website
was
easy
to
use
and
ordering
online
was
straightforward,
which
was
a
relief.
The
item
I
ordered
was
not
easily
available
elsewhere,
so
not
easy
to
do
a
price
comparison
but
it
seemed
reasonable.
Most
impressive
was
the
fact
that
although
it
was
late
afternoon/
early
evening
when
I
ordered
the
items
were
delivered
the
following
lunchtime.
Well
done!
I
ordered
the

There
must
be
some
secret
code
that
as
a
shaving
brush
purchaser
I
am
not
aware
of
about
the
content
of
the
bristles.

I
purchased
a
brush
for
when
I
am
home
(I
work
out
of
town).

I
have
had
an
Art
of
Shaving
"Fine
Badger"
brush
for
about
2
years.

This
is
the
middle
of
their
three
brushes,
$110
currently.

Very
satisfactory.

I
thought
possibly
an
online
outfit
might
have
better
prices,
and
it
might
be
nice
to
get
a
Silver
Tip
Boar
Bristle
brush
-
something
even
softer
than
the
one
I
had.

I
purchased
a
Parker
BHST
Silver
Tip
brush
from
West
Coast
Shaving.

I
find
it
much
stiffer
than
the
Art
of
Shaving
brush.

I
assume
this
is
not
a
100%
Silver
Tip
brush,
that
there
must
be
some
nylon
bristles
in
it,
and
maybe
there
is
some
wording
in
the
description
that
should
have
tipped
me
off.

It
was
less
expensive,
so
I
guess
its
"you
get
what
you
pay
for"
and
that
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
an
on
line
supplier
has
better
prices.

The
brush
is
probably
comparable
to
the
Art
of
Shaving's
low
end
brush
(though
a
little
more
expensive),
but
I
am
disappointed
that
it
was
merchandised
as
a
high
end
brush,
Silver
Tip
(the
softest
boar
bristles).

Purchasing
a
shaving
brush
without
being
able
to
feel
it
is
apparently
a
risky
proposition.
I
would
highly
recommend
this
company.
High
quality
products.
Fast
shipping.
And
excellent
customer
service.
Quick
E-Mail
reply.
Very
knowledgeable
in
products

sell.
Delivered
and
recommended
the
exact
part
I
needed
to
fix
my
espresso
machine.
My
machine
works
like
the
day
I
bought
it.
Instead
of
throwing
away
my
$300.00
espresso
machine
I
was
recommended
a
$50.00
pump.
My
husband
installed
it
and
its
now
working
like
a
charm.
Thank
you
so
much.
I
am
now
back
to
making
my
favorite
drinks
without
having
to
pay
over
$6.00
a
beverage.
You
guys
really
know
your
business.
Can't
say
enough
about
the
wonderful
service.
Thank
You
so
much.

Good
easy
ording,
very
fast
delivery.
Was
disappointed
about
the
1st
order
having
to
be
delivered
at
the
card
address,
but
all
worked
out
ok,
it
gets
delivered
to
our
local
post
office
for
collection.
Sure,
I
check
out
the
other
sites
before
I
buy,
but
I
always
return
to
B&H
to
make
the
actual
purchase.

Their
prices
are
competitive,
the
shipping
is
usually
free,
and
tax
free
too
since
they
don't
have
a
store
where
I
live.

The
tax
savings
alone
usually
beats
Amazon
prices.
My
purchase
of
the
Blackrapid
"shot"
strap
was
my
second
strap
from
them.
The
other
being
the
"sport".
I
used
the
"sport
"
primarily
in
the
winter
for
shooting
birds
with
a
100-400mm
lens.
In
spring
I
switch
my
focus
to
butterfly
photography.
The
"shot"
is
more
useful
to
me
for
this.
I
am
frequently
taking
the
strap
off
of
my
shoulder

to
get
down
eye
level
with
butterflies.
The
use
of
the
tripod
screw
mount
is
much
more
secure
than
the
sharp
edged
canon
mounting
points
for
their
factory
strap.
I
have
worn
out
both
canon
straps
and
two
U-Strap
straps,
even
one
with
kevlar.
The
rubber
shoulder
area
feels
very
secure
on
the
"shot"
I
would
certainly
recommend
this
strap.
B&H
is
my
sole
supplier
of
photo/camera
needs.

They
always
delivery
on
time
from
an
incredibly
large
selection.

I
always
use
the
chat
feature
to
make
certain
I
order
the
correct
items.

I
couldn't
ask
for
a
better
photography
supplier.
Great
service,
Great
product.
Thank
you
so
much
for

printing
off
my
tees.
I
really
was
surprised
when
the
company
called
me
to
see
if
I
could
send
them
a
better
pic
so
that
the
image
would
show
correct
on
my
tee,
that
was
excellent
customer
service.
Thanks
again
guys!!!
they
always
have
the
best
deals
and
rates
on
products!
also
usually
have
great
freebies
and
their
customer
service
is
awesome.

I
accidentally
ordered
my
supplies
and
shipped
them
to
the
wrong
address
and
they
changed
the
address
for
me
for
my
new
location
and
it
wasn't
a
problem
at
all.

I
came

I

I
had

So
I
did
and
there

If

in

I
won't
bother

I
will
go
straight
to
them.
I
enjoy

with

They
understand
the
importance
of
customer

and
do
well
to

quickly.

I
am
pleased
with
the
results,

them
to
anyone

late
for

Have
been
using
this
co.
since
2008,
mainly
because
the
Frixon
pens
we
order
for
our
co.
use
are
the
best
price
we
can
find
on
the
Internet,
plus
they
do
refills
which
is
even
a
cheaper
option
for
us.
PLUS
if
you
spend
over
a
certain
limit,
you
might
even
get
a
freebie
sometimes!!
Delivery
is
always
quick
after
the
order
has
been
placed.
Highly
recommend
them.
Excellent

It
was
easy
to
book
the
reservation,
but
we
weren't
certain
where
to
park
at
first.

The
hotel
clerk
gave
us
grief
because
we
didn't
have
a
paper
record
of
the
reservation.


I
showed
him
the
confirmation
email
and
told
him
the
whole
point
of
booking
online
was
to
be
paperless
and
that
in
today's
age,
more
and
more
people
are
abandoning
the
hassle
of
keeping
printers
at
home.

While
belittling
us
and
lecturing
about
how
the
hotel
doesn't
get
reimbursed
without
a
paper
form,
he
claimed
to
be
such
a
nice
guy
for
letting
us
park
there
and
that
other
clerks
would
make
us
pay
twice.

(What
a
bunch
of
jerks
that
hotel
must
hire.)

I
was
worried
when
the
ticket
he
gave
me
wouldn't
let
us
out
at
the
unattended
gate
after
our
trip,
but
after
four
or
five
tries,
the
machine
finally
accepted
it.
Got
it
fast,
as
ordered.
Parts

I
am
glad
I
ordered
this
book
more
than
20
days
before
the
class
started
because
I
still
have
not
received
my
book
yet.
I
have
used
bookbyte
in
the
past
and
have
had
no
issues
with
getting
books
on
time
but
my
book
when
I
tracked
it
is
in
the
same
location
that
it
started
in.
class
starts
next
week
and
still
no
book.
So
I
am
keeping
my
fingers
crossed
that
it
gets
here
in
time.
Also
I
decided
to
rent
this
book
and
it
has
already
started
counting
down
days
until
it
needs
to
be
returned.
I
think
that
the
time
should
not
start
until
I
receive
the
book.
If
I
would
of
only
done
the
90
day
rental
it
would
be
over
due
by
the
time
it
got
back
to
bookbyte.
I
think
this
is
unsatisfactory
and
hope
the
book
comes
soon
or
I
will
not
be
using
this
company
again.
PRETTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
GOOD
I
picked
GAK
for
my
online
order,
as
I
had
previously
had
a
good
experience
in
their
store,
and
they
were
helpful
on
the
phone
with
a
couple
of
questions
before
I
purchased.
Extremely
satisfied
with
CJS
so
far.
This
isn't
my
first
order,
and
each
one
so
far
went
smoothly.
I
will
definitely
continue
to
use
CJS
for
my
gaming
keys
since
I
trust
I
won't
be
disappointed
with
them.
This
is
not
the
first
time
I
have
ordered
from
B&H.

The
service
is
excellant
and
the
products
are
just
as
described.

I
would
recommend
B&H
to
any
photo
enthusiast
My
mother
always
says:
"if
something
is
too
good
to
be
true
it
probably
is"
so,
with
that
advice
ringing
in
my
ear
and
with
trepidation,
I
purchased
some
cheap
Ray
Ban
glasses
with
a
prescription.
I
ordered
what
I
thought
were
bib
shorts
that
turned
out
to
be
just
shorts.
This
made
for
a
disappointing
Christmas
morning
for
my
wife.
I
ordered
2
identical
ankle
supports,
which
by
the
way
are
great
for
my
needs,

unfortunately
only
1
arrived
in
a
massive
box.
After
a
phone
call
to
a
very
efficient
young
lady
the
second
one
arrived
3
days
later,
again
in
a
massive
box
which
looked
like
it
had
been
run
over.
Excellent
service
and
customer
relations.
Make
an
order
in
the
morning
and
9
times
out
of
10
its
on
your
doorstep
the
next
day;
and
that's
just
on
standard
delivery.
I
often
wonder
what
would
happen
if
I
paid
for
1st
class
delivery...
Make
the
order
then
go
and
look
out
the
window
???.
The
Alamo
counter
at
LAX
was
difficult
to
understand
and
they
did
not
provide
many
options.
It
felt
more
like
a
pressure
sales
job.
I
doubt
if
I
would
use
Alamo
again.
Pros:
Excellent
service,
big

of
products,
good

I
was
very
happy
with
the
spped
of

and
with
the
products.

came
across
Cash4Books
through
a
web
search
and
found
their
buy

to
be
either
just
as
good
or
even
better
than
other
competitors.
I
went
with
them
and

on

immediately.
I
sent

my

and
received

within
the

I
was
in

market
for
some

gifts

provided

I

within
days
after
I
ordered
them
and

I've
found
the

be
extremely
useful.

(with

.

I

I
can

so
many
times
that

it

something
about

they
KILL
the

and
you
have
to

over.
After

time,
I
was
getting
a
little
frustrated.
But
I
was
finally

After

week
I
called
to
see
if
my

had

it

but
no

to
let
me

They
REALLY
need

so
if

problem
you
can
just

or

and
I
can
report
I
bought
a
header
panel
for
my
jeep
through
partsgeek
and
the
shipping
was
25
dollars
and
it
took
a
week
and
a
half
to
get
to
me
and
I
bought
parts
from
another

they

and
I
got
my
parts
in
three
business
days
and
they
were
both
shipped
from
the
same
distance
away
from
me.

So
I
will
never
us

again
simply
because
they
charge
a
ton
for
shipping
and
it
takes
a
long
time
to
get
to

the
only
good
thing
is
the
price
of
their
products.
I
was

I
got

I

I

in

My

in

and
he
wanted

So
he

when

right
in

made
it

The
process
for
arranging
the
carhire
via
ArgusCarHire.com
was
very
efective
and
was
backed
up
with
further
communications
from
them.
The
car
was
a

Titan,
very
clean
and
we
were
transferred
from
the
airport
to
the
pick
up
location
very
efficiently.
However
it
turned
out
that
AVIS
were
dealing
on
dehlaf
of
Budget
and
we
were
given
the
option
of
paying
the
excess
waver
charge
or
returning
the
car
to
their
garage
for
a
"damage
check"
prior
to
dropping
it
off
at

I
got

for

what
I
would

No

with
the
experience.
I
paid
for
the
"pre-order"
option
because
their
website
said
my
cell
phone/provider
was
"coming
soon".
I
needed
the
unlock
for
a
vacation
2
months
later,
so
I
thought
there
was
definitely
enough
time.
After
4
weeks
of
no
updates,
I
started
emailing
them
every
week.
They
kept
saying
it
would
happen
ASAP...

Well,
it
took
more
than
4
months!

Great
service
The

great

the

I
was
emailed

decided
to
purchase
a

The

was
easy
to
use
for

Emails
were
sent
with
all
the

when
the

The

I
bought
included
a

was
a
bonus.
Good

a

The

the

I

Excellent

I'm
still
deciding
on

Not

Can't
remember
how
long
it
took
to
fill
the
order
just
before
this
last
one----but
I
do
know
that
it
was
very
quick--and
this
last
order,
if
you
can
believe
it
was
even
quicker--I
think
I
had
my
order
TWO
DAYS
after
I
ordered
it
on

they
have
a
warehouse
out
here
for
us
West

Petflow
for
such
GREAT
service!!
the
item
i
purchased
was

much
better
than
all
other

i
found.

Simple
decision.

It

timely
and
without

Really
Pleased
With
Heinnie
Haynes
Service
Every
Christmas,
for
the
past
four
years,
I
solve
the,
"what
do
I
give
my
grandchildren?"
question
by
getting
them
their
own
Visa
card.

Every
year
I
put
a
new
photo
of
them
on
the
card
(partly
so
merchants
have
a
"photo
ID"
of
who
is
using
the
card),
and
every
year
they
tell
me
it's
the
one
gift
they
really
look
forward
to.

It's
safer
than
cash
and
they
feel
more
grown
up
using
it.
These
people
are
simply
top
shelf,
first
class.
Professional
and
kind
staff
that
takes
the
time
to
follow
up,
"personally"
to
ensure
your
complete
satisfaction.
What
can
i
say,the
delivery
was
very
fast,and
a
very
good
price,and
i
did
some
looking
around.
Nice.
Keep
up
the
good
work.
Always
helpful,
professional,
and
they
know
their
stuff!
PureFormulas
is
fast,
and
easy
to
order
from.
No
hassles,
no
shipping
charges,
and
my
order
arrives
in
a
few
days.
What
more
can
you
ask?
The
person
that
answered
my
service
problem
was
extremely
helpful
&
pleasant
to
deal
with.
What
the
problem
was
is
that
the
service
person
was
not
informed
that
there
was
a
rollout
of
a
upgrade
12.1.
This
opinion
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
service
person
but
with
the
rollout
department.

Which
was
to
me
unbelievable
from
management
&
IT.
Stamps
as
done
an
excellent
job
for
us
for
a
number
of
years.
We
will
continue
to
use
Stamps
but
I
do
know
that
1
bad
experience
can
cause
a
lot
of
pain.
I
hope
it
wakes
up
the
IT
department,
we
are
the
customer
&
we
pay
the
bills.
Ok
you
can
get
the
same
bargains
on
e-bay
but
not
with
the
same
peace
of
mind
by
shopping
at
3000rpm.
These
guys
are
really
good
-
never
had
a
problem!
Parts
arrived
quickly
and
installed
in
minutes.
Exact
fit
good
quality
Experienced
delays
in
delivery
of
order
4
times
now.

I
call
regarding
the
delay.

Then
they
get
the
order
together.

This
last
time,
I
had
to
contact
them
a
second
time
before
they
put
the
order
together
and
shipped
it
out.

If
there
is
the
slightest
issue
with
an
order,
expect
it
to
be
delayed
and
no
internal
process
for
following
up
on
it.

The
first
two
times,
they
gave
me
a
10%
discount,
the
next
two
times,
just
an
apology.

I'm
done
with
them.
I
used
the
Whiskey
Exchange
many
moons
ago,
and
on
this
ossassion
I
wanted
a
particular
item
which
has
only
been
available
in
the
USA.
I
checked
the
Exchange
website
and
behold
there
it
was
and
at
a
very,
very
competitive
price.
I
had
no
hesitation
and
ordered
two
bottles.
which
arrived
when
they
said
it
would
and
I
am
now
enjoying
my
purchase
with
my
friends.
The
process
was
easy
and
I
will
use
the
site
again...
Good
price,
came
on
time
I
have
never
had
any
issues
with
B&H.
I
get
everything
I
order
in
a
timely
manner
and
my
order
is
always
correct.
Couldn't
be
happier
with
this
professional
company.
they
are
fast,
and
have
fair
prices
My
first
purchase
through
Parts
Geek.
I
have
to
say
everything
went
perfect!
The
price
was
right.
The
product
was
as
described
accurately
and
was
delivered
in
great
time.
Will
definitely
recommend
to
my
colleagues.
B&H
always
has
the
gear
you
need
to
complete
your
creative
project
with
efficiency
and
up
most
professionalism.
the
order
was
processed
and
shipped
in
a
matter
of
days.
The
product
is
amazing.
I've
called
about
a
different
part
and
received
good,
helpful
info.
Will
definitely
be
ordering
from
these
guys
again.
Best
price
on
the
web.
I
have
purchased
from

them
before
and
will
again.
They
used
to
be
good
do
not
know
what
happened
to
I
will
definitely
do
business
with
Parts
Geek
in
the
future
for
all
my
needs.

The
service
is
quick,
dependable
and
the
products
are
high
quality.

I
have
absolutely
no
negatives
toward
this
company.
My
order
was
immediately
processed
and
shipped.
One
of
the
shippers,
UPS,
could
not
tell
difference
between
4
and
6
on
house
number
and
subsequently
delivered
to
wrong
address.
The
second
shipper,
FEDEX,
was
great
-
delivered
package
one
day
earlier
than
scheduled.
Good
prices
and
prompt
service.If
you
want
a
good
deal
on
a
tow-bar
use
these
people.
they
did
a
very
great
job
I
was
in
and
out
in
no
time
I
am
so
glad
there
is
a
TFT
in
my
"
neighborhood".
I
need
tires.
They
have
them.
Nuff
said.
It's
what
they
do...TIRES.
Just
clean
the
restroom
for
the
ladies
next
time.
Prices
are
great
-
great
selection
-
great
staff!
Easy
to
order
and
confidence
in
who
you
are
buying
from!
I
would
recommend
trying
this
company
anytime
you
want
to
book
car
hire.
Easy
and
a
good
price
especially
for
a
site
on
the
airport.
My
orders
are
so
fast
I
don't
have
time
to
make
room
for
the
equipment
I
order.
Placed
my
order
on
a
fri/sat.
Didn't
get
processed
until
the
following
Tuesday?
There
has
not
been
a
lag
like
this
in
the
past.
Would
have
expected
drugs
to
be
here
by
the
following
Friday,
which
has
become
the
expectation.
You
guys
set
the
bar
too
high
it
seems.
Still
waiting
in
drugs.
Projected
to
arrive
27th.
Kinda
weak.
A
little
let
down.
Very
knowleledable
staff
and
reasonable
prices.
Usually
ships
same
day.
I
am
a
loyal
patron
and
will
be
for
years
to
come.
I
put
in
on
the
car
I
drive
now.
Let's
see.
Good
company
.
I
would
like
it
more
if
they
would
have

some
type
notification
if
part
is
backorded.
Awesome
place
to
get
quality
items
for
a
good
price
and
fast
shipping.
Also
very
good
and
helpful
customer
service.
I've
tried
many
supplements
from
onnit
and
everything
has
been
so
beneficial
to
my
body.

Whether
it's
new
mood
for
those
days
I'm
feeling
blue
to
alpha
brain
to
help
me
think
clearly
and
logical
at
work.
I
recommend
onnit
products
for
anyone
looking
to
optimize
their
body,
mind
and
wellness.
Thank
you
onnit.

Well,
I
appreciated
that

thank
you.
Here
is
the
issue
in
a
nutshell
I
ordered
5
items,
which
were
showing
as
IN
STOCK
ready
for
immediate
dispatch.
I
cannot
recommend
isupplyenergy
at
all.
In
fact
I
would
advise
anyone
expecting
fairness,
clarity,
professionalism,
efficiency
and
honesty
to
AVOID
this
company
at
all
costs!
My
first
purchase
from
WhyBuyNew
and
I
will
definitely
won't
be
my
last!
Reliable
and
fast
as
always
+
competitive
prices!
DV
have
always
delivered
and
never
let
me
down
or
disappointed.
I
highly
recommend
DV
to
everyone.

"They

Order
a
new
radiator
and
it
was
the
exact
part.
I
got
free
shipping
and
I
received
the
part
in
only
three
days
and
it
was
well
packaged.
I'll
be
buying
my
parts
from
Partsgeek.com
from
here
on
out.
FramesDirect.com
had
a
wide
variety
of
sunglasses
to
chose
from.
I
would
recommend
that
you
go
to
the
mall
and
try
on
glasses
to
get
a
feel
for
what
style
and
size
fits
you
best.
Write
down
the
model
number
and
size
of
glasses
and
go
to
FramesDirect.com
and
order
your
new
glasses.
Shipping
time
was

what
i
expected
5
to
7
business
days.
With
FREE
shipping,
who
can
complain.
The
sunglasses
I
purchased
was
what
was
sent.
I
would
definitely
order
from
this
company
again.
Excellent
service,and
excellent

5
STARS!
Many
of
the
floral
arrangements
at
my
grandsons'
funeral
were
from
Ava's
and
every
one
was
fabulous.

All
were
delivered
on
time,
and
on
a
SUNDAY!

Some
of
the
other
locals
florists
wouldn't
do
that.

The
online
ordering
process
was
a
breeze
and
we
appreciated
the
e-mail
updates
confirming
delivery,
etc.
Delivery
was
FREE
and
we
received
45%
off
our
order,
making
it
possible
to
fit
into
even
the
tightest
budget.

Thanks
again.
The
object
was
according
to
the
description
and
the
delivery
was
within
a
week
when
i
order
my
air
to
Sweden.
I
found
this
company
online
and
have
placed
a
few
orders
and
have
no
complaints.

They
are
on
my
short
list
for
ordering
wheelchair
supplies.
What
is
there
to
say?
The
site
works
well,
the
shipping
is
great.
Everything
always
packed
well
and
they
do
not
kill
me
with
spam.

Satisfied
with
the
Company.
Disappointed
with
the
delivery
service.
USPS
delivered
the
product
but
I
never
received
it.
Awesome!
The
BEEs
arrived
today
at
7:30
am,
they
were
a
little
late,
their
syrup
can
was

completely
empty
(need
an
extra
shot
of
syrup).
I
knew
this
was
not
due
to
Pigeon
Mountain
service,
so
I
checked
the
bees
for
health.
They
were
good
and
the
queen
was
in
good
condition.
The
amount
of
dead
bees
was
below
the
limit,
all
in
all
a
good
package.
They
are
now
in
their
hive
and
being
monitored
closely.
I
placed
my
order
online
an
received
my
order
as
promised.
I
had
some
technical
issues
but
the
care@superdry
team
were
prompt
and
very
efficient
in
trying
to
resolve
them.
B&H
is
a
quality
company.
Honest
as
the
day
is
long.
Great
service
and
even
better
prices.
Never
received
my
order!
Contact
them
twice,
first
time
I
received
the
lamest
excuses.....2nd
time
they
just
stopped
responding!
Easy
to
buy
don't
know
about
delivery
yet.
B&H
has
everything
the
pro
photographer,
videographer
and
recording
engineer
needs
to
build
their
business!
The
Explora
section
of
the
site
has
buying
guides,
suggestions
professional
reviews

and

as
well.
There
is
a
wealth
of
insight
available
in
addition
to
the
great
selection
of

Super
fast
shipping!
Great
prices.
I
have
used
Transferwise
since
it
was
first
reviewed
on
the
BBC
website.
They
have
always
given
me
an
excellent
and
rapid
service,
which
can
be
said
of
very
few
companies
these
days.
Long
may
they
continue
to
be
successful.
I
had
the
worst
booking
experience
I
have
ever
had
with
a

hotel.

It
was
very
hard
to
understand
the
agent
I
worked
with.

I
could
have
dealt
with
that
though.

I
wanted
to
book
2
rooms
for
2
nights
at
a
Comfort
Inn
in
Troy
,
Wisc.

I
asked
and
was
told
4
times
that
this
hotel
was
in
Troy,Wisc.

After
the
booking
I
didn't
feel
right
so
I
called
the
number
that
the
agent
gave
me
for
the
hotel
only
to
find
out
it
was
over
90
minutes
away
from
where
I
wanted
to
stay.

Then
I
was
told
my
credit
card
had
been
charged
by
Expedia
and
I
would
have
to
go
to
them
to
get
my
money
back.

I
then
called
your
service
again
and
got
a
lady
that
said
she
caught
the
charge
and
the
card
would
not
be
charged.

Sunday
my
card
WAS
charged
and
I
was
told
it
would
that
4
to
7
days
before
it
would
be
made
right.

I
now
have
about
$400
tied
up
and
had
to
book
another
hotel
closer
to
Troy.

So
I
was
lied
to
twice
by
your
company
and
do
not
have
many
good
things
to
say
about
you.

I'm
not
sure
I
will
ever
use
you
again
The
watch
is
exactly
as
appears
in
photo.

Excellent
condition
and
good
value.


I
will
definitely
work
with
this
seller
again.
I
had
never
used
Easytobook
before
and
after
ten
minutes
it
was
obvious
that
it
was
easy
to
use
and
more
importantly
it
seemed
to
offer
lower
prices
for
practically
every
hotel
I
looked
at.
So
easy
and
quick
to
do.
No
more
hassle

Great
prices,
worth
the
wait
for
shopping.
Not
a
fan
of
the
procedure
you
go
through
when
needing
to
talk
to
a
rep.
My
experience
with
Town
Fair
Tire
could
not
have
been
any
better.

The
technicians
were
courteous
and
answered
all
my
questions
cheerfully.

But
best
of
all,
by
taking
advantage
of
their
price
match
guarantee,
I
saved
almost
$25
per
tire
by
finding
a
website
that
had
the
same
tire
I
was
planning
to
buy
at
a
lower
price
(by
over
$20
per
tire).

The
procedure
I
had
to
use
to
get
the
lower
price
was
relatively
simple
and
I
was
able
to
complete
it
online
and
get
confirmation
the
next
day.

So
when
I
went
in
to
get
the
tires
mounted
I
had
already
locked
in
the
lower
price.
I
had
to
return
a
part,
had
a
car
Tranny
blow
on
me.
I
get
a
RMA
#
quickly,
am
now
returning
for
a
refund.
Fast
service.

Thanks.

most
certainly

Very

impressed.
I
have
bought
audio
and
video
recordings
from
many
sources
during
my
lifetime
and
watch
Companies
Like
Tower
Records,
The
Were
house
and
Unique
Records
ect
price
themselves
out
of
the
market.
Your
prices
are
the
best
that
I
know
about
at
this
time.
Keep
up
the
good
practice
and
your
customer
service
is
great.
A
great
service
provided
,
passing
all
the
main
attractions.
Great
commentary
,
both
automated
and
live.
I
would
recommend
These
folks
to
anyone.
Their
gear
is
competitively
priced
and
their
customer
service
is
UTTERLY
peerless
-
they
are
fantastic
people
who
will
go
the
extra
mile.
I
have
spent
way
too
much
with
them
over
the
years
-
and
I
don't
regret
a
single
purchase!!
We
purchased
a
hammered
bronze
fire
table.
It
was
a
little
scary
buying
the
unit
on
line,
but
a
representative
of
Starfire
talked
us
through
the
process,
answered
our
questions
and
assured
us
that
the
product
would
more
than
meet
our
expectations.
It
did.
When
it
arrived,
a
foot
for
one
of
the
legs
was
missing.
Directions
said
to
contact
a
number
if
anything
was
missing
or
broken.
I
did,
somewhat
skeptically.
A
voice
said,
"I
can
help
you
with
that."
The
part
arrived
in
the
mail
a
short
time
later.
We're
delighted
with
the
firetable
and
with
the
help
we
received
from
the
Company.
Good,
easy
to
use

used
this

to
buy

Always

Merlin
is
no.1
on
my
list
before
I
check
out
any
other
shops.
Not
many
can
campare.
Delivery
is
superb
and
parts
are
always
at
a
good
price.
Originally
purchased
one
for
a
new
Evouqe
and
so
impressed
with
the
great
fit
and
ease
!
Then
purchased
one
for
a
Vogue
and
no
where
near
the
same
excellent
fit
!
Lots
of
DIY
sticky
Velcro
(
just
one
Way
)
so
dissimilar
to
the
Evoque

!
Flapping
around
on
the
back
will
look
for
an
alternative
a
disappointment
compared
to
the
first
and
no
reason
either
!
Why
drop
your
standards
?
Have
bought
from
this
this
most
competent
site
on
a
few
occasions,
and
have
received
great
advice
when
telephoned
and
emailed
!
Excellent
company
will
use
again
and
again
!

The

Great

Got

cost
as

as
my

to

Nothing
like
wasting
money
I
was
looking
for
a
new
pair
of
walking
poles
and
I
notice
that
The
Outdoor
Shop
had
very
competitive
prices
for
the
pair
I
wanted.
I
placed
the
order
with
NiceCans

without
any
prior
knowledge
and
have
to
admit
that
I
was
a
little
uncertain
about
it.
I
am
85
years
old
and
my
daughter
gave
me
a
#3
fairway
wood
for
Christmas
last
year
and
I
love
it
and
I
brought
a
driver
to
match
the
#3
wood.
i
will
continue
to
shop
here
if
the
price
is
right...and
it
looks
like
they
do
have
good
prices
on
their
products.
Great
product.
My
truck
handles
much
better.
Ordered
Sunday.
Arrived
Tuesday.
Free
p&p
so
well
impressed.
Also
cheapest
around
for
the
product
I
purchased.
Love
the
site,
best
prices
on
all
products.

Shipping
is
a
little
high
though,
comes
within
a
week.
Superb
Service
!
When
an
item
was
received
broken,
a
short
phone
call
to
a
very
helpful
and
courteous
operator,
resulted
ion
a
replacement
arriving
satisfactorily
next
day.
I
like
the
idea
that
they
sell
not
only
regular
dated
products,
but
also
those
which
have
passed
their
"best
by"
date.
I
use
them
all
the
time
and
i
know
that
they
are
just
as
good
AND
i
get
a
better
price.
Thanks

Speedy

Liked
the
security
phone
call,
to
add
certainty
to
my
order
As
I
was
looking
for
places
to
stay
in
Ireland,
I
found
the
Hostelworld
now
web
site.
The
place
selection
was
organized
well
so
that
it
was
easy
to
find
a
hostel
that
was
in
the
right
location
for
the
right
price.

The
site
presentation
was
helpful
and
informative.
I
have
to
say,
this
is
one
of
the
fast
internet
company's
around,
with
a
full
arrange
of
product's
to
please
anyone
and
personally
the
prices
are
hard
to
beat
as
well
No
complaints,
very
happy
with
the
service
The
price
is
always
competetive
and
due
to
bulk
buying
often
cheaper
than
the
original
quote,
there
aren't
many
companies
that
do
that
in
this
cut
throat
world
of
today.
I
used
to
get
my
protien
from
GNC
.Didn't

realize
how
much
I
was
getting
robbed
until
I
seen
your
prices
!
Your
half
the
price
of
GNC
and
same
quality
!
I
can''t
say
anything
bad
about
your
company
I've
always
been
more
than
satified
with
my
puchases
!
The
company's
interface
was
easy
to
use
and
I
was
able
to
create
a
great
design
with
their
templates.

The
correspondence
with
the
sales
rep
when
i
was
ready
to
place
my
order
was
concise
and
prompt,
despite
the
language
barrier.

And
to
that
end,
the
only
reservation
I
have
about
the
company
that
was
in
China
was
that
the
product
was
order
in
the
end
of
Sept.,
and
it
arrived
a
month
later.

This
only
makes
sense,
since
I
ordered
only
one
product
and
they
had
to
print
and
then
ship
to
the
States.

So
just
leave
yourself
plenty
of
time
to
design
and
order
your
product.

I
give
them
a
lot
of
credit
for
printing
individual
orders,
but
best
yet,
is
that
they
keep
the
design,
so
next
time
I
order,
my
design
is
all
ready
for
me!

Overall,
I've
been
pretty
impressed.
I
have
placed
a
few
orders
during
the
past
year.
So
far,
I
have
received
everything
just
as
ordered.
Ordering
was
easy
and
fast
I
like
things
simple
and
you
guys
are
all
that.

Great
prices
to
you
beat
everyone
on
the
net.

I
placed
my
order
on
at
the
first
of
the
week
and
it
was
here
by
that
Friday.
Web
site
logically
organized
and
easy
to
navigate,
particularly
useful
in
drilling
down
for
detailed
product
information.
I'm
very
pleased
with
the
service
partsgeek
provided.
How
ever
the
Haynes
book
i
purchased
doesn't
cover
everything
I
needed
for
the
fuel
system
on
my
van.
There
is
information
left
out.
From
the
original
design
concept
to
the
finished
product
the
crew
at
Flashbay
were
very
obliging
and
had
excellent
concepts
and
thus
we
received
a
product
that
we
are
absolutely
delighted
with,
we
look
the
part
and
we
would
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
the
Flashbay
team
to
anyone.
The
reservation
was
not
complete...I
reserved
a
non-smoking
room,
but
the
reservation
was
not
transmitted
to
the

correctly.
I
have

after

Some
of

on
the

and
a
good
service
too.
When
I
did
have
a
problem
getting
a
key,
it
was
quickly
resolved.
Hands

Will

taunton

ive
used
the
high

store
an
now
the
online
website
both
10/10
for

I
bought
an
a/c
hose
and
drier
from
partsgeek.com
at
a
very
good
price.

But
after
they
said
my
order
was
shipped,
I
got
a
mystery
credit
from
partsgeek.com
that
I
had
no
idea
what
it
was
for
until
the
hose
didn't
arrive.

Then
the
credit
was
only
for
the
amount
of
the
hose
and
didn't
include
the
shipping
charges.

It
took
an
unpleasant
exchange
of
emails
to
sort
out
what
did
and
didn't
get
shipped
before
they
agreed
to
refund
my
shipping
charges.
Excellent
service,
my
order
arrived
remarkably
quickly.
The
postage
was
pricey
though.
I
purchased
a
4
gang
Victorian
light
switch
from
The
Internet
Electrical
Store.
It
is
a
beautiful
quality
item,
priced
reasonably,
and
it
arrived
very
quickly.
Excellent
service.
Thank
you
!
Very
good
service.
Good
Service
and
very
competitive
quotes.
Not
much
i
can
add
than
perfect.
Good
price,
straightforward
purchase,
FAST
delivery.
You
can't
go
wrong.
I
enjoyed
my
experience
with
Affordable
buttons.
They
were
very
friendly,
helpful
and
professional.

The
only
advice
I
would
give
them
is
when
speaking
with
a
customer
is
to
recommend
going
to
the
color
guide
they
have
on
their
website.
This
happened
after
my
third
phone
call
after
two
proofs.
If
I
was
guided
to
the
color
guide
to
start
with,
it
could
have
saved
some
time
for
everyone.
Also,
they
should
review
the
color
guide
and
the
names
they
give
to
some
of
the
colors.
There
is
some
adjusting
of
the
names
that
could
be
considered.
That
way
the
colors
would
be
a
closer
representation
of
the
name
of
the
color.
This
is
just
friendly
advice.
Overall,
a
good
experience
with
friendly
representatives
and
a
good
finished
product.
Thank
you.
We
just
love
this
cabinet.

It
allows
a
60"
flat
screen
to
fit
inside.

It
works
perfectly,
and,
the
price
compared
to
a
custom
cabinet
is
quite
a
bit
less.

It's
a
very
nice
addition
to
our
remodeled
house.
I've
been
ordering
from
this
firm
for
years
and
continue
to
be
impressed
with
how
they

Water
pump
arrived
when
stated
in
the
FEDEX
tracking
provided
(thanks
for
that).

VERY
well
packed.

I
researched
the
company
who
manufactured
the
pump
so
I'm
expecting
the
installation
to
be
just
as
good.

New
water
pump
was
less
half
the
cost
of
a
rebuilt
one
from
the
local

store.

Will
do
business
again.
I
was
looking
for
a

taillight
and
they
came
through
in

The

may
be
slightly
difficult

navigate,
but
I
found
what
I
was
looking
for,
it
came
quickly,
and
was
in

Will
gladly
use
them
again
in
the
future!
PartsGeek
had
exactly
what
I
needed
and
shipped
it
fast
and
clean!

Their
site
is
easy
to
sort
to
find
the
exact
part
for
YOUR
car
--
make

model
--
even
SUB-models
(I
have
a
Subaru
Impreza
"Outback",
which
can
get
confusing
to
those
that
don't
know
Subarus!).

PartsGeek
had
the
best

too!

Definitely
a
repeat
customer,
for

Way
to

B&H
is
always
the
best
place
for

stuffs
I
thought
I'd
try
these
as
I've
always
used
genuine

before
and
have
read
good
reviews.
These
are
a
bit
cheaper
than
the
originals
and
it
shows.
I
think
you
really
do
get
what
you
pay
for.
The

is
perfectly
drinkable
(I'm
getting
through

but
I
just
prefer
the
compact
packaging,
the
bigger
range
of
strengths
and
flavours
and
the
better
crema
of
the
genuine
Nespresso
capsules.
I've
used

never

It
seems
like
a
great
product
and
really
seems
like
something
that
could
help
performance
and
health,
but
is
way
too
costly.

Yes,
it

I
cannot
say
enough
of
the
service
I
received
from
the
American
RV
Company.

They
walked
me
through
the
ordering
of
the
item
that
I
was
requesting
(RV
water
heater),
which
included
the
exact
model
that
was
for
my
motorhome.


The
actual
cost
of
the
water
heater
from
American
RV
was
much
less
than
from
the
local
and
national
distributors
of
RV
parts
within
my
location
in

About
ten

shipped
from

I
received
all

two
of

in

I
was
refunded
the
money
for
the
two
items
that
I
didn't
receive
(I'm
guessing
they
ran
out
of
stock)
and
aside
from
the
fact
that
the

could've
been
a

clearer
(no

just
the

I
ordered
a
few
things
from
West
Coast
shaving
and
was
impressed
with
the
variety
of
items
they
had,
with
a
much
greater
selection
than
similar
online
stores.
Even
though
I
live
on
the
east
coast,
my
shipment
from
West
Coast

arrived
very
quickly.
My
salesman
was
awesome,
he
was
very
knowledgable
a
and
helpful.
He
did
everything
he
could
to
get
what
I
wanted
and
make
me
happy.
The
reason
to
buy
is
only
an
interesting
price
in
the
articles,
but
in
3
orders
with
golfstoreeurope
only
1
was
a
delivery
time
aceptable,
the
others
probably
was
not
in
stock
and
the
web
page
had
no
the
right
information.
I
experienced
an
excellent
service
with
Reglaze,
they
were
able
to
identify
the
tint
and
darkness
of
the
lenses
I
wanted
from

I
downloaded
from

I
would
recommend

I
used

It
was
so
easy

I
needn't
have
been,
the

and

I

Such

Working

everything
is

They

They

I'd
ordered
this
item
from
another
company
that
claimed
the
item
was
in-stock
ready
to
ship,
but
later
called
and
told
me
that
it
wasn't
and
they
would
have
to
order
it.

It
was
going
to
take
2-3
weeks
before
I
got
my
SB-910
Flash.

They
offered
to
sell
me
a
different
product
for
$130
more.
Can't
fault
it,
as
the
items
I
ordered
where
here
in
the
time
stated.
I'm
not
used
to
shopping
on
line
and
a
bit
of
a
Luddite
when
it
comes
to
using
a
computer
for
more
than
email
and
watching
you-tube!
However,I
found
this
very
easy
to
both
research
my
destination
and
to
book
the
room!

Easy
peasy
lemon
squeezy!
Working
the
graveyard
shift
and
being
in
school
in
the
mornings
can
be
draining
to
the
body.

Luckily,

I
came
across
the
supplements
on
onnit
and
have
noticed
a
change
since
I
started
taking
them.
I'm
able
to
keep
my
focus
and
energy
in
both
school
and
work.

To
top
it
off,

I
still
make
time
to
hit
the
gym
at
least
3
days
a
week.
Try
the
anything
from
onnit!

You
won't
regret
it.
Very
impressed
with
your
service,
and
my
dogs
are
too!

You
saved
us
from
a
trip
to
the
pet
store...and
the
free
shipping
is
great.

You
have
some
new
loyal
customers!
Can't
fault
the
price
and
delivery
time
but
unfortunately
the
3ds
xl
I
purchased
(order
number
SDNR07473)
wasn't
protected
in
the
delivery
box
at
all.
It
was
in
a
box
4
x
larger
than
the
product
and
it
bounced
around
inside.
The
3ds
box
is
slightly
damaged
because
of
this.
the
items
came
as
promised
and
fit

perfectly
and

I
had
never
bought
anything

before,
but
I
am
sure
I
will
buy
more
in
the
future.
I
bought

for

This
was
the
best
price
I
could
find,
and
it
worked
great!
Would
Highly

We
have
used

years

and
have

They

Very
happy
with

service.
Excellent
service
as
always
Vetapprovedrx.com
is
one
of
the
best
websites
on
the
internet.
I
only
stumbled
upon
Vetrx
a
little
under
a
year
ago,
but
my
savings
have
already
been
huge.
My
first
purchase
was
for
joint
supplements
for
my
old
man
puppy.
Getting
the
supplements
from
Vetrx
I
got
40%
more
supplements
for
about
20%
cheaper;
That
is
a
huge
savings.
I
now
purchase
everything
I
need
for
my
best
buddy
from
them
at
incredible
savings.
There
shipping
time
is
also
amazing.
The
longest
I
have
waited
for
and
order
is
five
days.
That
was
an
order
I
placed
at
9P.M.
and
one
of
the
days
was
a
national

holiday;
so
It
was
really
more
like
4
days
or
a
little
less,
which
I
think
is
very
quick.
In
other-words,
I
couldn't
recommend
them
more
highly.
The
value
is
topnotch.the
styles
are
hip.will
continue
to
be
a
customer.
And
have
sent
many
friends
and
family
to
web
site.
Suitcase.com
had
the
cheapest
prices
for
the
suitcase
I
was
looking
to
purchase.
Even
though
ground
shipping
was
free,
I
received
my
suitcase
in
3
days.
Did
a
great
job.
Labels
were
perfect
and
got
to
us
fast.
Thanks
for
always
having
what
I
need
.
Can't
beat
the
prices.
At
first
when
I
opened
the
box
I
tried
the
magnet
I
wasn't
impressed,
but
then
I
discovered
it
had
protected
nylon
disc
between
the
metal
disc
and
the
magnet.
Once
I
parted
the
nylon
disc,
I
saw
how
powerful
it
worked.
Especially
in
erecting
my
metal
shed,
keeping
both
pieces
together
whilst
screwing
it
together,
where
you
cannot
get
a
clamp
in.
Service
is
great

I
have
found
BoilerJuice
the
most
dedicated
company
i
have
ever
come
across,they
want
to
help
you
the

&
get
you
the
best
price
possible
lets
face
it
thats
what
you
want
i
give
them
5*****
give
them
a
try.
Using
the
normal
search
engines,
I
found
this
excellent
web
site,
selecting
and
ordering
the
tyres
was
easy,
choosing
the
garage
(and
able
to
check
out
the
garage
on-line)
along
with
a
convenient
time
to
have
my
tyres
changed
was
simple.
Ottimo
servizio
I
used
Dolphin
for
the
first
time
after
hearing
good
things
from
my
brother
in
law.

I
purchased
3
CNP
products,
Whey/Recover
and
Peptide
which
were
all
very
competitive
compared
to
the
market
place.

All
arrived
the
next
day
by
10am
which
was
very
impressive!

Great
tasting
and
easy
to
mix
so
now
I
just
await
the
results
which
I
am
looking
forward
to.
Its
great
I
never
have
to
worry
about
runnIng
out
of
food
treats
or
any
pet
needs!
As
always
transactions
and
purchases
are
fast

I
ordered
the
lower
intake
manifold
for
a
1999
Windstar,
according
the
web
site
"with
all
seals
and
gaskets".


The
part
arrived
extremely
fast
(2
days)
but
without
those
gaskets.


I
was
told
after
inquiring
with
customer
service
that
the
web
site
was
in
error
and
that
the
part
in
fact
did
not
include
the
gaskets.

The
gasket
set
would
be
another
$90
as
a
separate
item.

I
was
also
given
the
option
of
returning
the
part
for
a
refund
(I
didn't
not
find
out
if
that
would
have
cost
me
shipping).
I
had
ordered

special

They
said
they

it.
After
a

I
called
them,
and
they
said
they
are
out
of
stock.
No
call
or
anything.
Well
I
went
to
this
site,
ordered
the
food
and
here
it
is.
It
was
less
expensive
then
the
other
co.
also.

so
I
could

I
had
the
worst
experience
from

and
I
tried
to

them
to
tell
them
what
happened
and

wouldn't

I
tried
for
20
minutes
to
get
it
to

then
I
decided
I
was
wasting
my
time
because
what
company
actually

about
the
customers??

if
anyone
is
interested...

what

I

that
the

was
only

told

a
trip
for
$3,500
and
I
was
sure
there
was
a
way
to
make
the
$100
available.
They
indicated
that
there
was
not.
I
asked
to
talk
to
a
supervisor
and
was
put
on
hold
for
several
more
minutes.
The
supervisor
came
on
the
phone
and
repeated
the
same
information
and
stated
that
they
did
not
have
the
authority
to
do
anything
about
it.
I
asked
who
would
have
the
authortty,
to
which
he
indicated
that
his
supervisor
would
have
that
authority.
I
asked
to
talk
to
that
person
and
was
put
on
hold
and
subsequently
cut
off.
I

still
believe
that
your
company
could
either
reduce
my
bill
by
$100
dollars
or
find
way
to
give
me
a
credit
I
can
use
on
this
trip.
This
is
the
second
time
I
have
had
a
less
than
satisfactory
experience
with
Travelocity.
I
hesitated
to
use
the
service
but
it
has
been
several
years
and
I
thought
I
would
give
it
another
try.
If
we
can
not
resolve
this
issue
I
will
not
utilizing
Travelocity
in
the
future.

Right

was
looking
for
a
tail
light
for
my
old
Sentra
and
the
Parts
Geek
popped
up
on
the
web.
I
haven't
gotten
the
part
yet...but
I
expect
it
any
day.
I
am
61
years
old
and
not
computer
literate
(let
alone
a
Geek!)
but
I
was
able
to
find
the
part;
pay
for
it
and
get
it
shipped.
I
am
writing
before
it
arrives
because
I
have
every
expectation
that
the
$40
used
light
wil
get
here
based
on
the
smoothness
of
the
ordering
process.
Better
prices
and
better
selection
than
the
big
box
stores.
I
was
blown
away
with
the
speed
and
efficiency
of
this
service.
I
got
what
I
ordered
in
a
timely
fashion
and
everything
was
packaged
well.

However,
the
one
herb
I
REALLY
wanted
and
needed
was
not
in
my
order-Tumeric.

It
was
not
listed
on
the
invoice
so
I
assume
it
just
got
dropped.

I
did
have
quite
a
list.

I
considered
ordering
it
again
but
it
is
all
I
needed
at
the
moment
and
your
shipping
costs
are
very
high
so
I
decided
against
it.
We
are
very
impressed
with
all
aspects
of
First4Magnets
service.
I
always
look
hard
for
the
company
that
has
the
edge
on
the
competition.
After
a
good
search
for
my
hire
car,
this
time
I
returned
to
Arguscarhire.
I
had
the
same
good
experience,
and
they
were
the
cheapest.
The
condition
of
the
car
and
the
personal
service
provided
by
Alamo
(another
company
I
have
previously
used
direct)
were
of
the
best
I
have
experienced.
I
recommend
you
try
Arguscarhire
first
in
your
search.
Good
service,
good
product,
arrived
on
time
with
no
problems.
Would
buy
again
without
reservation.
What
a
great
company.
That's
all
I
can
say.
They
have
an
amazing
selection
of
photography
and
video
equipment
and
have
unbeatable
prices.
I've
only
recently
entered
the
world
of
semi-professional
photography/videography
and
this
site
has
become
my
one-stop-shop
for
all
my
equipment.
If
you're
on
a
budget
like
me,
this
is
a
great
website
to
find
solid
equipment
for
competitive
prices.
I
tried
to
buy
a
boat
7
days
before
July
4th.

Once
my
offer
was
'accepted'
by
the
seller
I
started
getting
bombarded
by
emails
from
different
PopYachts
employees
encouraging
me
to
do
different
things
and
go
through
their
very
elaborate
and
drawn
out
'closing
process'.

First
step
is
to
wire
them
10%
immediately
so
they
don't
sell
the
boat
to
someone
else.
The
offer
is
huge,
the
prices
are
nice,
the
service
is
good.
The
internet
site
is
somewhat
slow.
There
could
be
some
more
to
help
choosing
a
squash
racket.
Good
service
good
price.

I
even
got
a
response
from
the
customer
service
email
when
I
ordered
the
wrong
part
at
first.
GREAT
SERVICE,
WOULD
REALLY
RECOMMEND
THE
SERVICE
TO
ANYONE.
You
have
enabled
me
to
fulfil
my
ambition
to
use
a
really
good
gel
pen
which
is
refillable.
I
found

to
be
very
helpful
and
professional.
They
were
clearly
there
to
assist
in
any
way
they
could.
Great
response
from
their
team.
A
friendly
website,
fast
service
and
at
a
fair
price.

Highly
recommended.
Transfer
drivers
are
very
polite
and
professional.
Parking

I
will

to
use

Bought
a
pair
of
single
vision
glasses
with
transitions
lenses.
I
wanted
specific
type
of
frame
which
were
out
of
stock.
Framesdirect
was
able
to
order
the
frames
for
me
and
the
glasses
were
delivered
a
few
weeks
later.
I
dropped
my
glasses
accidentally
and
scratched
the
right
lense.
I
returned
the
glasses
to
framesdirect
to
see
if
the
lenses
could
be
replaced
under
warranty.
Framesdirect
determined
there
was
a
problem
with
the
scratch
resistant
coating
and
they
replaced
the
lenses
free
of
charge.
Thanks
for
the
great
service!
This
is
the

and
there

be

more
to
come!
Website
layout

easy
to
navigate
and
understand,
great
info
about
the
products
and
I
could
not
find
the
supplements
cheaper
anywhere
else!
We
saved
a
lot
of
money
and
time
by
buying
the
London
Pass.
talk
about
queue
jumping
this
London
Pass
is
the
best.
We
will
be
recommending
it
to
all
our
friends
that
travel
to
Britain.
We
first
rang
up
as
an
enquiry,
then
rang
again
to
get
a
quote
which
we
finally
accepted.
The
assistance
given
plus
the
information
was
great.
The
operator
I
spoke
to
want
out
of
her
way
to
assist
me
with
claer
and
consice
information.
Frames
direct
made
a
mistake
on
a
previous
order
on
a
pair
of
contacts
that
didn't
meet
the
prescription
detail
and
they
credited
my
return.

Therefore,
I
then
purchased
a
high
end
pair
of
rimless
glasses.

This
is
my
second
pair
of
high
end
eye
ware
over
the
past
several
years
from
FramesDirect.

The
first
pair
were
custom
as
the
style
I
liked
wasn't
popular,
but
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
find
a
solution.

This
time
I
found
several
pair
that
wouldn't
make
me
feel
like
I
was
looking
through
a
slit
in
a
pair
of
bent
scissor
handles.

In
each
case
I
experienced
quality
products,
quality
follow
up,
quality
service,
excellent
handling
of
account,
and
ownership
of
responsibility
for
mistakes
if
they
made
one.
I'd
like
things
to
be
cheaper
and
no
delivery
charge.

It's
only
a
piddling
amount
in
relation
to
the
invoice
but
still
annoying
I

at

You

This
is
the

I
have

something

I
must
say
it
definitely
won't
be
the
last.
I

Can't
say
fairer
than
that
I
am
very
impressed
with
their

I
think
I'll
be
a
regular
customer
from
now
on.
I
have
been
a
Digital

customer
for
a
very
long

highly

the

anyone.

I
get
what
I
order
quick
and
with
excellent
prices
Before
using
RushMyPassport,
like
many
online
users,
I
perused
the
reviews.
Many
were
good
but
there
were
also
"horror
stories"
on
some
sites.
In
every
case,
the
"horror
story"
involves
stupidity
and
a
lack
of
research
into
the
passport
process
on
the
part
of
the
customer,
not
any
fault
with
RushMyPassport.
The
most
common
complaint
is
that
the
local
passport
acceptance
agency
makes
them
"wait
2
weeks
for
an
appointment
to
seal
the
documents
for
RMP.com"
-
well
people,
don't
you
think
you
should
have
checked
that
out
first?
Your
local
post
office
being
inefficient
isn't
RMP.com's
fault!
So
when
I
decided
to
purchase
this
service,
I
had
an
appointment
at
my
local
office
(and
all
my
documentation
ready).
My
case
manager
Terry
Price
did
a
fine
job,
emailed
everything
I
needed
including
a
FedEx
label,
had
the
passport
app
sealed,
sent
to
RMP.
Three
days
later
I
had
my
passport,
I
couldn't
be
happier.
Perfect
service
(Price,
Dispatch
&
Delivery
all
excellent)
Great
products
and
friendly,
efficient
service
I
received
the
pants
the
next
day,
exactly
what
I
wanted
but
they
were
too
long.
I
filled
in
a
return
form
which
took
about
10
seconds,
sent
them
back
and
then
received
the
replacement
in
another
day.
Easy!
Ordered
a
Lemforder
lower

arm

Wow.
I
DOUBT
VERY
MUCH
IF
I
WILL
DEAL
WITH
PARTSGEEK
IN
THE
FUTURE,

MY
ORDER
WAS
SHORT
SEVERAL
PARTS
AND
THE
TIME
IT
HAS
TAKEN
TO

THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE.

THERE
ARE
TO
MANY
SITES
TO
ORDER
PARTS
FROM
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
THE
SLOW
RESPONSE
I
HAVE
RECIVED
FROM
PARTSGEEK,
THE
ORDER
HAS
NOT
BEEN
TAKEN
CARE
OF
AS
OF
THIS
REVIEW
IT
IS
NOW
GOING
ON
TO
TWO
WEEKS..
If
I
am
buying
a
camera,
photo
equipment
or
supplies,
or
anything
thing
related
such
as
a
scanner,
I
will
order
it
from
B&H
if
they
carry
the
product.

Their
prices
and
customer
service
are
always
top
notch.

Their
shipping
is
also
first
rate.

Five
star
rating.

I
do
recommend
B&H
to
anyone
buying
photo
or
video
equipment.
We
have
used
Servcorp
at
various
locations
over
the
last
four
years.
The
level
of
service
has
been
consistent
and
flawless.
When
compared
to
their
competitors
in
the
serviced
office/virtual
office
marketplace,
you
will
not
find
a
better
service
anywhere
else.
Partsgeek.com

I

Not

the

I'm
amazed
that

cost
that
much
but
we
had
to
have
them
due
to
poor
visibility
at

They
arrived
with

3

and
because
of
who
they
are
I
am
confident
about
the
origins
and
quality
of
what
they
sell.
From
what
I
have
experienced
so
far,
they
are
competitive
on
price
and
have
fair
charges
for
packing
and
delivery.
My
recent

This

I

twice

and
each

have
been
very

and
the

On
this

I
ordered
a

with

exchanged
it
without

Thank

This
is
my
first
experience
with
this
company.

They
got
the

quickly.

What
else
can
you
ask
for?
Great
prices
and

I
have
been

items
from

for
a
number
of
years
and
have
always
received

and
the

The

I
would
definitely
recommend
this
website
to
unlock
the
iphone,
but
the
time
needed
to
unlock
it
is
way
off.
It
took
them
almost
like
a
week
for
them
to
do
it
while
they
said
only
1
day
at
max
to
unlock.
The
coincidence
is
that
they
unlocked
the
iphone
right
after
I
opened

My

have

and

very

Unfortunately
my
order
hit
the

Holiday
weekend
so
emails
went
unanswered
and

was
delayed,
which
was
frustrating
but
couldn't
be
helped.
Can't
fault
the
prices
and
the

When
I
was
making
my
reservation,
the
agent
mistakenly
made
the
reservation
for
three
nights,
not
two
as
I
requested.
I
had
to
go
back
to
the
site
to
get
it
corrected.
The
mistake
he
made
really
put
me
in
a
financial
bind;
you
can
charge
my
account
immediately,
but
it
takes
several
days
to
get
a
refund.
Why
can't
you
give
me
a
refund
as
quickly
as
you
charge
my
card?
I
will
never
use
your
services
again.
It
was
really
a
plesure
when
I
called
to
make
my
reservation.
The
agent
listen
to
what
I
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
was
very
knowlegeable
with
the
right
procedures
to
secure
my
reservation.
After
everything
was
completed
and
explain
he
ended
the
conversation
by
thanking
me
and
offer
to
be
of
assistance
at
any
time.
Received
the
order
two
days
after
placing
the
order,
and
this
was
free

Great

it

this

the

is
a
little
awkward,
but
can
still
be

and
the
thickness
of

be
a

hard

Mr.
David
Chan
and
Flashbay
have
customer
service
down
to
a
science.
Ordering
from
Flashbay
was
impressive
right
from
the
first
point
of
contact.
Started
with
a
phone
call
after
I
sent
in
an
inquiry.
I
was
then
surprised
by
a
sample
package
the
very
next
day
with
all
the
styles
available.
The
ordering
process
was
super
simple
and
very
fast.
Received
the
final
proof
and
the
finished
product
shortly
thereafter.
Well
done!
the
prices
are
good
but
then
when
you
go
to
book
they
add
on
a
fee
of
£1.95
which
is
weather
you
pay
by
credit
or
debit
so
why
not
just
include
it
in
the
initial
quote
!!!!
Was
contacted
when
i
was
told
i
would
be,
delivery
came
as
expected
unfortunately
i
did
have
a
damaged
toilet
however
this
was
returned
with
the
driver
and
replaced
with
an
upgraded
one
as
the
one
i
had
ordered
was
out
of
stock
.
All
in
all
a
pleasant
expierence
and
fantastic
prices
:-)
I
had
a
limited
order
with
Petflow
--
just
dog
food
--
so
hard
to
judge
overall
how
good
they
are.

But,
Petflow
does
have
a
great
selection
of
dog
food,
including
brands
recommended
by
our
veterinarian.

Ordering
was
easy
(I
used
a
Groupon,
as
well),
and
the
food
arrived
when
expected,
as
expected.

Didn't
set
up
a
recurring
scheduled
order,
which
would
make
this
even
more
convenient
going
forward.
Easy
to
find
cheap
place,
good
description
most
of
the
time,
all
the
information
you
need
in
one
click.
I
called
a
junk
yard
and
was
quoted
a
price
more
than
double
the
price
at
PartsGeek.

I
was
concerned
about
what
the
quality
of
the
part
would
be.

I
ordered
the
part
(back
tail
light),
it
arrived
promptly
and
fit
perfectly.

No
problems
at
all.

It
really
was
a
no-brainer....quality
part
for
less
money.
Always
great
doing
business
with
B&H
;
the
best
online
retailer
for
all
your
professional
needs!
I
recommend
them
100%
I
had
been
searching
for
an
emerald
cut
diamond
with
a
specific
carat
weight
(sentimental
reasons)
for
many
months.
Brilliance.com
has
a
great
site
where
you
can
type
in
your
own
specifications
to
find
the
exact
diamond
you
are
looking
for.
After
several
months
of
searching
I
realized
that
the
exact
same
stone
(identical
GIA
reports)
can
be
found
on
several
different
diamonds
for
sale
websites.
In
every
single
comparison
I
did
Brilliance.com
was
the
cheapest...always...generally
between
$200.00
and
$500.00.
When
I
placed
my
order
I
was
sent
an
email
back
immediately
informing
me
that
they
would
contact
me
with
the
availability
of
the
stone.
This
happened
the
next
day
and
the
diamond
was
shipped
immediately.
I
recommend
every
aspect
of
Brilliance.com
from
website
to
ordering
to
shipping
and
to
follow-up
for
customer
satisfaction.

Found
exactly
what
i'd
been
looking
for
with
no
trouble
and
received
the
part

the

I
had
expected
it
to
arrive.

Will
be
back
for
more
in
the

Bought
a
saddle
and
some
pedals
from
Merlin
a
couple
of
weeks
ago...
they
took
less
than
a
week
to
arrive
in
Melbourne,
Australia!

The
prices
on
Merlin
are
also
generally
better
than
PBK
and
CRC...
but
PBK
returns
policy
is
better
-
Merlin
won't
pay
return
postage
for
even
warranty
problems
-
but
I've
never
had
to
put
them
to
the
test
so
I
can't
speak
from
experience.

The
pedals
had
fallen
out
of
the
packaging
when
they
arrived
and
could
have
been
better
protected
(although
were
sent
in
a
bubble
wrap
sachel,
which
is
better
than
PBK's
plastic
sachels).
Good
selection
of
OEM
and
OES
parts.

Partsgeek
had
what
I
needed,
and
the
parts
shipped
from
a
warehouse
less
than
40
miles
from
my
house
so
I
got
the
parts
the
next
day
with
standard
ground
shipping.
Parts
Geek
has
great
prices
and
fast
shipping.
Will
use
them
again
as
needed.
The
web
site
is
easy
to

and
use,
and
the

process

smoothly
Every
thing
came
on
time
and
as
ordered,
will
use
them
again.
Everything
met
my
expectations
and
I
would
use
this
company
again
in
the
future.

My

and
I
wanted
to
thank
you
and
your
company.

In
particular,
Mr.
Jacoby
Watson
for
his

caring,
warm,
and

professional
demeanor.
The
difficult
to
find
parts
(tires
and
tubes)
were
delivered
efficiently
within
a
few
days.
The
tubes
to
the
tires
ordered
had
a
European
valve
however,
much
smaller
than
I
had
previously
seen.
I
sent
an
email
questioning
the
tube
valves
which
was
not
answered.
Googling
the
valves,
I
learned
about
them,
and
that
an
adapter
to
my
pump
was
necessary.
Installation
went
smoothly,
and
I
am
pleased
that
my
old
worn
tires
with
leaking
tubes,
have
been
replaced
with
a
sharp
looking
tires
which
don't
leak.
Maybe
my
question
was
too
dumb.

well,
literally
unbeatable
since
they
price
match,
which
is
heaven
but
when
I
got
to
the
shopping
cart
I
saw
all
of
these
offers
for
supposedly
free
items
such
as
shaker
bottles
and
headphones.

Luckily
I
knew
my
shipping
before
I
added
these
items
because
the
shipping
went
up
by
5
dollars
for
each
of
the
"free"
items
I
picked.

I
was
pretty
bummed
that
the
site
scams
us
like
that.
Very
quick

I
am
currently
deployed
and
have
used
this
site
multiple
times.
I
get
my
products
quicker
than
I
get
packages
from
home!
I
have
even
been
able
to
get
a
couple
others
in
my
unit
to
use
the
site
as
well.
Most
places
do
not
even
offer
APO
shipping,
the
products
and
prices
are
uncomparable.
Even
with
the
shipping
prices
being
what
they
are,
they
are
still
cheaper
than
not
being
able
to
get
quality
products
shipped
over
here
while
deployed.

I
have
used
Shower
Doctor
Ltd
in
the
past
and
have
had
nothing
but
praise
for
them.
Unfortunately
on
this
occasion
the
complete
opposite.
I
ordered
a
replacement
part
for
my
shower
(same
part
as
the
previous
order)
anyway
after
a
number
of
telephone
calls
trying
to
locate
the
part,
I
was
told
it
had
not
being
processed.
Then
the
following
day
received
an
E-Mail
saying
it
was
on
its
way.
The
following
day
a
part
arrived
over
a
week
after
placing
the
order.
I
checked
on
the
web
site
and
the
part
numbers
matched,
but
the
parts
supplied
did
not
look
the
same
as
on
the
web
site
nor
did
they
fit.
after
yet
another
phone
call
I
was
informed
that
the
whole
batch
was
wrong.
At
this
point
I
decided
to
give
up
and
buy
a
new
shower,
Shower
Doctor
supplied
me
with
their
best
price
which
I
have
not
accepted
as
it
was
just
under
£65
more
than
the
price
I
paid
locally.
I
hope
this
is
just
a
blip
by
the
company.

included.
Super
pleased
as
I've
not
found
anyone
else
that
sells
them.
I
needed
a
pow/steering

for
a
99

(only
available
from
Toyota)
and
was
ridiculously
priced
at
$202.00
list.
Parts
geek
had
it
for
$117.00
and
was
OE
Toyota
part.
It
was
by
far
the
lowest
online
price
I
found.
Couldn't
have
asked
for
a
better
service.
Dropping

off
ok
guy
was
there
and
he
said
when
we
return
give
their
guy
£2
and
he
gets
us
out
of
carpark.


On
arriving
back
in
UK
at
-6deg
our
car
was
delivered
back
to
us
covered
in
snow,
my
wife
had
to
travel
in
the
back
as
the
passenger
door
was
frozen,
we
paid
the
guy
£2
+
tip
but
he
wasn't
too
sure
about
the
procedure
when

we
got
to
the
barrier
we
were
asked
to
pay
£3.80
we
explained
the
situation
but
he
was
having
none
of
it
I
had
to
go
to
machine
and
pay
a
further
£3.80
after
holding
people
up.


My
wife
rang
SkyPark
and
the
guy
said
Oh
sorry
about
that
but
was
unable
to
come
back
to
car
park
to
sort
it
out
he
said
we
could
go
to
his
office
and
be
re-inburrsed
but
after
the
flight
and
confusion
we
just
wanted
to
get
home.


We
were
told
that
the
car
would
be
kept
under
cover
but
obviously
was
not
I
think
the
least
they
could
have
done
was
defrost
passenger
door
so
my
wife
could
get
in
and
maybe
clear
snow
from
rear
so
we
could
open
the
boot
easier
to
put
our
cases
in.


A
good

disappointed

The

No

I'd

and
highly

it

it

I
was
looking
for
some
specific
parts
for
my
93
Mercedes
300E
and
upon
calling
my
local
auto
parts
store,
none
had
them
in
stock.

I
began
searching
on
the
internet
to
order
them
myself
and
found
most
places
had
on
of
the
parts
in
stock
and
not
both.

PartsGeek
was
the
only
place
that
had
them
both
in
stock
and
at
the
lowest
price.

I
expected
it
to
take
a
week
for
delivery
and
to
my
surprise
I
found
UPS
knocking
on
my
door
3
days
after
I
ordered
them.

For
that
kind
of
price
and
service,
I
would
recommend
PartsGeek
to
anyone.

Thanks
for
making
my
repairs
a
breeze!

the

I
only

I
ordered
and
was
shipped
quickly.
I
have
been
impressed
with
Brilliance.
I
initially
ordered
a
diamond
that
after
their
customer
service
looked
at
was
lower
quality
than
I
thought
and
helped
me
order
a
new
one
quickly
and
with
no
hassle.
Their
packaging
was
also
very
good.
Safe,Fast
but
expensive,
7
dollars

Very
pleasant
and
simple
website
to
use.
There
aren't

pages
and
pages
of
data
to
enter,
filling
out
endless
fields
with
information
that
have
no
relevance
before
getting
timed-out
and
starting
over.
This
G23
raincoat
is
beautifully
clean
in
it's
design
and
it
fitted
me
a
treat.
However,
the
quality
is
low.
It's
made
in
Turkey.
Mine
arrived
with
stitching
missing
from
the
back
vents
and
loose
buttons.
It
was
the
last
one
in
stock
so
i
kept
it,
took
it
to
a
seamstress
for
repairs
and
got
a
25%
refund.
A
fault
less
process.
Good
prices,
fantastic
delivery
speed.
We
had
several
bad
experience
on
the
Big
Bus
Tours
in
London.

First,
several
of
the
drivers
and
guides
did
not
know
whether
the
bus
we
were
on
was
going
back
to
"Green
Park"
where
we
started
our
day.


Second,
once
the
bus
driver
and
guide
decided
that
we
were
going
back
to
Green
Park,
they
decided,
without

telling
anyone,
that
we
were
not
going
back/

We
had
to
exit
the
bus
and
take
a
taxi
at
our
expense.
My
neighbour
Sara
was
in
trouble.

Her
lodgers
rely
on
the
electric
shower
as
they
both
work
in
a
dusty
environment.

I
got
an
urgent
phone
call
from
her
on
Thursday
morning
just
before
the
Bank
Holiday,
saying
that
she
had
no
water
coming
from
her
shower.

I
had
the
key
so
checked
it
out
and
immediately
realised
it
was
the
water
inlet
solenoid
that
was
open
circuit.
I
looked
on
line
and
found
ShowerDoc
had
the
part
in
stock
so
I
ordered
it
and
told
her
it
was
going
to
be
Tuesday
before
I
could
get
it
working.

Wrong.

On
Saturday
morning
it
was
delivered
by
post
and
by
the
afternoon
I
had
it
fitted
and
working.

One
habby
neighbour...
and
tenants.
So
I
was
looking
for
a
new
backpack
for
the
new
school
year
and
considering
that
I've
been
using
the
same
backpack
for
4
years
now,
it
was
time
for
a
change.
It's
my
last
year
in
high
school
this
year
and
I
wanted
to
go
out
in
a
bang.
As
I
was
going
through
the
backpacks,
It
was
the
most
hardest
moment
of
my
life!
There
were
so
many
options
to
go
to
everything
looked
nice
and
I
couldn't
decide!
So
as
I
was
looking,
I
asked
my
friends
for
their
opinion
as
well.
As
soon
as
I
asked
them,
they
started
wanting
to
buy
their
own
backpack
as
well!
I'm
really
glad
I
chose
this
site
to
find
my
backpack!
Still
haven't
received
my
second
order
but
feel
confident
that
Cloud9
is
on
my
side.
Super,
Smashing,
Great
:-)




Easy
website
to
use,

Barcode

Great

But

We
reserved
a
large
minivan
for
a
tour
of
Southern
Spain.

The
vehicle
was
upgraded
from
an
Opel
to
a
beautiful
near
new
Mercedes.

The
counter
person
was
very
friendly
at
the
Budget
rent
a
car
and
gave
us
some
good
advice.

A
word
of
advice
that
I
should
have
known
in
retrospect,
old
city
centers
are
not
conducive
to
large
minivans!!
We
were
in
a
pickle
a
number
of
times
and
a
few
pictures
and
videos
of
us
were
taken
in
Cordoba
and
Grenada!
I
ordered
Barbours
fingerless
gloves
online
at
1300
Friday
and
receieved
them
in
Saturday

morning's
post.

Couldn't
ask
for
better
service
-
and
gloves
are
ideal
for
working
at
keyboard
in
cool
room.
Best
price,
instant
delivery,
genuine
products,
no
requirement
to
find
your
prescription
-
just
enter
details
off
your
previous
box
of
lenses.
Perfect.
Na
jarenlang
met
Magento
te
hebben
gewerkt
hebben
we
bij
Cortana
begin
2012
de
overstap
gemaakt
naar
SEOshop.
Very
simple
process
to
order.
My
part
was
quickly
processed
and
shipped.

I
received
the
part
in
a
few
days
complete
as
expected.

Part
works.
No
problem.
Will
order
from
company
again.
the
parts
were
all
right,
some
didn't
fit
quite
right,
the
price
was
great,
but
the
shipping
carrier
that
Parts
Geek
used
was
a
BIG
JOKE
!
The
parts
were
promised
on
a
thursday
and
no
updates
were
given
on
where
they
were
on
tracking
so
i
had
to
call
the
shipper
and
finaly
got
a
straight
answer
after
about
5
phone
calls.
They
showed
up
a
week
later.
So
they
say
7
to
10
days
but
what
they
mean
is
30
days.
Thats
how
long
it
took.
and
forget
about
calling
Parts
Geek
for
info.....
they
will
not
answer
the
phone
nor
respond
to
e-mails.
The
entire
transaction
was
handled
professionally
as
always.
Would
recommend
to
everybody.
Quality
of
toners
is
excellent.
Hey,
I
received
my
window
motor
and
regulator
very
quickly
and
the
part
bolted
right
in
and
worked
beautifully.

Very
pleased,
fast
service,
great
price
and
accurate
fit!
Lots
of
choice
and
easy
to
book
are
why
I
have
booked
twice
with
SkyparkSecure.
I
bought
a
pair
of
CHIC
Bar
stools.
Really
good
service.
One
of
the
stools
were
faulty
and
they
promptly
replaced
it
as
well
as
send
us
some
spare
parts
free.
Would
recommend
them
to
anyone
We
had
a
good
service
from
bathempire
although
we
ended
up
having
to
return
some
items
which
were
sent
to
us
even
though
we
had
cancelled
them
before
despatch.
Definitely
has
raised
the
bar
by
no
gimmicks,
true
narrative
and
a
way
to
try
samples
of
products
before
committing.
I
was
kept
informed
of
a
slight
delay

in
the
despatch
of
my
small
order
by
telephone,
and
to
check
that
this
was
OK.
I

think

this
is
good

personal

service

and
should
be
adopted

by
all

Businesses!!
There
was
a
small
O
ring
missing
from
the
Package
which
caused
a
lot
of
problems
and
time
wasting.
In
a
matter
of
a
couple
hours,
I
had
a
professional-looking
website
with
all
the
info
and
pictures
I
wanted
to
use
--
to
sell
my
motorcoach/RV!

And,
I
have
updated
my
information
and
pictures
a
few
times;
it
was
extremely
easy
to
use
--
and
very
reasonably
priced.
Purchased
2
pair
of
these
Ray
Bands
...one
for
my
wife
and
the
other
for
me
....great
service
and
top
glasses......will
buy
again
.....
Excellent
service,
goods
arrived
the
next
day,have
used
Heinnie
Hays
for
many

years
and
will
continue
to
do
so.
Ordered
two
Ac
condensers
from
them
and
order
processed
quickly.
Had
a
problem
with
delivery
with
one
unit
but
Ingram's
quickly
fixed
the
problem.
It's
an
excellent
service.

The
guitar
came
the
following
day
and
it
was
in
perfect
nick.

I
wish
there
was
an
option
for
a
longer
delivery
period
though.

It
was
£19
for
next
day
delivery,
which
is
fine,
but
if
there
was
an
option
for
cheaper,
slower
delivery,
I'd
have
chosen
that.
I
wanted
an
old
fragrange
that
I
could
not
find
anywhere
and
then
found
this
sight.
I
ordered
the
fragrance
at
a
great
price
and
it
was
quickly
delivered.
No
hassels
no
problems100%
satisified
I
called
them
before
I
placed
my
order
to
ask
a
few
questions
and
was
very
satisfied
with
the
way
I
was
treated
which
was
very
professional
and
made
me
feel
confident
to
place
my
order
online.

I
was
told
my
order
would
be
delivered
the
next
day
and
I
was
sent
an
e
mail
telling
me
it
would
be
delivered
in
between
a
one
hour
time
span
and
it
was
done.
What
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
knowing
you
are
getting
professional
service
and
top
quality
products.
Product
packaged
well
in
brand
new
box.

Excellent
product,
exactly
as
described.
Delivery
fairly
quick
to
Australia.
I
liked
the
fact
that
it
was
easy
to
pick
a
card
and
add
money.

The
fact
that
there
were
a
lot
of
designs
in
many
different
categories
was
a
huge
help.

I
also
appreciated
that
the
card
could
be
sent
anonymously.

I
have
an
old
friend
that
is
fighting
cancer
and
needed
support
to
feed
his
family
while
he
is
out
of
work
dealing
with
the
illness.

I
wanted
to
help
but
I
did
not
want
him
to
feel
like
he
owed
me.

Through
the
grace
of
God
and
with
help
from
your
site,
I
was
able
to
send
money
his
way
to
help
keep
the
family
going.
I’m
customer
since
few
months.
I
can
only
recommend
T4L.
I’m
always
been
supported
in
an
excellent
way,
and
the
quality
of
fabrics
and
of
finishes
is
every
new
order
better.
A
lot
of
attention
to
customer’s
suggestions
and
a
final
product

absolutely
good.
Having
used
Blackcirckels
on
a
number
of
occassions
I
have
found
the
service
acurate,
informative
and,
on
the
one
time
where
the
garage,
not
blackcircle,
let
us
down
then
black
circles
were
speedy,
and
willing
to
help
resolve
the
problem
Have
used
pureformula
products
in
the
past..
Will
continue
to
do
so.
Sometimes
delivery
is
slow,
but
has
always
been
accurate.

The
clothing
is
exactly
as
described.
The
fit
is
as
described.
I
have
been
very
happy
with
the
tops
and
dresses
that
I
have
ordered.
3
orders
so
far,
very
pleased,
will
order
more.
Just
wish
shipping
was
free
after
a
certain
amount
even
with
a
discount.
Until
this
morning
I
got
my
email
from
these
guys
and
BAM!!!
Great

The
mechanic
was
experienced
in
working
on

cars
&
arrived
on
time
with
all
needed

He
even
called
ahead
to
confirm
that
he
was
on
his
way.
I
knew
exactly
what
the
price
was
before
he
even
started.
The
total
was
half
the
price
quoted
by
the
Toyota
dealer
for

I
was
very
impressed
with
the
whole
process.

Placed
order
nearly
2
weeks
before
Christmas
and
the
date
keeps
changing.
It
is
Christmas
Eve
today
and
now
my
package
says
expected
delivery
in
3
more
days,
Dec
27,
not
cool
cuz
this
was
a
Christmas
gift.
Talked
to
service
rep
and
she
said
nothing
she
could
do
so
I
called
back
to
the
"corporate
office"
2
minutes
later
and
the
exact
person
answered
the
phone,
must've
been
a
speedy
promotion.
Shame
on
you...all
in
all,
after
leaving
her
supervisor
a
voice
message,
as
she
was
off
of
course,
I
also
contacted
customer
service
thru
email...I
was
given
a
code
for
5%
on
my
NEXT
order!!!
Geez,
don't
break
the
bank!
Extremely
disappointed!
I
do
understand
that
this
is
not
entirely
SW's
fault
as
my
ordered
had
been
transferred
to
FEDEX
on
the
17th,
but
if
they
are
going
to
continue
to
use
FEDEX
then
I
will
hold
them
accountable
for
it
taking
me
several
weeks
to
receive
my
order,
especially
when
my
checking
account
had
been
charged
immediately.

I
will
gladly
pay
a
few
more
dollars
next
time
at
GNC
to
have
product
in
hand
when
they
have
my
hard
earned
$
in
theirs
Excellent

the

Supplement

always

Over

never

There
is
no
reason
I
would

them.
The
amount
of

given
between
purchase
and
delivery
was
very
good
and
I
knew
exactly
when
to
expect
my

(not
that
it
took
long
at
all).
The

I

was

I

They're

They

It
was
so
easy
to
find
and
get
the
part
that
I
was
looking
for.

The
price
was
a
big
selling
point
for
me.
Up
until
a
month
ago
I
didn't
know
Merlin
Cycles
even
existed,
I
was
in
search
for
a
new
groupset
and
after
much
web
searching
and
veiwing,
Merlin
came
out
way
in
front,
not
only
were
their
prices
way
below
everyone
else,
they
proceeded
to
give
further
discounts.
The
shipping
was
done
by
teleporting
or
seemed
so
with
the
package
arriving
2
days
later
over
here
in
OZ.
Extremely
pleased,
a
great
product,
(
know
the
trustees
will
be
overjoyed)
and
the
work
was
done
in
a
timely
fashion.

Everything
went
better
than
I
expected.
Flexible
friendly
and
efficient
I
wanted
to
start
using
a
fountain
pen
but
I
didn't
want
to
spend
very
much.

High
street
stores
had
a
disappointing
selection
so
I
looked
online
and
found
Cult
Pens.

They
have
a
very
wide
range
of
all
sorts
of
pens
and
I
selected
one
from
the
lower
end
of
the
price
range.

I
suspect
it's
really
aimed
at
the
classroom
but
it's
perfect
for
me.
The
job
was
done
fast,
accurate,
without
a
hitch.
If
you
need
a
Brazilian
visa
they
will
walk
you
through
each
step
and
you
can
catch
your
plane
on
time
and
enjoy
yourself.
We
have
been
ordering
from
this
company
for
well
over
a
year
now
and
have
always
received
top
notch
service
with
any
questions
and
quality
parts.
Very
good
company
to
deal
with.

Fast
response
to
my
questions.

Very
fast
shipping
and
a
quality
product.
I
am
happy
with
the
service
Trusting
and
helpful
staff.
I
can
find
what
I
need
for
my
vehicles,
at
any
time
and
order
when
i
want,
returns
are
not
a
problem
and
my
money
is
credited
it
a
timely
fashion.

I
am
no
longer
a
ATM
to
my
mechanic,
who
always
charges
me
extra
for
parts
and
labor.

Thank
you
I
tried
to
order
my
parts
on
another
website
and
had
problems
getting
the
order
to
go
through.

Found
PartsGeek,
order
took
less
than
5
minutes,
had
the
parts
the
next
day.
Shipping
costs
were
minimal,
will
use
them
next
time
I
order.
One
part
failed
to
ship
but
after
I
called
the
part
was
expidited
and
I
received
it
2
days
later.
Other
than
that
all
parts
arrive
on

and
in
good
condition.

Really
satisfied
with
my

from
Barbour
that
I
received
just
four
days
from

and
I
am
in
Sweden!!
No

and
on
top
of
that
a
free

You
got
to
be
kidding!
I
brought
my
Rolex
to

and
some
clean
up.

It
came
back
looking
like

amazing.

They
did
some
light
polishing
of
the

It

Highly
recommmend

We

service
that
was
reliable.

BigBustours
fit
the
bill.

Buses
were
clean
and
dependable.

We
purchased
the
2
day
pass.

This
was
a
great
option.

On
the
second
day
we
used
the
river
cruise
which
brought
us
down
to
Greenwich.

Marvelous
city
and
would
highly
recommend
the
2
day
pass
which
included
the
extended
river
cruise.

If
in
London,
would
definitely
use
them
again.
Give

i
was
pleasently
suprised
by

also
the
availability
as
no

As

arrived
very
fast
with
everything
included
and
as
pictured
on
the
website.
First
time
geting
parts
on
your
site
"PartsGeek"
very
good
experience,very
professional,the
price
is
right,Fast
delivery,
I
have
something
in
mind,I
will
contact
you
soon.
My
printer
requires
genuine
(epson)
cartridges.
The
ones
from
InkFarm
did
not
work
at
all.
How
do
I
get
a
refund?
Service
was
great.
I
was
looking
for
quick
disconnects
for
my
Badger
and
Harbor
Freight
air
brushes.
Chicago
had
a
great
variety
but
even
the
service
guys
could
not
answer
critical
questions
about
thread
size,
diameters,
hoses,
etc.

I'll
cut
them
some
slack
blaming
the
manufacturer's
not
providing
the
information.

There
has
to
be
someone
ready
to
take
up
the
view
from
the
consumer
who
is
caught
in
the
middle
ordering
something
we
may
or
may
not
know
will
fit.

Despite
this
frustration,
I
ended
with
a
positive
experience.
It
also
speaks
to
the
saying
buy
everything
from
one
brand,
but
how
is
a
novice
to
know
that
and
what
professional
uses
just
one
brush?
Details,
details,
details
please
will
increase
sales.
Have
used
these
guys
a
few
times
now
and
they've
always
delivered
on
time
with
the
correct
order
of
high
quality
goods.

Can't
ask
for
more
than
that!

you'd
expect

I
got
everything

small
items
that

by

Great

Our
family
really
enjoyed
using
The
Paris
Pass
throughout
the
city
and
everywhere
we
went.

It
was
the
greatest
experience
we
ever
had
visiting
every
museum
(including
the
Louvre
and
the
Musee
d'Orsay).

We
would
totally
recommend
every
one
use
the
Paris
Pass
every
where
you
can.

You
will
find
that
it
brings
the
greatest
joy
and
delight
to
your
family
and
your
kids
when
they
get
to
experience
everything
throughout
Paris
(including
the
Palace
at
Versailles).
We
really
enjoyed
rneting
our
car
through
Auto
Europe
and
found
everything
about
the
car
to
be
amazing.

The
car
was
fast,
economical
and
really
easy
to
drive.

Everywhere
we
went
we
found
the
experience
to
be
the
best
we
could
have
ever
imagined.

We
would
highly
recommend
Auto
Europe
to
anyone
who
ever
wants
to
rent
a
car
in
Europe.

The
service
received
was
great,
I
received
an
email
with
a
delivery
date
and
received
the
item
when
it
was
suggested.
I
was
that
impressed
I
called
to
their
shop
on
Saturday
and
picked
up
a
helmet
for
my
children
and
some
other
bits.
Great
shop
and

Very

would
be
right
for

1998

and
I
ordered

I
received
the

the
very

Installed

The
only
thing
I
didn't

is
it

I
recently
got
back
into
Model
Railroading
and
have
been
buying
most
of
my
supplies
on
the
internet.

I
found
Hobby
Linc
and
noted
they
have
good
prices
so
over
the
past
6
months
I
have
spent
well
over
$3,000.
on
their
site
without
a
problem.

On
my
most
recent
order
I
received
my
shipment
and
1
item
was
noted
to
be
broken
in
the
package
and
another
one
was
not
in
a
package
but
loose
in
the
Box
with
the
package
opened
and
left
in
the
box...
there
were
also
parts
Missing.

I
contacted
the
company
and
I
was
told
since
I
did
not
pay
for
insurance
I
could
return
the
items,
but
I
would
have
to
pay
for
shipping?

I
told
them
the
Box
the
items
arrived
in
was
not
damaged
and
therefore
insurance
would
not
have
covered
it...
the
Items
were
shipped
in
a
damaged
state.

I
was
told
that
if
you
did
not
pay
for
insurance
then
they
did
not
pay
for
the
return
even
if
it
is
their
fault.


I
questioned
them
about
this
and
I
was
told
I
would
have
to
deal
with
the
manufacturer
for
the
Item
that
was
received
damaged
in
the
Box.


I
asked
why
it
was
my
responsibility
to
deal
with
the
manufacturer
if
Hobby
Linc
sent
out
damaged
goods
to
begin
with?


I
was
told
that
was
their
policy.


I
pointed
out
that
their
"policy"
allowed
them
to
put
items
they
had
on
hand
that
were
damaged
in
their
warehouse
into
a
box
going
to
a
customer
and
them
have
the
customer
deal
with
their
damaged
items
!
I
used
PetFlow.com
for
my

and
look
forward
to
doing

with
them
again.

Discount
Supplements
offer
a
speedy,efficient
and
economical
service
which
I
feel
is
second

such
a

from
ordering
online
to
the

Discount

My

as
quickly
as

and
also
I'd

a

my

due
a

So,
good
news
for
me!
Okay,
it's
not
selling
the
sexiest
stuff
but
hey
I
needed
a
to
store
my
winter
duvet
and
it
was
good

and
does
the
job.
Sadly,
I've
had
to
take
back
out
of
the
cupboard
as
this
stupid
country
is
freezing
cold
again!
Bring
on
the
summer.
Simple
idea.
Kinda
wondering
why
no-one's
done
it
before.
They've
got
all
the
stuff
you
want
to
search
and
it's
nicely
arranged
and
displayed.
Reminds
me
of
Trulia
in
the
States
a
bit.
Nice
idea.
Love
the
idea,
beautiful
website,
great
holidays
on
there.
Also,
the
lady
in
their
TV
ads
is
HOT.
Chucked
them
a
bunch
of
stuff.
Some
they
junked
but
they
got
my
approval
first
having
told
me
it
was
worthless
-
fair
enough,
they're
the
ones
in
the
know
and
at
least
I
didn't
have
to
take
it
to
the
dump
myself
-
but
they
got
me
a
great
price
for
my
panasonic
50"
plasma.
Nice
one.

Doing

with

an
absolute
pleasure.

Your

have
forgotten
how
far
a
simple
word
of
politeness
can
go.
when
I
placed
my
order
I
didn't
get
a
confirmation
so
I
thought
the
order
wasn't
placed.

I
replaced
my
order.

Later
I
discovered
my
credit
card
was
run
twice
and
the
product
was
shipped
twice.

Forget
about
calling
and
getting
somebody
on
the
phone.

I
made
multiple
calls
with
no
success.

The
only
time
I
could
get
a
live
person
was
when
I
said
I
wanted
to
order
something
but
they
couldn't
help
me.

I
went
online
and
sent
an
e-mail
hoping
to
get
a
response
in
the
48hr
timeframe.

A
week
later
I
still
have
not
gotten
a
response.

I'll
get
more
aggressive
this
week.

What
a
hassle.

The
savings
in
this
case
just
weren't
worth
it
as
I've
paid
for
the
part
twice
and
still
have
to
spend
time
getting
my
money
back.
The
no
quibble
guarantee
promised
when
ordering
is
a
bit
of
a
joke.
I
received
a
faulty
cartridge,
which
I
returned
to
get
an
acknowledgement

no
mean

Hopefully
I
have
received
a
promised
refund
after
all
the
efforts.
On
spec,
on
time.
Unable
to
keep
an
appointment.
I
had
to
rearrange
plans
for
the
afternoon.
When

I
rang
the
head-office
and
spoke
to
Andrew,
they
did
not
do
as
promised
which
was
to
call
me
back.
I
noticed
that
one
of
the
tire's
on
my
wife's
car
was
slowly
leaking
air
and
took
the
car
to
Town
Fair.

I
was
immediately
waited
on
by
a
representative,
who
went
out
to
the
car
for
a
visual
inspection
and
immediately
noticed
a
screw
in
the
tread
near
the
sidewall.

The
rep
explained
the
policy
for
repair
(impossibly
because
of
location
of
puncture).
As
this
was
the
third
tire
of
the
same
make
(Pirelli)
to
fail
on
the
same
car
and
because
this
tire
is
expensive,
I
was
less
than
thrilled.

The
rep
had
the
tire
in
the
store,
quickly
arranged
for
service,
which
was
completed
while
I
waited.

Service
was
fast
and
efficient.
Rep
knew
his
business.
Not
much
more
I
could
ask
for.

I

I

that

mention
must
go

centre
who
we
now
use
for
other

Ordered
the
parts
on
Tuesday
had
them
by
Friday
to
install
over
the
weekend.
They
came
from
three
different
warehouses
and
were
all
delivered
within
a
day
of
each
other.
Exactly
what
I
ordered
and
I
will
be
back
Good
price
after
comparing
with
other
sites.
Very
efficient.
Good
delivered
within
48
hours
of
ordering.
Had
a
text
day
before
to
say
would
be
delivered,
and
a
text
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
deliver
with
a
one
hour
time
slot.
I
ordered
it
and
two
days
later
it
was
delivered.
Cant
ask
for
more
than
that.
I
ordered
a
Silentnight
double
divan
bed
and
am
very
pleased
with
it.
The
bed
took
quite
a
long
time
to
be
delivered
as
it
was
not
in
stock
at
the
time
I
ordered
it
but
this
was
something
that
I
had
been
advised
at
the
time
of
ordering.
The
biggest
negative
though
is
the
cost
of
delivery
and
the
fact
that
a
separate
charge
was
made
to
take
away
my
old
bed
and
mattress.
There
are
other
bed
retailers
who
either
only
make
one
small
charge
for
delivery
and
no
charge
for
removing
the
old
bed
or
in
some
cases
make
no
delivery
charges
at
all.
I
ordered
an
item
which
was
shown
on
the
website
(a
reel
of
Yonex
BG65TI
badminton
string
in
Yellow).
Eventually
after
several
days
I
received
an
e-mail
advising
that
the
item
was
out
of
stock
and
now
unobtainable.
An
unsuitable
alternative
was
offered
(
a
reel
of
Red
string).
I
pointed
out
that
I
could
buy
the
red
string
much
cheaper
elsewhere

(£50
instead
of
Tennisnuts'
price
of
£65)
and
was
only
interested
in
the
Yellow
string
and
therefore
requested
a
refund.
Instead
of
immediately
giving
a
refund
they
sent
another
e-mail
offering
the
unwanted
red
string
cheaper
than
TennisNuts'
original
price
but
at
£60
i.e
still
£10
more
than
I
told
them
I
could
buy
it
for!
??
It
took
two
more
chasing
e-mails
to
get
a
refund
for
an
order
that
I
would
never
have
placed
if
their
website
had
correctly
shown
that
this
item
was
not
in
stock/unavailable.
I
consider
this
to
be
extremely
poor
service
and
fortunately
my
regular
supplier
of
racket
strings
is
far
more
efficient.
The
whole
experience
from
the
site
to
the
choices,
are
set
up
for
ease
of
use.

The
process
is
set
up
to
make
this
easy
for
anyone
to
use.
I've
been
buy
parts
from
PartsGeek
for
a
few
years
now.

As
my
vehicle
now
has
over
250k
miles,
some
original
parts
are
starting
to
go.
While
shopping
for
parts,
I've
noticed
that
PartsGeek
not
only
sells
the
same
parts
as
I
would
get
from
the
dealer,
but
that
the
prices
are
a
lot
cheaper.
The
parts
I
buy
from
PartsGeek
are
also
cheaper
than
having
my
mechanic
order
the
same
items
from
his
parts
guy.
I
highly
recommend
PartsGeek.com.
You
know
what
they
say....."If
you
can
find
it
cheaper
somewhere
else,
go
somewhere
else!"
Easy
to
find
what
i
wanted,
easy
to
order,
and
my
rucksack
arrived
within
48
hrs.
No
complaints
at
all.
Highly
recommended.

I
am
always
happy
how
much
you
can
save
on
supplements
on
this
site,
but
it
took
2
weeks
to
even
ship
out
my
$300
order,
and
I
didn't
receive
it
for
another
2
weeks.

It
is
vitally
important
to
ship
out
APO
orders
as
soon
as
possible,
because
after
it
ships
it
takes
at
least
1
to
2
weeks
more
than
domestic
orders
to
get
to
its
destination.

Plus,
spending
that
much
should
qualify
for

as
well.

their
website.
On
both
occasions
the
order
was
despatched
quickly,
communication
was
good
and
delivery
went
without
any
problem,
even
to
the
point
that
I
had
an
email
telling
what
time
the
delivery
would
be.
I
am
very
satisfied
with
the
whole
experience.
Service
was
excellent.
I'd
made
a
mistake
on
my
parcel
details
and
was
panicking
big
time,
but
Samantha
at
P2G
(the
customer
service
advisor)
helped
me
sort
out
the
mistake
and
also
put
my
mind
at
rest
by
checking
the
details
of
all
the
other
parcels
that
I
had
booked.

Excellent
customer
service
and
I
really
can't
recommend
them
highly
enough!
I
did
write
a
longer
review,
but
Trustpilot
made
me
go
to
another
page
to
click
terms
and
agreements
blahlblah
and
deleted
my
review.

So
to
sum
it
up,
Zavvi
is
a
great
site
with
excellent
prices,
particularly
on
Blu
Rays.

Delivery
is
always
quick,
items
well
packaged
and
I
would
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
the
site
to
anyone.
This
website
is
brilliant,
the
search
engine
and
filters
work
well
and
listening
to
music
on
the
virtual
deck
is
quick
and
intuitive.

The
variety
of
clothes
is
outstanding
and
there's
some
really
cool
stuff
available
that
you'll
struggle
to
get
elsewhere.

Delivery
is
also
really
fast
and
I've
never
had
any
problems
at
all.

Great
website!
Enormous
inventory,
They
always
make
things
right
for
the
customer.
I
shopped
around
and
found
some
cheaper
parts
on
other
sites
BUT,
the
shipping
was
way
too
much.
PartsGeek
had
all
my
parts,
and
shipping
was
almost
free
(8.95
compared
to
74.95).
I
will
continue
to
shop
at
PartsGeek
and
recommend
them
to
all
I
know.
I
have
used
My
Plumber
on
many
occasions
and
would
highly
recommend
them.
My
order
was
in
the
nature
of
a
test,
to
establish
whether
your
service
and
the
quality
of
your
work
would
be
suitable
for
further
work.
I
was
delighted
with
the
results.
My
only
reservation
with
one
of
my
four
images,
was
the
result
of
my
own
colour
correction
,
and
not
in
any
way
a
result
of
any
error
byPoint
101.
They
can
rely
on
future
business
from
me
and
further
endorsement.
pricing
per
text
is
higher
than
most,
but
then
if
you
want
a
useful
control
panel
then
this
is
acceptable.

A

of
the
items
on

are
a

outside

one
thing
is

-
its

that
you
are

for.
The
range
is
extensive
and
my
wish
list
is
long.
My
recent
purchase
of
several
items
went
very
smoothly
and
they
were
quickly
sent
and
well
packaged.
I
recently
bought
a
clamp
for
my
pearl
drum
rack.
We
are
now
deciding
where
to
hang
it
and
to
frame
it.
It
is
so
nice
but
I
should
have
taken
more
time
in
approval.

First
off,
I
got
what
I
ordered
so
that
was
good.
However,
I
had
to
call
after
1
week
from
placing
my
order
to
see
if
it
had
shipped
or
not,
and
was
told
it
was
shipping
that
day.
The
email
with
the
tracking
number
arrived
the
same
day
the
box
did.
The
box
had
been
shipped
4
days
prior,
but
the
tracking
number
email
was
delayed
4
days.
That's
my
only
complaint.
Purchased
four
new
tires
today,
the
Assistant
Manager
Andy
explained
all
of
the
options
available
and
was
prompt
and
courteous.
Thank
You,
will
refer
friends
and
relatives
to
make
future
purchases
at
your
store.
Not
once
have
I
been
dissatisfied
or
disappointed
with
anything
I
have
ordered
and
received
from
you.

When
I
shop
around
to
compare
prices,
more
often
than
not,
yours
is
the
best
with
the
best
quality
parts
too.

A
total
winner
for
me.
I've
only
been
playing
guitar
for
a
couple
of
years
and
like
most
beginners
have
struggled
with
some
of
the
elements
such
as
chord
changes
and
over
verb
when
playing
notes
quickly.
I
have
been
using
an
amp
I
bought
as
a
pack
which
cost
me
all
of
£50
including
a
stratt
copy
so
as
you
can
imagine
a
quality
item.
So
I
thought
that
all
thses
issues
where
just
me
and
spent
hours
trying
to
improve
my
technique,
then
for
my
birthday
I
was
bought
the
Marshall
MG15CFX
and
instanlty
improved
my
playing,
I
think
its
due
to
the
clarity
of
the
amp
you
don't
need
to
press
the
strings
down
as
hard
and
the
lighter
touch
improves
you
speed
across
the
fret
board.
This
has
made
a
massive
difference
to
me
and
feel
like
I
have
made
a
big
step
forward.
Great
sound,
great
effects
so
you
can
sound
more
like
the
track
you
are
learning.
Don't
underestimate
the
benefit
a
good
amp
can
make.
The
single
best
thing
I
have
done
so
far
was
wake
my
son
up
at
7
in
the
morning
(after
he
staggered
in
at
an
ungodly
hour)
and
played
stars
and
stripes
forever
on
full
with
full
overdrive...payback
class!

Got

Wanted
a
quality
garden
bench
without
the
price
tag
and
was
extremely
happy
with
the
bench
rom
Buttercup
Farm.
Very
swift
delivery
and
a
very
solid
well
built
bench.
It
required
minimal
assembly
and
went
together
easily
with
the
help
of
my
eight
year
old
grandson.
Due
to
the
green
residue
from
the
pressure
treatment
we
decided
to
add
further
treatment
with
a
Cedar
colour
garden
varnish
which
really
adds
to
the
appearance
of
the
bench.
Overall
very
pleased
with
the
bench.
Received
regular
email
updates
before
we
left
the
UK.
The
car
was
delivered
to
the
airport
on
time
with
a
free
upgrade
to
a
larger
more
comfortable
car.
Again
we
were
met
at
the
airport
on
time
to
hand
back
the
car.
A
first
class
service
which
we
would
use
again.
I
never
received
the
product

I
ordered.
I
have
tried
several
times
to
get
someone
at
Car
Part
Kings
but
without
success.
Every
email
and
a
voice
message
has
not
been
returned.
It
has
been
12
days
since
I
ordered
the
brake
caliper.
It
is
sitting
in
a
USPS
facility
in
Maryland
since
March
5th.
I
have
not
had
any
good
grievance
resolution
responses
from
this
vendor.
I
hope
to
hear
very
soon
after
this.
Call
me
direct
at
518-222-8713.
Shipping
is
always
fast
and
my
orders
have
always
been
correct.

You
can't
beat
the
prices
either.
I've
used
Metals4u
several
times.
The
stuff
I've
ordered
normally
arrives
next
working
day,
but
never
more
than
two
working
days.
It's
always
exactly
what
I
expected.
So

I
will
continue
to
use
them
as
my
first
choice
supplier
of
small
quantity,
quality
materials
for
my
home
Workshop.
I
have
used
twice
and
have
not
been
disappointed.
I
would
recommend
and
would
definitely
use
again.
From
start
to
finish
the
process
was
simple.

Designing
a
label
and
then
submitting
was
easy
and
enjoyable.
Lots
of
good
features
to
help
customize
your
product.

I
forget
to
fill
out
part
of
my
address
and
the
company
called
to
get
the
rest
of
my
info.

And,
the
labels
arrived
earlier
than
expected.

Great
company.
I
usually
buy
these
cards
at
the
local
store
and
they
are
just
regular
cards
so
frills.
Then
I
have
to
somehow
personalize
them
so
each
child
knows
who's
is
who's.
This
was
great
I
could
personalize
each
one
and
make
it
there
own.
Which
makes
it
a
nicer
gift
and
it
was
so
easy
to
do.
it
took
5
minutes
to
order
all
three.
Ordered
another
product
from
the
RapidNFC,
email
notification
arrived
to
say
expect
2
working
days,
package
arrived
the
next
day.
Love

I

The
bikes
themselves
are
great,
but

almost
two

to

despite
being
bought
from

If
you
need
medical

this
is
the
perfect
place
to
go

find
whatever
medical
supplies
you
need.
The
prices
are
reasonable
and

Where
have
you
been
all
my
life?
I
am
currently
going
through
another
opportunity
and
RCN
is
again
my
choice
to
do
business
with.

They
provide
opportunity
where
conventional
banks
would
not
even
give
you
a
chance.

Their
terms
are
reasonable
and
their
rates
are
fare.

The
terms
are
straight
forward
and
when
you
actually
do
call
or
email,
someone
answers
my
inquires
in
a
timely
manner.
I
would
not
hesitate
in
recommending
RCN
to
anyone
in
the
market
to
invest.
They
know
their
craft
and
carry
it
out
with
true
professionalism.
B&H
is
really
good
at
prices.

Also,
they
have
a
really
nice
selection
of
film
crap
and
chemicals.

That
said,
somethings
they
will
not
send
out
to
you
so
you
have
to
go
to
there
superstore
in
New
York.

If
you
find
something
that
you
have
to
order
online
because
you
teleportation
machine
broke
you
can
go
to
Adorama.

Also,
Adorama
usually
has
better
prices
on
those
items
anyway.
There
was
no
issues
looking
for
and
finding
the
unit
i
need.
The
prices
were
right
and
move
in
special
was
awesome.
I
will
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
looking
for
storage
needs.
B
&
H
is
a
valued
retailer
that
is
great
to
do
business
with.
Thats
why
I
keep
coming
back.
As
an
industry
professional
I
count
on
B&H
to
always
have
the
items
I
need
to
complete
my
shoots.

It's
great
to
have
a
resource
that
covers
the
spectrum....
The

is
always

when
you

Your
company
has
been
reliable
and
truly

since

began

from

almost
two
years
ago.
This
is
one
of
those
rare
times
when
a
web
site
is
all
good
news.

I
should
have
asked
for
advice
before
I
ordered
but
didn't.

Despite
this
treated
on
the
phone
in
helpful,
pleasant
way.

I
don't
write
reviews
as
a

but
I
can
really
recommend
this
firm.

If
in
the
slightest
doubt
talk
to
them
before
ordering,
lots
of
goodwill
and
very
helpful.

Thanks

Good
quality
blinds
and
good
service
The
web
site
the
ordering
and
the
delivery
service
was
good
all
round
I
had
a
part
broken
in
the
box.

I
emailed
the
problem
to
PartsGeek
and
they
got
back
to
me
fast.

No
problems.
With
my
crap
luck
with
tires,
I
need
this
place
more
than
I
want.
I'm
never
disappointed.
Nothing
more
to
say.
I
ordered
10
days
before
Christmas.
Supposedly,
there
was
a
six
to
ten
day
build
time,
three
day
shipping.
We
didn't
expect
it
before
Christmas,
but
on
January
5th
we
still
don't
have
it,
and
have
been
told
it
will
not
be
shipped
until
the
end
of
this
week
(January

10th).
I
have
used
bookbyte
multiple
times
to
not
only
sell
my
used
textbooks,
but
purchase
new
ones.
The
process
has
been
easy,
fast,
and
I
feel
like
I
get
the
best
use
out
of
my
money.
I
will
continue
to
use
them
while
I
am
in
school.
Like
most
people
I
checked
the
prices
if
my
product
on
several
sites
and
Dolphin
Fitness
was
the
cheapest.
Even
better
they
delivered
free.
And
even
better
they
gave
a
discount
for
a
large
order.
Delivery
both
ways
was
fast
and

The

locks
into

any

Do
not
count
on
it
if
you
have
a

door
(3.0').

If
you
do,
it
may
have
a
tendency
to
slightly
dent/damage
your

It
seems
to
handle
typical
width
doors
jus
fine.

However,
desperately
need
to
fix
your
inventory
system.
Probably
ordered
from
you
24
timed,
with
only
1/3
of
the
shipments
being
completely
filled.
Frustrating
for
a
collector,
asi
pass
opportunities
to
order
from
your
site
only
to
be
disappointed
when
item
never
arrived.
I
found
a
scratchy
not
in
my
letter
box
with
wrong
date
-
over
a
10
days
old
-
and
said
I
had
to
sign
for
my
delivery.
I
rang
up
the
delivery
company
and
said
i
could
leave
the
note,
sign
it
and
it
will
be
left.
I
live
in
a
busy
area
so
was
not
keen
to
have
box
left
at
front
door
-
i
had
to
drive
to
depot
to
pick
up
and
sign.
It
would
have
been
easier
for
box
to
be
sent
at
local
Post
Office
-
I
would
have
saved
45
minutes!
Not
sure
what
I'll
do
next
time???
I
had
multiple
methods
of
communicating
with
me
but
when
Target
had
their
seciurity
breached
BECU
automatically
re-issued
all
their
debit
cards.
It
was
that
BECU
credit
card
my
PS
bill
was
paid
with
automatically
but
it
didn't
go
through,
and
I
did
not
get
any
communication
regarding
the
issue
until
I
tried
to
get
into
my

and
was
locked
out.

Totally
bad

Call
me
next

I
really
enjoy
shopping
at

Besides
a
wide
range
of
products,
they
are
really
helpful
to
speak
with
over
the
phone
regarding
their
views/
opinions.
I
spoke
with
someone
regarding
a
gift
I
wanted
to
buy
for
my
dad,
and
he
was
very
pragmatic
(didn't
offer
the
most
expensive
product)
and
never
forced
me
to
buy.
I
eventually
ordered
online,
after
I
did
some
more
research.
The
order
was
delivered
very
promptly
and
in
mint
condition.
I
will
definitely
buy
again
from
them.
Nothing
but
positive
things
to
say.

It

following

PC
worked
from
the
start
and
is
super
quick
in
everything
it
does.

I
only
purchased
a
pc
at
the
bottom
end
of
Dino
PCs
range
with
a
couple
of
slight
upgrades.

Well
worth
the
money.

The
only
slight
niggle
is
that
there
is
no
instruction
booklet
and
whilst
I
have
a
little
knowledge
I
am
far
from
confident.

May
seem
stupid
but
there
are
two
buttons
on
the
front
of
the
PC,
one
is
obviously
the
power
on
button
but
as
yet
I
am
not
sure
what
the
other
does
and
don't
have
the
confidence
to
try
it.

Overall
really
glad
I
purchased
this
pc.

Make

ordered
an

offered
elsewhere
only
by
the
dealer
at
three
times
the
cost,
at
2
pm
and
received
the
part
by
UPS
at
1
pm
the
next
day.
Great

with
accurate
billing.
I
tried

directly
to
their

After
an
hour
of
waiting
and
numerous
tries
I
gave
up
and
placed
an
order
with
another
online
store.
Cult

This
site
is
excellent.
Fair
play
you
delivered
as
promised
and
you
spoke
to
me
and
kept
me
informed
all
the
way
well
done
cheers
Wayne.
Your
pricing
is
excellent
and
delivery
is
great.
However,
I
don't
believe
you'll
be
able
to
stay
in
business
for
a
long
time
unless
you
change
an
expensive
operation.
You
shipped
me
four
different
boxes
in
two
sizes
each
along
with
packing
material
for
product
that
could
have
easily
been
shipped
in
only
one
of
the
smaller
shipping
containers.
Therefore
you
wasted
the
material
cost
of
three
boxes
and
the
packing
plus
the
labor
cost
of
three
unnecessary
handlings.
I
really
hope
you
stay
in
business
and
if
your
operating
margins
are
good
with
your
current
practice,
then
maybe
you
should
up
your
margins
a
bit
and
lower
prices
so
we
can
both
win
at
you
becoming
more
efficient.
Thank
you.

Brilliant.

The
voiles
arrived
beautifully
packed
in
individual

with
the
measurements
on

which

they
are
for
so
the
'wash

can
be
put

tidily.
Also
I
had
requested
free

which
arrived
really
quickly

helped
my

I
preferred
to

Excellent,
brilliant,

Ordering
through

fast

efficient,
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend.
And
a
good
price
to
boot.
I
ordered
a

and
had
it
two
days
later.

Exactly
what
I
needed,
shipped

I
went
first
to

of
my
favorites
and
free

But
after

Hi
guys:
My
wife's
BMW
failed
to
start
about
a
month
ago
and
was
about
to
be
towed
by
the
vicious
landlord.
I
am
not
a
mechanic
but
I'm
a
good
troubleshooter
so
I
narrowed
the
problem
down
to
the
fuel
pump
and
started
looking
online.
I
checked
a
dozen
sites
and
selected
PartsGeek
for
its
huge
inventory
and
the
great
prices.
I
placed
the
order
and
had
dinner
with
my
family.
When
I
checked
a
little
later
the
parts
were
already
processed
and
shipped
which
was
amazing.
Anyway
got
all
the
parts
next
day
and
found
them
all
to
be
perfect
OEM's.
I
was
done
an
hour
before
the
tow
man
dead
line
and
connected
the
battery
charger/starter
and
turned
the
ignition
and
got
the
Bimmer
running
again.
Thanks
to
the
PartsGeek
for
an
outstanding
service.
I
highly
recommend
them.
The
service
was
great
but
the
winter
ball
I
ordered
was
leaking
in
the
package.
I
sent
clubs
in
a
soft
bag,
and
I
forgot
the
driver
tree,
and
thought
for
sure
it
would
be
snapped
off
at
the
head.

My
clubs
were
perfect!

Couldn't
be
happier!
I
originally

I

I
have
it

After
I
filled

realized
I
had

I
did

it

I

It's

box.
I
ordered
a
2008
Kia
Sportage
bumper
cover
in
March
and
did
not
realize
that
it
was
the
wrong
part
when
I
picked
it
up

on
March
25th
(it
was
for
a
friends
car)
When
I
went
to
work
with
the
part
I
realized
it
was
wrong
and
tried
to
contact
Partgeek
about
this,
email
only
and
upto
a
48
hour
response
time
(very
poor)
I
did
not
have
my
email
from
when
I
bought
the
part
but
I
am
sure
I
was
shipped
the
wrong
part,
I
was
told
in
a
response
email
that
I
had
waited
too
long
to
try
to
return
the
part
(April
15th)
and
that
I
had
to
keep
it.
In
the
mean
time
I
had
placed
another
order
with
Partsgeek
for
another
bumper
cover
to
replace
the
wrong
one
I
had
been
shipped.
I
replied
to
the
email
with
the
dates
that
I
had,
which
was
inside
the
30
day
return
policy,
2
days
later
I
received
another
email
that
my
order
would
be
returned
and
I
should
wait
for
an
email
with
return
instructions
(another
2
days)
My
SECOND
order
was
canceled
and
never
sent
and
I
am
still
stuck
with
the
$400
(including
delivery
cost)
wrong
part.
I
will
never
purchase
from
this
company
again
and
I
will
never
recommend
that
anyone
else
use
this
company
for
parts
I
found
the
entire
process
easy.
It
was
simple
to
put
it
into
the
categories
I
wanted
to
view
the
hotels
,
for
example
price.
The
whole
process
was
hassle
free
and
it
was
very
easy
to
save
a
hotel
and
come
back
later.
I
have
booked
a
hotel
in
Amsterdam
and
am
very
impressed
with
the
price
and
discount
offered.
Good
products
at
good
prices
with
good
delivery.
Ive
yet
to
find
anything
that
I've
wanted
that
they
dont
have.
I
find
that
the
inability
to
easily/quickly
change
inaccuracies
in
my
personal
data
to
be
VERY
frustrating
-
maybe
worth
trying
another
company.
Part
was
the
correct
part,fit
like
it
was
suppose
to!

Easy
ordering
process!
I
ordered
one
type
of
food
got
completely
different
food
and
it
came
2
days
late
past
day
they
said
it
would
be
here
and
left
on
porch
outside
when
I
said
leave
in
hall
..
It
says
"Write
as
if
you're
speaking
to
a
friend."
Well,
friend,
stop
dicking
with
code
that
works
just
fine
and
chill
on
the
couch
with
some
Doritos
and
a
DVD
of
Homeland.
You
keep
changing
the
interface.
Every
time
you
do
it
takes
more
clicks
to
do
the
same
thing
with
no
increased
functionality.
Also,
every
time
you
change
it,
you
introduce
new
bugs.
Not
only
that,
the
bugs
in
Firefox
are
different
from
the
bugs
in
Safari
which
are
different
from
the
bugs
in
Chrome.
So
now
when
I
post
something,
I
have
to
do
part
of
the
work
in
one
browser,
part
in
another
and
part
in
another.
If
I
resize
a
photo
in
Chrome
it
will
still
display
the
same
size
even
though
in
the
control
panel
it
*claims
to
now
be*
smaller,
or
larger.
I
can
fix
that
in
Google
Chrome,
where
resizing
the
photo
really
resizes
it,
but
then
all
the
paragraph
breaks
get
lost
and
the
text
is
run
together
as
one
giant
paragraph.
I
can
fix
*that*
in
Safari,
but
it
inserts
strange
code
right
into
the
text,
ampersands
and
semi-colons.
So
I
have
to
do
a
manual
cleanup
after
I
finish
writing.
Fairly
simple
to
compare/book.
When
we
get
there
at
the
crack
of
dawn
on
Sunday
the
single
PurpleParking
rep
was
very
stressed
and
the
queue
was
building
-
could've
been
slicker
there.
We
weren't
in
a
hurry
but
if
we
had
been
it
wouldve
been
a
pain.
Products
advertised
by
the
The
Hut
are
big
name
items
of
real
quality
and
at
bargain
prices.
I
also
give
their
emails
a
good
look
over
to
see
what
is
on
offer.
A
very
good
way
of
obtaining
a
good
whisky
that
isn't
easily
available
locally.
Decided
upon
purchase
of
Fender
Guitar
and
received
friendly
and
helpful
advice
by
employee
who
ensured
that
I
saved
money
and
got
an
outstanding
deal.
Really
pleased
with
the
service
I
received
-
100%
recommend
GAK
as
a
music
instrument
retailer!
This
is
a
one-stop
shop
for
the
best
supplements
and
foods
your
for
your
body.
I
heard
about
this
company
on
the
JRE
Podcast,
and
I'm
definitely
one
that
likes
to
see
the
research
that
goes
into
any
product
that
I
buy,
and
Onnit
delivers
that.
The
videos
that
are
associated
with
the
products
are
great
and
shows
how
involved
Onnit
is
with
each
of
their
products;
it's
not
all
about
profits
for
them.
We
have
been
ordering
from
Petflow
for
over
a
year
now
and
can
not
say
how
pleased
we
are.

From
the
wonderful
assortment
of
food
and
treats
to
the
customer
service
individuals
my
needs
are
met
in
a
professional
and
efficient
manner.

Prices
are
fair
and
similar
to
below

to
what
I
would
pay
in
my
pet
store.

Free
shipping
or
low
cost
make
it
even
more
appealing.
I
was
a
Chase
ID
member
for
the
last
9
years
and
their
service
was
not
that
bad,
until
I
researched
Identity
Guard
and
let
me
tell
you
something,
I
never
looked
back.
The
easy
understanding
on
every
section
on
their
website
to
speaking
to
a
live
person,
if
you
get
lost,
is
a
big
plus
for
me!
My
identity
is
important
to
me
and
Identity
Guard
makes
my
days
and
nights
more
peaceful.
Thanks!
I
saved
a
lot
of
money.
The
printer
itself
said
not
to
use
it
but
it
works
fine!
Great
labels,
printed
professionally
and
delivered
fast!
Gak
was
fantastic.

I
haven't
used
them
before,
but
reviews
were
good,
so
I
phoned
up
about
a
Laney
bass
amp.
They
done
me
a
great
deal
and
I
received
it
the
very
next
day.
Ashdown
Mini
bass
rig,
arrived
next
day,
free
delivery,
cheapest
online,
fantastic
quality
item,
Couldnt
be
any
better.
Highly
recommend
DV247.
The
part
I
bought
was
a
brand
new
part,
cheaper
than
a
rebuilt
part
and
no
core
charge.
Now
to
wait
and
see
how
it
holds
up.
With
free
shipping
and
no
core
charge
I
was
very
delighted
with
the
service.
Been
using
parts
geek
for
a
long
while
parts
are
amazing
and
parts
I
did
not
know
they
would
carry
and
prices
are
extra
ordinary
I
requested
for
my
tickets
to
be
left
at
the
Kissimmee
office,
this
was
confirmed.
On
collection
half
my
tickets
was
in
Kissimmee,
the
other
half
in
the
Orlando
office.
Not
a
very
good
service.
Let
yourself
down
badly
as
a
company.
Very
easy
to
use.
Print
out
a
slip
and
they
pick
up
at
your
door.
Golf
clubs
are
there
waiting
for
you
when
you
arrive.
First
pair
arrived
5
days
after
the
order
placed.
Pleasing.
Yeah
good
selection
and
at
a
competitive
price.
Will
order
again.
Easy
booking
and
good
service
in
my
experience
Very
good
-
was
impressed.
Shipping
was
very
fast
and
the
price
was
excellent.
Good
rates
and
quick
service
The
choice
of
goods
is
excellent
at
very
competitive
price.
Guter
service
und
Abwicklung
I
would
have
rated
this
as
five
star
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
fact
that,
when
the
parcel
arrived
in
Paphos,
Cyprus
my
daughter
received
a
telephone
call
saying
she
had
to
collect
it
from
the
depot.
Having
paid
for
door
to
door
service
this
seemed
unreasonable.
Having
explained
that
she
was
unfamiliar
with
Paphos
the
parcel
was
then
delivered
to
her
home,
so
this
seems
to
be
an
issue
with
the
Cyprus
agent.
I
still
feel
that
this
is
a
great
way
to
send
items
that
are
needed
quickly,
as
it
takes
a
minimum
of
eight
days
by
Royal
Mail
and
this
only
took
three
working
days.
I
found
this
policy
via
an
on-line
search.
The
cover
offered
was
competitive,
as
was
the
price,
and
the
application
process
was
very
straightforward.
The
policy
documents
were
delivered
very
quickly
by
email
and
I
now
have
peace
of
mind
that
I
have
cover
for
my
overseas
travel
for
the
next
twelve
months.
The
supply
of
products
was
quick
and
easy.
Not
sure
if
the
delivery
is
the
same
for
less
amounts
spent
as
this
is
my
first
order
with
bulk
powders.
Ordered
from
the
US
and
it
didn't
take
two
weeks
to
get
my
order!
Normally
from
the
UK
it
takes
forever
and
a
day
to
get
your
packages.

AND
I
thought
it
was
really
cool
that
they
included
a
little
chocolate
candy
in
the
box.
I
will
be
ordering
from
them
again
as
well
as
telling
my
family
and
friends
about
Cloud
9
Vaping!
I
had
ordered
some
decaffeinated
green
tea
extract,
500mg.

The
bottle
on
the
web
site
showed
500mg
when
enlarging
the
label.
So
I
ordered
it,
and
when
I
received
it,
it
was
100mg.

So
I
returned
and
as
of
today,
4/7/14
I
have
not
received
the
credit
back
to
my
charge
card.

So
again,
I
just
thought
it
was
a
mistake
and
ordered
it
again.

And
again
I
received
it
and
it
was
100mg
and
not
500mg.

So
this
time
I
called
in
and
the
lady
I
spoke
with
came
back
and
said
they
do
not
have
this
brand
in
500mg
anymore.

I
told
her
she
then
needs
to
make
the
correction
on
the
web
site.

She
said
she
would
have
to
have
that
done.

She
said
she
would
post
an
immediate
credit
to
the
credit
card
and
return
a
postage
paid
label
to
me.

Have
not
received
this
year
either.

So
then
I
asked
her
what
brand
could
I
get
this
in
500mg.

She
told
me
Jarrow.

So
I
went
on
your
web
site
again
to
order
this
and
it
said
it
was
out
of
stock.

So,
I
ordered
a
different
brand
in
750
mg,
and
will
take
this
twice
a
day.

My
Dr.
wanted
me
to
take
500mg
3
times
a
day.

Hopefully
you
will
get
back
the
500mg
supply
which
I
had
ordered
from
you
for
the
last
2
years.

Thanks.
Fast,
secure
and
accurate.
Doesn't
get
better
than
this.
I
appreciate
that
I
can
get
a
credit
for
my
balance
due
with
Pitney-Bowes.
Price
is
always
very
competitive,
shipping
is
always
fast
I
recently
recv'd
a
new
shower
seat
for
my
remodeled
master
bath.
When
it
arrived,
I
was
very
happy
to
see
and
feel
the
quality
of
the
seat.
It
was
very
evident.
This
shower
seat
has
teak
slats
to
sit
on
and
are
so
smooth
and
sturdy
they
must
be
comfortable.
It
folds
up
to
be
out
of
the
way
when
not
in
use.
It
also
seems
like
it
will
last
a
very
long
time.
We
won't
be
able
to
use
it
for
about
another
week
or
so
when
all
the
construction
is
complete.
It
will
be
a
nice
addition
to
our
new
shower.
Really
impressed
by
the
range
and
value
compared
to
other
online
companies.

The
photos
are
really
well
presented
so
you
know
exactly
what
you
are
getting.

A
free
card
is
a
nice
touch
and
free
delivery
at
the
weekend
is
even
better.
I
was
very
happy
to
receive
my
RAB
summit
jacket
from
the
outdoor
shop,
but
when
it
arrived
it
looked
grubby/dirty.
I
phoned
the
shop
immediately
to
inform
them
and
they
said
that
it
may
be
the
down
feathers
showing
through
the
jacket.
Fair
enough,
but
a
little
strange
that
no
one
noticed
before
sending
it
out.
Anyway,
arranged
to
return
the
item
in
exchange
for
a
replacement
(different
colour)
and
was
told
that
this
would
be
a
'goodwill
gesture'
and
that
I
would
not
get
a
refund
on
my
postage.
As
the
jacket
was
worth
£190
I
had
to
send
it
special
delivery
at
a
cost
of
£10!
The
new
jacket
has
arrived
and
I
am
pleased
with
it,
although
I
have
a
bit
of
a
sour
taste
in
my
mouth
that
they
sent
me
a
substandard
item
to
start
with
then
I
had
to
fork
out
to
send
it
back
and
get
it
changed.
Promised
next
day
delivery
but
did
not
get
delivered
next
day!
Waited
in
especially!
When
item
was
received
the
postage
label
revealed
that
it
wasn't
even
posted
for
next
day
delivery.
I
even
emailed
to
ask
and
was
told
'Hi,
The
cartriges
looked
similar,
however
when
placed
in
my
printer
they
failed,
and
it
only
printed
in
B&W.
I
emailed
them
my
problem
and
no
solution
offered.
I'm
sending
them
back
and
getting
refund
I
have
used
Travelocity
for
years
and
it
has
never
disappointed!
Save
money
and
fit
replacement
part
instead
of
trying
to
find
a
shower
that
fits
over
pipes
wires
and
any
missing
tiles
you
don't
need
to
re
tile
which
you
might
have
to
do
with
new
shower
I
have
been
a
customer
of
Onnit.com
for
a
couple
years
now.
Where
I
used
to
go
seek
supplements
and
workout
equipment
individually
online,
I
now
have
almost
one
stop
shopping!
I
trust
the
quality
of
ingredients
in
their
supplements
and
the
durability
of
their
workout
equipment.

The
shipping
consistently
arrives
on
time
and
the
prices
aren't
too
bad.
I
found
out
about
Onnit.com
from
the
Joe
Roman
Experience
Podcast
originally
and
now
am
a
huge
fan
of
Aubrey
and
what
he's
done
with
this
company!
Thanks
guys!
Great
product.
Shipping
comes
on
time.
Love
ordering
from
them.
I
have
been
using
multiple
products
from
Onnit
for
years
and
couldn't
be
happier.
They
are
a
great
company
and
I'm
lucky
I
found
out
about
them
from
Joe
Rogan.
Easy
as
pie.

Quick
way
to
satisfy
the
mad
rush
to
buy
gifts
for
a
large
family
with
a
personnal
touch.
Really
happy
with
the
facebook
likes
coming
through!
Our
page
is
growing
with
many
new
student
attending
classes!
Thank
you
Sam
and
Team
for
a
amazing
job!
:)
Very
impressed
as
the
tags
arrived
on
time
and
was
exactly
what
I
wanted.
I
purchased
the
Fire
Emblem
Awakening
Limited
Edition
3DSXL
bundle,
the
abundant
information
on
the
respective
pages
were
a
great
resource,
assuring
me
of
a
good
purchase.
Ordered
a
Verizon
iPad
and
received
an
AT&T
iPad.
When
I
called
I
was
informed
that
they
were
out
of
the
Verizon
version
and
had
upgraded
me,
at
no
cost
to
me
as
a
courtesy,
to
the
AT&T
version
which
is
normally
more
expensive.
I
called
and
after
explaining
that
I
just
needed
to
get
an
AT&T
plan
for
the
iPad
the
representative
agreed
to
issue
and
RMA
but
I
would
have
to
pay
to
ship
the
iPad
back
to
them.
When
I
pushed
the
issue
that
I
didn't
order
the
wrong
item
and
they
substituted
something
without
asking
me
first
the
CSR
said
they
couldn't
issue
a
return
label
but
he
could
send
me
a
screen
protector.
We
finally
arrived
at
the
company
sending
me
a
mailing
label.
They
ultimately
resolved
the
issue
(actually
waiting
on
them
to
send
me
the
replacement/more
expensive
iPad)
but
it
shouldn't
have
taken
as
much
time
or
effort
to
get
it
resolved.
However,
at
the
end
of
the
day
all
of
the
reps
were
friendly
and
did
seem
to
care
about
customer
service
so
I
will
definitely
shop
from
them
again.
Great
service.
Got
my
order
quickly.
Would
definitey
shop
here
again.
We
used
insureand
Go
on
our
last
cruise

YAY!
As

First

Full
marks
for
prompt
delivery
and
product
satisfaction.
Great
speedy
service
with
hard
to
beat
pricing
My
parts
were
easy
to
pick
out,
it
was
easy
to
navigate
through
the
website
and
everything
came
on
time.
Easy,
quick,
solid.
Always
the
best
and
always
easy
to
work
with.
shipped
at
the
right
time
and
wasnt
damaged.
In
the
world
of
web
hosting,
no
news
is
good
news.
In
the
couple
of
years
since
our
website
has
been
hosted
with
Tsohost,
we
have
experienced
a
reliable
service.
Our
needs
are
modest
in
terms
of
users
and
thus
our
shared
hosting
package
is
not
going
to
set
the
world
alight,
but
we
have
had
consistent
performance
and
hardly
any
downtime.
I
got
the
part
I
ordered,
at
a
good
price.
And
I
received
it
quickly.
I
would
definitely
do
business
with
PartsGeek
again.
Fast
and
good
shopping.
Great
service.
Part
as
advertized.
Wish
they
had
brick
and
mortar
still.
They
gave
great
product
and
service.
First
Time
Ordering
excellente
service
and
products
!
no
problems
just
a
good
product
will
continue
to
use
as
long
as
price
remains
competitive
I
got
Black
Diamond
Guide
gloves
for
Christmas.
So
far,
so
good
-
great
gloves.
But,
they
don't
have
leashes.
So,
they
are
guaranteed
to
fall
and
get
lost
when
you're
on
the
lift
at
the
most
remote
spot.
I
needed
leashes
-
Hestra's
cuffs
are
the
best
but
try
buying
them
without
the
gloves.
No
problem
if
you
go
to
Tahoe
Mountain
Sports.
Now...the
best
gloves
and
the
best
leashes
-
I
need
a
new
excuse.
I
was
lucky
to
have
a
very
friendly
chap
named
Barry
assigned
to
me,
who
went
out
of
his
way
to
make
sure
that
I
received
the
best
possible
deal.
He
was
persistent
in
continuously
calling
me
to
understand
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for
and
give
me
my
best
options.
He
also
had
personal
contacts
in
the
industry
which
was
extremely
helpful,
as
he
helped
turn
what
would
have
been
a
long
gruelling
stop
over
in
India
into
an
experience
I'm
now
quite
looking
forward
to.
I
will
recommend
this
company
and
this
individual
to
my
friends
and
family.
Thanks
again
for
all
the
help.
Admittedly
this
was
the
first
piece
of
clothing
I
have
bought
online.
The
product
was
very
well
priced,
promptly
arrived,
and
fitted
perfectly
to
description.
Very
happy
with
the
result!
I
ordered
B&H
is
great
to
order
from.

Good
website.

Easy
ordering.

Quick
service.
Never
had
a
problem,
love
this

I
have

my

Despite
the
cold
wintery
rain,
we
still
took
to
the
open
top
part
of
the
Bus.
Our
guide
was
Jess,
very
informative,
humourous
and
huge
character
gave
us
some
warmth.
He
even
issued
us
with
rain
covers,
free
of
charge
(there
was
a
pleasant
surprise),
and
he
entertained
us
throughout
the
journey,
we
were
saddened
when
our
bus
and
guide
were
terminated
at
the
Ritz,
i
suppose
there
could
have
been
worse
places
to
be
terminated!
Web
site
was
easy
to
use,
and
very
informative.
Purchase
on
line
straight
forward.
Had
informative
emails
to
confirm
order,
order
picking
and
despatched.
Great
company
to
deal
with,
great
website
and
good
communication.
Found
the
website
easy
to
use,
simplistic
and
straightforward,
real
time
availabilty,huge
selection
to
choose
from!
Purchase
was
delivered
as
expected.

All
was
acceptable.
I
shopped
around
and
found
that
DoItYourselfLettering.com
had
the
best
website
for
creating
graphics.

Their
prices
were
about
half
of
some
of
the
other
sites.

They
shipped
my
order
quickly
and
accurately,
and
their
product
was
100%
as
expected.

It
was
easy
to
install
and
it
looks
great.
The
shoji
screen
doors
(4)
came
in
a
bullet
proof
shipping
crate.

The
rice
paper
with
the
vinyl
backing
adds
a
touch
of
grandure
to
the
mahogany
doors.

I
added
a
mahogany
veneer
to
the
inside
of
my
painted
trim
that
matched
the
doors.

It
gave
a
nice
finished
look.

Installation
was
a
snap.

Great
product
produced
by
a
quality
company.
Purchase
was
very
fast
and
rcv
in
order,
but
one
part
was
wrong.
Excellent
service.

Quick
payment
I
waited
almost
2
weeks
for
my
free
shipping
of
the
parts
and
when
they
finaly
came
one
of
the
boxes
was
riped
open
and
one
of
the
items
that
I
ordered
had
2
of
the
nuts
missing

I
had
spare
nuts
from
the
old
part
so
I
could
finish
the
job
I
will
never
order

from

Using
your
high
street
bank
to
transfer
your

This

The
hot

in

only
heat

Ordered
the

It
was

at
a

was
the
correct

and
resolved

A

good

The
ordering
process
could
not
have
been
easier.
The
delivery
was
within
a
few
working
days.
Great
service
Yes
its
true,
it
was
so
easy.
Simply
looked
up
on
the
web
site,
as
recommended
by
the
Which
magazine
and
got
the
best
price
possible.
I
found
what
I
was
looking
for
very
easy.
I
also
found
that
there
prices
were
very
good..The
check
out
and
complete
process
was
easy.
I
placed
an
order
online
for
a
pair
of
raybans.
My
frames
got
placed
on
back
order,
and
they
notified
me
almost
a
full
week
later.

So
whatever.
picked
a
new
pair
of
frames,
and
then
second
pair
of
frames
were
placed
on
back
order.


So
I
wound
up
going
back
to
the
original
pair
and
waited
well
over
a
month
after
I
had
finally
received
my
glasses.

The
ladies
at
customer
service
are
dolls,
but
there's
no
sense
of
urgency
with
the
customer
or
effort
to
credit
the
customer
for
the
inconvienance.
Good
product
but
delivery
was
a
little
slow
as
it
was
despatched
from
Hong
Kong.
This
is
the
second
lens
I've
bought
from
Park
and
in
both
cases
the
service
was
excellent
-
the
ordering
process
was
smooth
and
simple
to
complete.

Delivery
was
on
time.
Would
definitely
order
again.
I
ordered
a
ps3
and
was
notified
as
soon
as
it
was
dispatched,
then
again
notified
of
the
time
and
day
that
the
delivery
would
be
made.
Plus
the
delivery
was
free!
Overall
a
hassle
free,
easy
company
to
use.
What
more
could
you
ask
for.
No
need

I
explained
it
all
above

Pickup
was
one
day
late.
PRICES
R
GREAT,
&
DELIVERY
WAS
PROMPT
!!!
Everything
in
one
easy
step.
Have
used
Travelocity
before
and
feel
very
good
about
my
experience.
Just
as
advertised!

The
product
was
easy
to
order
and
came
within
a
couple
days!
I
have
always
recommended
B
and
H
to
colleagues
and
add
that
customer
services
is
always
on
hand.
Cheaper
price
than
what
was
available
on
the
Eurostar
website.
Also
faster,
easier-to-use
interface.
Perfect!
I
found
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for.
That's
always
a
good
thing.
Quick
and
helpful
service.
Order
was
shipped
very
quickly
as
well.
Product
seems
good.
Great
review.
The
entire
team
at
Frooition
are
the
most
helpful
in
start
to
finish
marketing
solutions.
At
every
step
of
the
way
they
are
totally
responsive
in
answering
all
questions
in
a
timely
manner.
Concept
to
completion
with
open
communication.
An
absolute
perfect
10
out
of
10
in
our
eyes.
Prompt
order
acknowledgement
&
delivery.
First
class
service.
Very
pleased
with
the
lettering
we
ordered.
Easy
to
use
and
looks
great!
I
needed
a
tool
to
remove
the
oil
filter
cartridge
from
my
BMW-Z4.
I
got
my

in
2
days.

Rock!!
I
liked
what
I
saw.
I
have
been
at
AEC
since
1997.

Currently
I
use
the
Virtual
Office
program.

From
1997
until
2011
I
was
a
tentant
at
the
KOP
Office.

My
experience
with
the
KOP
Staff
has
been
exceptional.

Whatever
I
needed
they
were
always
able
to
accomodate
me.
The
parts
that
I
ordered
came
on
time.
I
would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
that
is
looking
to
buy
auto-parts
Perfectly
professional
from
order
to
delivery.
Definitely
would
award
this
company
an
'A-
Star'
for
efficiency,
quality
and
overall
value.
Excellent,
excellent,
excellent
-
I'm
truly
pleased
with
the
product
and
service.
From
beginning
to
the
end
my
retail
experience
has
been
positive
one
and
I
would
/
have
recommended
'Country
Attire'
to
my
friends
and
family
or
to
anyone
who
appreciates
a
professional,
courteous
shopping
experience!
1
day
delivery,
quality
good.
Need
I
say
more?
Will
use
again
in
future
most
likely.
ordered
my
goods
on
sunday
evening
and
received
wednesday
morning.very
happy
with
service
and
goods
.will
shop
here
again
in
the
near
future
and
have
told
people
about
the
good
service.
I
have
used
a
lot
of
booking
sites
but
this
is
by
far
the
easiest.

It
gives
you
options
to
open
other
browsers
to
compare
similar
to
kayak
but
you
don't
have
to
because
they
bring
up
all
the
prices
regardless,
unlike
kayak.

I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
We
have
order
multiple
time
from
British
Corner
Shop!
Every
time
the
orders
are
superbly
packed!
The
prices
are
great
too!
We
live
in
the
USA
and
can't
get
99%
of
the
stuff
here.
The
tea
for
one
tastes
much
better
than
the
"gourmet"
stuff
we
have
here!
The
snacks
and
seasoning
are
amazing.
Even
if
there
is
an
issue
they
are
in
constant
communication
every
step
of
the
way.
If
something
broke
or
missing
or
what
ever
the
case
just
contact
them!
Their
kind
and
helpful
staff
will
immediately
get
the
ball
going
for
replacent
or
refunds.
I'd
recommended
then
to
anyone
whether
state
side
in
the
uk
or
other
country!
I'll
be
a
life
long
customer!
I
know
I
haven't
shopped
here
in
a
while,
but
I
guess
I'll
just
take
them
out
completely
and
unsubscribe
to
email.

My
order
had
everything
price
reduced
to
beat
out
some
other
websites
and
so
I
placed
it.

Received
confirmation
email
with
lowered
total
and
then
see
the
next
day
a
higher
total
is
taken
out
from
them.

No
email
or
heads
up,
so
canceled
my
order.

From
the
total
I
think
I'll
just
stick
with
my
previous
supplier
from
the
last
time
I
reviewed
who
also
has
a
flat
rate
shipping
of
$5.95.
The
staff
has
been
helpful
and
friendly
and
professional.
Very
nice
and
convenient
I
am
always
impressed
by
the
speed
of
delivery
and
have
always
gotten
what
I
ordered.
I
can
only
say
good
things
about
this
site.
The
hoodie
is
soooooooo
fluffy...I
had
to
get
one
when
my
friend
showed
me.
The
white
one
looks
the
sickest
to
me
so
I
got
that
one.
I
will
definitely
shop
here
again!
I
have
ordered
a
lot
of
products
from
Royal
Shave
and
I
have
never
been
disappointed!
They
are
fast
convienent
and
a
great
value.
PART
FIT
PERFECTLY
AND
WAS
BETTER
QUALITY
THAN
EXPECTED!!!
I
had
no
idea
who
made
the
shower
-
sent
some
photos
to
The
Shower
Doctor.
They
were
able
to
identify
the
shower
make,
part
and
price
very
quickly.
I
placed
an
order
and
received
the
parts
by
royal
mail.
Installed
and
shower
back
in
action
within
two
days.
A
fantastic
business
model.
Well
done!
Absolutely
love
this
site!
It
will
take
the
work
out
of
trying
to
compare
prices
and
rates
on
all
your
travel
needs.
After
being
introduced
by
B
and
H
Photovideo
store
by
them
sending
me
a
catalog
I
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
store
ever
since.
This
store
offers
the
largest
range
of
products
and
by
far
and
a
way
the
most
detailed
product
descriptions
and
specifications
that
the
manufacture
gives
but,
here
you
are
given
the
information
and
you
don't
have
to
do
any
real
research
on
details.
if
you
have
any
questions
or
concern
give
them
and
email
and
you
will
be
given
with
an
update
or
response
within
twenty
four
hours
of
a
business
day.
ordering
on-line
is
simple,
yet
complete
with
all
of
the
information
that
you
need
to
know.
this
is
the
best
store
i
have
ever
bought
items
from
and
highly
recommended
it.
Great
job,
good
price,
shipping
too
high
I
have
ordered
lenses
over
a
week
ago
and
as
yet
have
not
received
them,
tried
to
get
customer
service
on
your
website
but
none
was
found
(Big
Surprise)
I
have
purchased
twice
from
this
company
and
now
will
never
again
shop
there.
After
my
order
was
totaled
it
qualified
for
free
delivery,
but
due
to
going
out
f
town
the
following
week
I
opted
to
pay
for
a
two
day
air.
I
received
an
email
about
my
order
shortly
after
paying
and
it
issued
me
a
tracking
number.
Stating
that
it
was
already
on
the
way.
I
looked
at
the
tracking
number
for
FedEx
and
it
was
schedule
to
be
delivered
on
the
2nd
day
which
is
what
I
paid
for.
Then
the
next
day
I
just
checked
again
to
ensure
all
was
on
schedule
and
to
my
surprise
it
changed.
Now
the
delivery
was
changed
to
the
following
week
on
a
Monday.

Since
I
would
be
out
of
town
I
was
very
upset
so
upset
in
fact
I
emailed
customer
support
explaining
my
situation
and
why
I
was
upset.
All
I
got
back
was
an
I'm
sorry
and
here
is
our
shipping
policy.
Oh
and


We
might
need
to
make
this
more
clear
as
you
are
not
the
only
one
that
has
had
this
complaint.
So
basically
I
feel
I
paid
15
dollars
for
shipping
when
I
didn't
need
to
and
customer
service
did
not
care.
Oh
well
their
loss
I
will
be
more
than
happy
to
take
my
business
elsewhere
and
never
refer
them
again.
Ordered
part
and
was
delivered
fast.Locksmith
asked
me
how
much
i
paid
for
the
part,and
i
told
him.He
pays
more
with
someone
else,now
he's
gonna
check
out
partsgeek.
I
have
been
using
Priceline
for
more
than
10
years
to
get
the
best
hotel
deals
on
the
Web.
I
have
no
complaints
so
far
and
will
continue
to
use
Priceline
for
the
forseeable
future.
The
only
disadvantage
that
I
have
seen
so
far
is
the
lack
of
options
for
selecting
a
hotel
with
certain
features
that
may
sometimes
be
important
for
me
-
such
as
free
breakfast,
free
parking,
close
to
the
bus-stop,
having
a
kitchen,
etc.
But
in
most
cases,
the
selection
works
out
wonderfully
even
without
having
to
mention
these
options.
I
wouldn't
order
anything
from
them

without

I
found
the
part
I
was
looking
for
really
quick.
I
needed
a
lug
nut
for
my
2001
Jeep
Cherokee.

I
found
exactly
what
I
wanted
and
placed
an
order
for
six
lug
nuts...got
some
spares.

The
website
was
easy
to
maneuver
and
feedback
was
excellent
once
the
order
was
placed.

I
received
the
parts
earlier
than
anticipated.

All
in
all
my
expectations
were
exceeded.
Very
pleased
with
the
service.
New

I
got

in
2/3
days
but
when
I
installed
it
in
my
printer
the
next
day
the
printer
wasn't
printing
anything
so
I
cleaned
the
print
head
over
and
over
wasting
a
lot
of
time.
Finally,
I
changed
the
ink
again
and
the
printer
started
printing
with
no
problems!!!
This
was
a
quick
and
straightforward
purchase.
Would

They

the

I
called
their

told
them

Most
come
in
right.
Most
of
the
parts
Iv'e
ordered
from
you
guys
have
been
right.
But
resently
you
charged
me
a

for
a
return
that
I
belive
was
not
my
fault.
I
asked

ordered
a

The
picture
didn'T
look
right
but
most
weeb
sites
say
picture
doesn't
represent
actual
part.
So
I
orderded
and
it
was
nothing
like
my
blower,
not
even
close.
Was
that
my
fault?
I
order
a
lot
of
parts

so
you
tell
me,
was
that
fair?
Sent

minutes

got

It

didn't

trying

has
improved

She
no

to

Her

means
so

Could

TSO
Host
are
without

an
extremely
valuable
external
member
of
my
team,
assisting
with
the
best
solutions
and
support
I've
seen
from
any
competitors
I've
used
in
the
past
-
I'd
strongly
recommend
these
guys
for
anyone
looking
for
a
team
who
can
give
you
a
range
of
solutions
and
fantastic
support.
Given
how
good
Dive
Right
In
Scuba's
prices
are
you'd
expect
there
to
either
be
poor
customer
service,
poor
return
polices,
slow
and
high
priced
shipping,
or
just
a
bad
selection.

None
of
them
apply.

You
can
talk
to
the
owners
easily,
the
customer
service
is
fast
and
without
issues,
the
price
matching
policy
is
almost
too
good
to
be
true,
they
ship
quickly,
and
if
the
shipping
price
turns
out
to
be
less
than
what
the
actual
cost
was
they
only
charge
you
the
actual
price.

I
try
to
buy

here

else.
Great

Thanks

Love
the

and

was
super
fast
I
would
recommend
all
of

products
to
my
family
and
fiends,
And
have
done
so.

I
started
with
their
AlphaBrain

ShroomTech

now
have
added

make

I
honestly
feel
as
if
my
body
and
mind
are
running
more
effectively.

Try
it
if
you
have
not!
I've
bought
quite
a
few
deals
over
the
past
months,
the
vast
majority
of
which
have
been
excellent.
When
there
was
a
problem,
concerning
a
restaurant
deal

that
was
advertised
for
two
people
but
which
was
only
for
one,
this
was
sorted
very
quickly
and
a
refund
was
immediately
paid!
I
needed
an
unusual
part
and
could
not
find
it
anywhere
on
the
web
but
because
your
web
site
had
pictures,
I
was
able
to
purchase
a
part
for
a
similar
same-make
vehicle
for
the
same
year
and
exchange
working
piece
with
my
old
part.
Worked
well.

I
needed
a
part
for
my
car.

In
checking
with
several
mechanics,
I
found
the
prices
really
high.

So
I
checked
on
the
internet
and
found
Parts
Geek.

The
price
for
my
part
was
at
least
60%
lower!

Delivery
was
free
and
no
tax!

The
part
fit
perfectly.
This
place
is
GREAT!!!

now
but
never
found
it

cheap
as
this
anywhere!

I
was
even
more
impressed
with
the
speed
of
delivery,
the
item
arrived,
well
packaged,
within
48
hours
of
placing
the

Will
definitely
use
this

I
was
unfortunate
to
have
my
car
vandalized
outside
my
house,
so
I
needed
a
mobile
tyre
fitter
because
I
couldn't
move
the
car.
After
getting
lots
of
quotes
from
local
companies
Kwik
Fit
beat
all
of
them,
one
by
over
£60.
I
have
never
used
Kwik
Fit
before
as
I
always
wrongly
assumed
that
they
were
expensive,

the
service
I
received
and
the
price
I
paid
were
excellent
and
I
would
recommend
Kwik
Fit
to
anyone.
I
buy
a
lot
of
'stuff'
online
and
usually
find
service
adequate
or
better.

However
buying
a
replacement
grille
for
my
newly
purchased
2004
Ford
Excursion
was
both
scary
and
rewarding.

The
scary
part
is
making
certain
I
have
the
correct
part
-
paying
to
ship
things
back
and
forth
is
expensive
and
wastes
time.

The
rewarding
part
was
PartsGeek.
Every
time
that
I
order
from
them
my
cat's
food
gets
here
so
FAST!
Sometimes
get
confused
on
why
fedex
is
knocking
at
my
door
because
I
feel
like
I
just
placed
the
order
and
shouldn't
expect
the
delivery
for
a
few
days.
Always
a
good
experience!
I
will
definitely
order
from
them
again.
They're
quick
and
their
prices
are
great.
I
bought
a
$25
League
of
Legends
prepaid
card!
I
went
to
redeem
this
card
and
got
a

4002:
Card
Is
Deactive
(The
same
error
given
if
the
card
was
stolen
and
was
not
activated
at
the
register)
I
talked
to
a
support
representative
and
a
refund
was
given.
Overall
this
was
a
bad
experience
and
I
don't
believe
i'll
do
doing
business
with
this
website
again.

Only
gripe,
Alamo
were
unable
to
honour
the

not
really
an
issue
as
a
reasonable
alternative
was
instantly
made

only

so
in
many
respects
made
up
for
it
on
this

We
booked
with
Alpharooms
because
we
wanted
to
find
a
holiday
the
was
affordable
and
stress
free,and
that's

Service
was

by

I
very

enjoyed
this

I
had
spent
the
entire

calling
around
different
storage
units,
but
was
having
very
little
success.

This

compared
them
for

and
showed
the

I
got
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for
at
cheaper
than
I
expected.
Having
used
your
retail
outlet
on
a
number
of
occasions,
including
the
time
when
you
still
had
the
Soutgate

I
can
find

I
can
confidently
say
that
Ancestry
is
THE
resource
for
genealogical
research.
With
as
little
as
a

an

can

They

I
have
found
and
if
you
do
just
enter
that
company
and
what
they
are
asking
and
BOOM
5%
off.

cannot
beat
it
i
was
on
the
internet
practically
all
day
so
I
was
very
happy
to
find
this
method
to
book
our
hotel
stay
in
Miami.

I
will
recommend
this
site
to
all
my
family
and
friends
so
they
can
enjoy
these
benefits
too.
still
haven't
received
my
parts
ordered
about
a
week
ago
Your
site
stated
free
shipping
with
a
purchase
of
$49
or
more.

I
was
still
being
charged
shipping
in
checkout
so
reduced
my
order
size
which
was
unfortunate
as
a
loss
for
both
of
us.
ALL
OF
MY
PARTS
WERE
DELIVERED
ON
TIME


ALL
PARTS
FIT
TO
ORDER
Have
purchased
several
items
from
Dyers
and
have
found
the
selection
excellent
to
chose
from
and
service
and
speed
of
delivery
exceptional.
THE
ITEM
ARRIVED
SUPER
FAST,
WAS
AS
DESCRIBED,
QUALITY
AS
GOOD
AS
O.E.M.
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
INSTALLATION,
EVERYTHING
WORKED
AS

SHOULD......WILL
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND,
AND
WILL
DO
BUSINESS
AGAIN!
I
recently
went
to
the
townfair
tire
in
Saugus
MA
and
purchased
wheels
and
tires.
I
went
in
knowing
that
fitting
the
bolt
pattern
I
needed
was
tough
with
the
style
and
type
of
wheels
and
tires
I
wanted.
Their
employees
were
extremely
helpful
and
after
talkin
to
them
for
about
30
minutes
they
got
back
to
me
the
next
day
with
a
wheel
that
was
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for.
I
could
not
be
happier
with
the
service
and
professionalism.
Especially
with
the
tech
that
helped
me,
Anthony.
Bought
my
second
car
from
Drive
Time
great
service
love
the
car!
the
above
is
enough
I
ordered
the
same
type
of
product
on
two
occasions.
Neither
was
compatible
with
my
notebook
computer.
I
returned
both
and
was
promptly
refunded.
Excellent
service.
I
have
ordered
several
times
in
the
past
and
at
all
times
goods
were
delivered
promptly
The
price
on
the
part
I
needed
was
good.
They
were
fast
on
getting
it
shipped
and
only
took
two
days
to
get
to
me
after
I
ordered
it.
I
will
be
using
them
for
all
my
part
needs
from
now
on.

was
to
be
confirmed
for

it
was
booked
for
the
Airport
location.

I
checked
my
email
while
the

was
online
and
confirmed

he
had
the
wrong

He
assured
me
he
called
the
correct
location
to
resolve
the
matter..He
did
not..I
cancelled
everything
and
booked
with
hotels.com.
I
have
ordered
from
B&H
over
many
years
and
they
always
are
helpful
and
expedite
the
orders
quickly.

They
have
earned
my
trust!

Cannot
say
for
most
other
vendors.

is
a

Cult
pens
has
an
extensive
selection
of
refills
for
a
range
of
different
types
of
pens.

It
was
particularly
useful
to
find
recommendations
for
ballpoints
that
are
no
longer
made.
I
can
keep
an
old
PaperMate
going
for
much
longer
as
a
result.
I
recently
bought
glasses
for
the
first
time
through
internet.
The
experience
was
great
as
I
got
my
glasses
and
they
fitted
perfectly.
I
have
done
a
little
bit
of
research
on
size
and
brand
first
and
then
found
a
great
price
thru
SelecSpecs.com
The
glasses
were
shipped
overseas
and
I
got
them
in
10
days
which
I
thought
was
a
great
lead
time.
The
process
to
get
my
prescriptions
glasses
was
easy
and
it
worked.
I
have
no
regrets.
You
know
I've
been
looking
for
the
correct
Rim
for
My
Wife's
79
450
SL,
well
finally
I
found
a
place
who
sells
everything
under
the
Sun
for
the
Mercedes,
All
Mercedes.
I
ordered
what
I
thought
to
be
the
correct
Rim,
but
one
of
Adsit's
Staff
caught
a
problem
and
called
me
to
make
an
adjustment
in
the
order.
Sure
enough
the
Rim
I
order
would
not
have
fit.
Thanks
to
the
Staff
for
catching
the
mistake
and
sending
me
the
correct
item.
Next
time
your
looking
for
a
Part
on
your
Mercedes,
give
them
a
call,
you'll
be
happy
you
did.
It
did
take
a
lot
longer
than
I
liked
to
get
my
glasses.
I
was
told
that
was
Oakley's
fault
which
I
was
OK
with.
When
I
received
my
glasses
the
zipper
on
the
case
was
broken.
It
took
about
2
weeks
to
get
the
replacement.
During
that
time
his
glasses
and
frames
got
scratched.

The
biggest
problem
in
the
future
is
that
we
play
every
weekend
and
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
the
protective
case.
It
should
have
been
sent
much
sooner
or
through
the
mail
quicker.
I
was
doing
an
online
search
for
a
hotel
in
Williamsburg,
Va
and
this
site
popped
up.
They
offered
a
great
low
rate
for
just
the
Hotel
I
was
hoping
for.
All
I
had
to
do
was
click
a
few
clicks,
and
push
a
few
buttons
and
boom,
I
was
done.
The
whole
process
took
less
than
5
mins.
I
will
definitely
be
coming
back
when
I
book
a
hotel
in
the
future!
Web
site
easy
to
navigate
-
not
such
as
some
web
sites
-
found
item,
placed
order,
checked
out
and
package
arrived
within
a
couple
of
days!
Amazing.
When
you
are
looking
for
a
place
that
will
satisfy
all
of
your
photographic
needs
and
the
expectation
when
you
need
it,
then
B
&
H
Photo-Video
is
the
only
place
to
shop.
Trying
to
reorder
labels
is
difficult
and
cumbersome
on
their
website,
its
strange
you
can't
access
previous
orders
from
the
account
holder
page,
instead
you
have
to
find
a
previous
order
number
and
do
a
search,
thats
really
ridiculous.
The
prices
are
a
tad
expensive,
the
shipping
costs
are
reasonable.
I
will
search
for
an
alternative
label
source.
I
would
use
them
again
but
only
if
I
cannot
find
a
better
solution,
for
now,
it
is
my
expensive,
cumbersome,
clumsy
website
that
I
tolerate
but
do
not
recommend.
The
labels
are
attractive
and
very
good
quality.
I
do
like
the
labels.
Exactly
as
I
ordered.
Perfect
for
the
job.
I
will
use
them
again
once
I
have
the
measurements
for
the
rest
of
my
cars
hoses.
Received
the
wrong
part...description
describes
a
completely
different
part...very
misleading
Very
easy
web
site
to
navigate
through.
The
process
was
easy
but
when
I
first
contacted
the
storage
facility
they
were
not
willing
to
honor
the
quoted
price.

After
some
back
and
forth
they
did.
Great
site
Everything
was
as
described,
will
buy
from
you
again
in
the
future

Shipping
was

needed
a
barrier
to
keep
my
9
week
old
puppy
safe
and
secure
in
part
of
the
open
plaan
kitchen.
This
was
the
only
gate
large
enough
that
did
not
require
drilling/securing
into
a
wall.
Very
secure
-
really
impressed.
i
would
definatley
recommend
mazuma

to
anyone
I
could
not
be
happier
with
my
choice
to
go
with
ID
jewelry.
My
girlfriend
had
found
a
very
unique
type
of
ring
online
from
Gabriel
and
co,
and
this
was
the
first
store
she
went
into
when
shopping
with
her
friend.
Not
even
thinking
they
would
have
the
ring
she
showed
them
a
picture
of
what
she
saw
online
and
asked
if
they
had
anything
similar.
The
jeweler
immediately
recognized
the
ring
and
said
"oh
that's
Gabriel
and
co,
we
have
their
rings!"

They
quoted
her
a
great
price.
She
went
home
and
gave
their
business
card
to
me
and
I
placed
an
order
for
her
ring
on
the
last
day
in
January.
I
was
told
the
turn
around
time
was
3-4
weeks.
But
the
day
before
valentines
day
we
got
an
e
mail
letting
us
know
the
ring
was
ready.
It
was
completed
just
in
time
for
valentines
day,
we
picked
it
up
that
morning
and
it
is
absolutely
stunning.
It
sparkles
so
much
and
the
diamond
is
so
brilliant.
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
quality
and
turnaround
time.
I
will
absolutely
be
using
them
for
our
wedding
bands.
I
love
B&H
for
keeping
a
tremendous
line
of
excellent
gear.

So
many
options
and
such

in
depth
information.

It
is
my
go
to
spot
for
photo
goods.
Good
prices
and
a
fast
and
prompt
delivery
very
pleased
with
the
service!
This
site
came
recommended
by
a
friend...i
found
the
transaction
quick
and
smooth..once
i
was
got
through
the
anti
fraud
verification
stuff!!..but
onced
i
was
verified
the
download
was
instant
and
i
had
my
key
with
in
minutes!!
No
problems,
hassle
free
keys
at
low
prices..what
more
can
i
say!!
B&H
is
always
there.
They
are
close
so
I
usually
get
my
things
the
next
day.
Finding
things
is
fast
and
easy.
Checkout
is
super
fast.
Never
had
a
problem
they
didn't
fix
right
away.
Purchased
a
replacement
side
mirror
and
it
was
quick
delivery
and
much
cheaper
then
dealer
price.
I
am
an
Englishman
living
in
western
USA,
where
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
find
good
shoes.

I
found
the
exact
pair
I
wanted
at
John
Anthony
and
made
the
order
for
delivery
to
the
US.

My
mother
received
a
very
polite
phone
call
at
my
UK
billing
address
to
check
the
order
was
legitimate
and
JA
dispatched
the
shoes
straight
away.

They
arrived
exactly
as
promised
and
now
I
can
walk
on
leather
again,
rather
than
rubber.

Excellent
service,
and
felt
obliged
to
recommend
JA
to
a
friend.
The
First4magnets
is
the
best
place
I
found
on
the
internet
for
magnet
related
products.
It
was
also
cheapest
I
could
find
by
a
considerable
amount.
The
standard
delivery
was
extremely
quick
considering
the
size
of
the
parcel
and
the
price
I
paid
for
the
delivery.
The
courier
First4magnet
used
told
me
within
the
hour
they
were
going
to
deliver
and
even
driver’s
name.
They
also
keep
me
up
to
date
with
where
and
what
the
parcel
was
doing.

The
product
was
exactly
what
I
want
and
was
in
perfect
condition
and
looks
amazing.
I
will
be
using
First4magnets
again.
Great.
It's
about
time
the
rip
off
UK
banks
have
competition.
B
&
H
now,
repeat
now,
has
gotten
the
message
as
to
how
consumers
must
be
treated.

The
online
experience
is
easy
and
complete.

The
shipping
is
immediate
and
we
get
delivery
quickly.

There
still
is
some
delay
and
confusion
in
the
return
process,
but
even
after
some
delay
and
confusion,
the
process
is
completed.
B&H
always
seems
to
have
the
best
prices
on
new
and
used.
I've
used
them
a
few
times,
and
will
continue
to
purchase
from
them
as
my
photography
needs
grow.
Thanks
guys!
Very
helpful
and
polite
driver.
Couldn't
ask
for
a
better
service.
Excellent
service.
Excellent
customer
services.
I
am
very
happy
with
the
service
The
service
was
excellent
and
I
recieved
my
product
a
lot
faster
then
anticipated.
My
purchase
was
also
the
cheapest
that
I
found
online.
I
plan
on
using
PartsGeek
again.
Very
user
friendly
and
easy
to
navigate
through
the
various
choices
and
pages.

The
prices
are
also
fairly
competative,
I
wouldn't
say
cheap
but
competative
with
the
best
priced
sites.
Highly
recommended
as
their
telephonist
was
knowledgeable,
patient
and
got
the
lenses
to
me
the
following
day
on
time
-
pain
free
experience
!!!
We
ordered
the
skid
plate
on
Dec
26,
It
arrived
on
Dec.
30
(despite
holidays,
&
weekend
shipping).

Part
looked
very
familar
for
when
I
owned
a
Passat.

I
used
it
to
rebuild
my
son's
car
after
a
1/2
roll
of
the
car
preceded
by
a
deer
collison.

We
finished
the
car
a
few
minutes
into
2014
as
Andy's
Xmas
present.

Thanks
for
expediting
this
part
of
"The
Big
Gift".
Excellent
web
site
You
would
not
be
disappointed,
these
people
mean
and
know
business
.
given
the
quick
and
easy
shopping
here,
i
would
recommend
it
to
others.
however,
the
activation
cost
for
the
PSN
card
is
quite
expensive.
In
this
store
the
prices
are
good,
prompt
service
and
all
right,
I
am
a
customer
for
several
years
Product
arrived
in
three
days.
No
damage
and
worked
first
time.
I
ordered
my
new
guitar
on
Thursday
and
it
arrived
the
next
day
well
packaged
and
without
damage,
I
chose
GAK
as
it
was
the
best
price
and
came
with
a
free
gift
pack,
The
staff
were
very
friendly,
polite
and
helpful,
I
will
definitely
use
them
again
and
recommend
them
to
friends,
So
far
the
best
place
I
have
found
for
safe
and
delicious
seafood.

High
Quality
and
excellent
service
are
worth
the
price
in
this
case.

I
eat
most
of
my
seafood
raw
and
I
have
not
had
any
issues
with
any
of
the
various
delicacies
from
vital
choice.

Salmon,
tuna,
cod,
scallops,
mussels,
oysters,
squid
and
shrimp
have
all
been
enjoyed.

Some
of
the
most
tasteful
seafood
I
have
eaten
prepared
with
nothing
but
a
little
salt.

I
have
been
purchasing
from
vital
choice
for
more
than
a
year
and
have
never
been
disappointed
with
the
product
or
the
service.
Always
happy
with
the
terms
and
service.

Quality
products
is
also
a
big
plus.
I
have
been
a
customer
for
a
very
long
time.
The
few
times
I
have
had
a
problem
with
an
order
or
had
to
return
the
item,
B&H
has
been
great.
I
am
very
happy
with
them.
I'm
a
repeat
customer
and,
so
far,
they
have
met
all
of
my
expectations.
B&H
has
a
very
broad
set
of
products
for
the
photographer,
good
orer
processing
and
service.
I've
been
ordering
from
B&H
for
several
years
now
for
my
photography
needs.

They
have
very
competitive
pricing,
and
even
when
they
are
a
little
higher,
I'll
pay
a
few
dollars
extra
for
their
service
which
is
outstanding.

They've
earned
my
trust.
My
first
order
with
your
company.
The
web
site
was
great-
easy
to
find
the
correct
parts.
Shipment
arrived
quickly
and
parts
were
very
good
quality
after-market
headlamps.
I
was
disappointed
when
no
directions
were
found
in
the
boxes,
but
they
easily
swapped
out
with
no
issues.
I'm
completely
happy
with
the
whole
order.
Thanks
The
PetFlow
cat
litter
that
I
ordered
is
quite
good
and
I
appreciate
having
it
delivered
to
my
door.
The
pricing,
however,
was
very
high
with
"free
shipping"
offered
one
orders
totaling
just
a
dollar
or
two
above
what
one
large
bag
costs.

This
is
a
shameful
attempt
to
manipulate
me
into
ordering
TWO
bags
of
something
that
I
had
never
tried
before.

I
will
not
order
from
this
compnay
again.

Shame
on
you,
PetFlow.
Great
service.
Order
on
Friday
and
received
it
on
Monday.

Had
no
idea
how
to
change
the
screen,
but
the
instructions
on
line
was
easy
to
follow
and
I
did
it
without
any
problems.

Hope
I
don't
ever
need
another
screen,
but
if
I
do
I
would
order
from
you
again.
Ordered
Sunday,
delivered
Tuesday.
This
is
my
second
order
with
Country
Attire
and
I
will
use
them
again.
Great
service
including
the
email
and
text
updates
stating
the
location
of
my
package
throughout
the
process.
I
CAN
RECOMMEND
VIATOR
AS
A
REASONABLY
PRICED
WAY
TO
BOOK
TOURS
.
I
have
been
ordering
my
sons
incontinence
supplies
from
North
Shore
for
nearly
a
year
now
and
am
always
impressed
by
there
clean
packaging
and
timely
shipping.
All
products
finally
arrived
after
a
week-long
wait.
I
am
surprised
that
all
was
well
with
my
order
after
seeing
the
condition
of
the
box
it
came
in.
The
box
looked
like
it
was
used
for
football
practice.

Everything
is
fine
though
and
I
loved
that
shipping
was
free.
I
was
really
impressed
with
the
quality
of
my
purchases,
rapid
delivery
and
very
friendly
service.
I
won't
hesitate
to
recommend
them
to
my
friends
and
family.
I
will
certainly
buy
from
them
again.
Ordered
one
day
delivered
the
next
-
first
class
service.
Very
good
web
site
too.
Will
use
them
again
and
again.
Brilliant
price,
great
web
site,
terrific
service.
Well
worth
5
stars.
I
ordered
spare
burners
for
my
beefeater
BBQ,
slight
delay
in
despatch
due
to
a
supplier
problem.
Otherwise
100%.
I
find
that
being
able
to
rent
on
line
and
have
all
insurances
etc
covered
there
is
no
hassle
at
the
US
end
(Raleigh
Durham
Airport).Also
being
able
to
chose
between
rental
companies
means
we
get
the
car
we
want,
which
is
important
as
we
go
each
year
for
a
full
holiday.
Era
la
prima
volta
che
noleggiavo
l'
auto
con
usrentacar.co.uk
e
devo
dire
che
il
prezzo
era
il
migliore,
servizio
eccellente,
ottima
l'
applicazione
per
iPhone

usrentacar.
Assolutamente
consigliato!
Competitive
prices,
easy
web
site
to
navigate,
no
delivery
cost
and
fast
and
efficient
delivery
service.
Ordered
and
product
arrived
next
day.
Brilliant.
I
originally
signed
up
to
use
TSO
Host
because
of
some
good
reviews
on
the
web.
Ever
since
I
joined
I
can
say
their
customer
services
have
been
incredible.
Their
speed
of
response
and
help
is
second
to
none.
I
give
them
the
highest
of
recommendations.
Ordered
some
bits
&
bobs
to
upgrade
a
Les
Paul.
All
parts
delivered
quickly
&
as
advertised.
Returned
one
part
of
order
(my
fault)
as
wrong
part
-
replaced
without
hassle.
Excellent
service.
Good
products,
reasonable
price.
I
will
be
using
this
service
again.
Hey!
I'm
a
young
adult
musician
and
i
was
looking
for
a
new
bass
guitar.
I
had
one
in
mind
but
everywhere
was
very
pricey
so
i
heard
this
website
GAK,
was
great
for
prices
so
i
went
on
and
sure
enough
there
was
the
Fender
Bass
i
was
looking
for.
I
thought
"Ok
there's
got
to
be
a
catch
or
something"
but
there
wasn't.
As
i
continued
to
order
it
i
found
that
as
it
was
over
£300
i'd
get
it
shipped
for
free
to
Northern
Ireland.
"Wow
that's
generous".
I
continued
to
see
when
my
delivery
would
be..."i
can
choose?
Holy
****"
As
soon
as
possible
was
the
obvious
choice
but
i
doubted
that
was
the
truth.
Two
days
later
here
i
am
"slappin'
da
bass"
like
a
pro.
Cheers
GAK.
Definitely
the
best
music
site
on
the
internet!
Needed
to
pick
up
one
of
these
for
work.
Got
it
for
less
than
my
local
dealers
and
no
shipping
or
taxes.
Will
definitely
use
them
again
in
the
near
future.
We
had
a
great
time.

It
was
perfect
for
us
since
we
had
only
1
day
to
try
to
see
London.
We
must
of
spent
two
full
hours
looking
for
something
in
our
time
frame
and
location.
For
sure
the
options
are
limited.
Location
Location
Location.
Just
not
there.
Had
a
great
experience.
There
was
a
problem
with
our
original
hotel
and
they
called
to
let
us
know
they
had
upgraded
us
to
a
different
resort
for
the
same
price
and
would
take
care
of
all
the
changes
for
the
tours.
Couldn't
have
asked
for
a
better
travel
agent
for
Costa
Rica
vacation.
Would
highly
recommend
anyone
wanting
to
go
to
Costa
Rica
to
use
them.
i
got
my
order
real
fast
the
sivice
was
grate
Good
job.Quickly
and
qualitatively
I
have
dealt
with
BH
for
many
years(decades)
.
there
never
was
any
disappointment.
Hoping
many
other
retailer
has
BH's
trustworthiness.
your
reliability
remains
same
The
experience
was
great.
They
were
able
to
price
match
the
tires
I
needed
without
any
hassle.
They
were
right
on
time
no
waits
and
the
truck
was
ready
to
the
minute
they
told
me.
The
clerk
went
over
my
paperwork
and
answered
questions.
Great
job.
it
was
a
great
experience
they
worked
with
me
so
I
could
get
in
and
out
with
my
car
in
time
for
work.
Parts
came
ok
but
1
box
was
shipped
with
a
radiator
support
and
an
air
conditioner
coil
and
the
box
was
7
feet
long
and
ripped
to
shreds


Re
taped
from
ups.

No
parts
damaged.
Just
looked
really
bad
on
arrival.
Other
parts
came
with
no
issues,
double
fan
and
radiator.
I
would
still
recommend
and
use
your
company
I'm
glad
I
was
able
to
find
this
site.

Saved
me
50%
on
a
product.

Bought
a
year
supply
of
BCAA's.
On
time,
very
organised,
many
thanks
it
was
an
easy
way
of
getting
the
thing
I
wanted.Easy
to
buy
and
quick
delivery.
Just
what
I
wanted
Total
order
process
easy,
my
first
order
arrived
promptly
and
as
described.
Excellent
value
for
money.
Well
done
Nice
design,and
well
worth
the
money,
looks
good
on
the
course
and
off
it.
No
problems,
quality

Quick

A

Good

Good

One
place
I
would
always
look
when
buying
outdoor
equipment
We
are
a
small
boutique
web
design
and
video
production
studio
and
definitely
do
not
have
staff
that
can
be
dedicated
to
transcribing
the
audio
on
our
productions.

if
we
did
more
scripted
projects
we
would
not
have
a
need
like
this
but
asking
non-pros
to
memorize
lines
and
then
deliver
them
in
a
believable
manner
is
just
not
going
to
happen.

We
re-purpose
our
projects
to
optimize
them
in
other
areas
so
we
need
solid
transcription
services.
I
have
tried
many
different
models
of
ecigs
and
various
eliquids
from
several
vendors
and
I
can
say
hands
down
these
guys
are
the
best!
I
purchased
the
CE6
starter
kit
and
it's
amazing!
With
previous
ecigs
I
always
found
myself
craving
real
cigarettes
still,
but
with
these
and
this
quality
eliquid
I
would
never
dream
of
touching
a
real
cig
again....
Obviously
I
still
have
my
nicotine
addiction
and
it
costs
money
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
who
really
cares,
I
get
to
enjoy
myself
and
no-one
gets
hurt!
It
almost
feels
like
I'm
cheating!
lol.
If
anyones
thinking
of
starting
I
would
recommend
these
guys
and
the
CE6
starter
kit
to
anyone!
You
won't
be
disappointed!
:)
Love
the
information,
simplicity,
and

festive!
Delighted
with
blinds.
They
are
good
quality
&
reasonable
priced.
Recieved
within
a
week
&
No
trouble
to
install.
We
originally
ordered
for
just
one
room,
but
we
were
so
happy
with
them
we
purchased
more
blinds
for
all
of
the
front
of
the
house
and
they
look
great.
And
we
have
had
lots
of
comments
from
neighbours.
Thank
you
for
a
great
buy!!!
I'd
had
a
rear
tyre
blow
out
and
my
car
was
a
bit
of
a
mess,
so
I
had
a
lot
of
concerns
about
Kwik
Fit's
ability
to
resolve
the
issue
outside
of
a
garage.
I
need
not
have
worried.
The
guy
Jeff
who
came
to
fit
the
tyres
was
a
legend
and
as
well
as
fitting
the
tyres
(which
he
did
quickly
and
efficiently),
he
was
able
to
offer
lots
of
helpful
advice
on
my
car.
Town

always
been
the

i

a

hundred
each
of
2
types
of
flashbay
2g
USB
drives.
Shipped
two
sets
of
clubs.
Only
possible
snag
could
have
been
locating
the
two
shipping
boxes.
I
received
the
parts
very
quickly
and
the
parts
are
of
good
quality.
I
would
definitely
recommend
buying
from
this
company.

Parts
are
priced
right
and
customer
service
is
excellent
on
responding
back
promptly
if
you
have
a
problem.

I
will
definitely
order
from
them
again.
Very
large

and

Great

but
also
incredibly
fast

I
had
my
groupset
in
Australia
only
4
days.
Nice
work
Merlin.
I
have
two
complaints.
One
with
the
service
and
the
other
with
the
car
itself.
We
were
given
the
lancia
ypsilon.
I
asked
to
switch
to
a
fiat
500
but
was
told
that
none
were
available,
though
there
were
some
present
in
the
parking
garage.
We
were
told
that
it
was
an
upgrade,
but
the
lancia
Ypsilon
and
the
fiat
500
are
the
same
car
class
(sub
compact).
The
Ypsilon
had
poor
visibility
in
both
rear
and
side
windows
making
it
difficult
to
park
and
back
up
in
urban
areas.
It
also
lack
the
horsepower
needed
for
the
hilly
terrain
in
Tuscany.

The
gentleman
that
we
dropped
our
car
off
with
at
the
end
of
our
trip
was
very
friendly
and
provided
us
with
good
service.
I
was
quoted
£400
by
my
Honda
main
dealer
for
4
tyres
for
my
Civic.
Checked
Blackcircles,
and
got
the
same
tyres
fitted
for
£270,
at
a
Citroen
main
dealer.
I
even
rang
BC
customer
service
the
day
before
I
had
booked
in
at
the
garage,
to
see
if
they
could
accommodate
it
me
on
that

instead,
and
they
sorted
it
all
for
me.
I
will
tell
other
people
about
your
good
service
I
messed
up
my
order,
wrote
Onnit
for
help,
and
they
replied
within
a
day
and
fixed
everything.
Will
order
with
them
again
for
sure.
Extremely
efficient
and
expedient
service
with
a
variety
of
items
at
reasonable
prices
Great
Service
And
Comms
Could'nt
Fault
THANK
YOU
Great
Website
over
all.

Easy
to
checkout,
great
deals,
never
had
a
problem,
and
shipping
is
always
fast.

I
haven't
found
a
better
website
yet.
I
liked
the
parts
but
shipping
was
to
much
I
ordered
some
trainers
and
a
cap,
paid
for
speedy
delivery
as
really
wanted
the
trainers
for
my
holiday.
Been
using
Inkfarm
for
a
few
years
now.
Once
I
had
a
problem
with
a
cartridge
and
it
was
replaced
quickly.
I've
found
this
to
be
a
quick,
easy,
cost
efficient
service.
Mostly
used
for
last
minute
bookings,
Anytime
I
need
to
use
papyal
for
in-game
cash
cards
or
game
time,
this
is
the
place
I
go!
The
service
is
fast,
easy,
and
the
codes
have
never
failed.
I
also
like
the
fact
that
if
you
are
a
first
time
customer
OR
if
you
haven't
purchased
in
a
while,
they
will
make
you
verify
yourself
either
by
phone
or
text.
I
used
to
always
talk
to
someone
on
the
phone
and
I
am
not
sure
when
the
text
feature
was
added
but
that
is
awesome
as
well!
Had
to
replace
parts
for
my
2002
Avalanche
great
parts
at
a
great
price!
From
shopping,
to
financing,
to
out
the
door
was
a
great
experience.
There
was
agreat
selection
and
with
the
ability
to
preshop
online
with
approval,
my
shopping
was
easy.
I
am
very
pleased
with
my
"new"
used
car.
My
salesman,
Richard,
in
Pensacola,
got
me
just
what
I
wanted
with
payments
I
can
afford.
He
and
the
rest
of
the
staff
in
Pensacola
made
a
great
impression
on
me.
I
would
highly
recommend
to
everyone
to
visit
DriveTime
for
their
next
car.
Thanks

is
a

Quick,
effective
and
high
quality
level.
Too
many
companies
have
promised
something
and
delivered
something
else
you
know
what
I
mean.
THIS
is
the
only
company
that
said
what
they
were
going
to
and
DID
it
exactly
and
then
went
extra
mile.
My
old
96'
Oldsmobile
Achieva
was
about
to
break
down
on
me
from
the
wear
and
tire
from
old
age

and
I
needed
a
new
reliable
car
to
get
me
to
work
and
other
personal
use.
I
try
going
to
a
dealership
like
Jeff
Wyler
but
my
credit
was
not
perfect
and
they
turn
me
down
and
wouldn't
work
me
at
all.

I
pulled
into
DriveTime
lot
on
Beechmont
Ave,
Cincinnati
Ohio
to
inquire
about
purchasing
a
car
and
was
greeted
and
treated
warmly.
I
talk
to
a
guy
named
Jerrann
Wright
and
told
me
about
my
situation
and
he
was
very
helpful
and
understanding
and
help
me
look
at
my
options
and
help
me
thought
the
application
process
and
was
immediately
approved
for
a
car
loan
that
same
night
and
by
the
next
day
after
I
sign
all
the
necessary
paperwork
I
was
in
my
new

Red
Chevy
Colbalt
which
I
absolutely
loved!
Thanks
Jerrann
and
all
the
staff
at
Beechmont
DriveTime
for
getting
me
a
new
car!
The
Radiator
came

very
early

the
next
day,and
it
was
the
exact

match.
I
will
buy
from
you
again.
Great
service
I
am
happy
customer.
Waited
seven
days
to
receive
part.

It
is
incorrect
so
we
have
to
send
it
back,
we
find
out
after
the
fact
that
we
have
to
pay
shipping
regardless
of
whose
fault
it
is.
We
are
definitely
very
disappointed
with
this
service.

DID
ALL
THE

USE
THESE
GUYS!
Good
quality,
arrived
quickly,
no
problems
I
have
used
Arena
a
few
times
before
and
I
wanted
to
surprise
my
wife
with
a
birthday
treat
whilst
on
holiday.

It's
impossible
to
know
what
local
florists
are
going
to
be
like
so
using
Arena
seemed
like
the
obvious
thing.

We
had
a
beautiful
bouquet
delivered
on
the
right
day
and
with
flowers
still
in
bud
--
they
still
look
amazing
days
afterwards.
This
is
the
second
time
I've
used
the
site
and
both
shopping
experiences
have
been
great.
My
codes
arrived
very
quickly
and
all
worked
without
any
issue.
Redding

had
the
best
price
on
the
item
I
wanted.
They
personalized
(engraved)
it
very
fast
and
shipped
the
item
the
very
first
business
day
after
I
ordered.
Shipping
was
quick,
the
order
arrived
by
the
time
I
needed
it,
and
everything
in
the
whole
process
went
smoothly.
I
highly
recommend
buying
from
this

Books
came
quickly
and
were
cheap.
What
more
can
I
ask
for?
I
received
a
direct
fit
part
that
wasn't
a
direct
fit
at
all.
The
problem
wasn't
a
Parts
Geek
error,
but
an
error
from
the
manufacturer
of
the
part.
When
I
approached
Parts
Geek
with
the
problem
it's
almost
like
they
were
questioning
me
about
the
problem,
as
if
they
weren't
going
to
accept
the
return.
I
ended
up
contacting
the
manufacturer,
who
resolved
the
problem
IMMEDIATELY.
So,
all
in
all,
it
was
a
pleasant
experience,
but
had
nothing
to
do
with
Parts
Geek.
I
probably
won't
be
placing
another
order
because
of
the
customer
service
I
received,
because
if
there
is
a
problem,
I
most
likely
will
encounter
issues
with
returns.
See
my
opinion.
Excellent
fitness
products,
very
good
service.
They
are
so
rich
and
successful
that
they
can
afford
to
hire
someone
to
send
their
products
out
instead
of
doing
it
themselves.
Now
THAT's
successful!
I
know
that
if
I
was
rich

and
successful
enough
to
hire
someone
to
walk
out
to
my
mail
box
and
mail
my
letters,
I'd
sure
DO
it.
Who
CARES
if
it
stays
in
one
place
for
3
or
more
days?
No
my
problem!
Keep
up
the
great
work.
Kudos.

The
only
concern
I
have

is
that

obtain
anything

than
several

In

their

waiting

never

Being

Items
that

I

Pefect.
My
experience
with
Senior
Annuity
Alert
was
a
positive
one.
It
was
very
educational,
and
their
products
were
thoroughly
explained
with
no
sales
pressure.
They
were
able
to
set
me
up
in
three
hybrid
annuities
and
set
up
an
Schwab
IRA
stock
and
cash
account.
In
the
Schwab
account
they
purchased
many
dividend
bearing
stocks
to
supplement
my
annuities.
So
far
I
am
pleased
with
the
performance
of
these
stocks,
as
the
account
is
growing
steadily.
Currently
I
have
not
withdrawn
any
of
proceeds
from
the
annuities
or
the
dividend
stocks,
but
will
in
the
not
too
distance
future.
Based
on
my
experiences
with
Senior
Annuity
Alert,
I
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend

this
company
to
anyone
already
retired
or
nearing
retirement.
Found
it

to

how

the

that

Wonderful
website
with
an
easily
navigable
store.

The
product
suggestions
at
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
pages
are
really
helpful.

I
have
no
complaint
about
the
pricing,
as
it's
only
a
little
more
than
the
cheaper
prices
one
might
find
on
amazon
or
similar
sites.

They
were
quick
to
send
the
items
on
their
way,
so
I
got
my
little
package
pretty
fast,
considering
it
was
sent
all
the
way
to
my
FPO
overseas.

I
even
had
a
chance
to
email
one
of
the
customer
service
reps
and
she
was
really
friendly
and
quick
to
respond
to
my
question.

I
cant
think
of
anything
else
I'd
ask
for
in
an
online
vendor,
particularly
for
niche
goods
such
as
they
have.
Although
i
would
say
the
service
was
excellent,
i
would
make
one
suggestion.
We
ordered
a
drum
of
cable
along
with
various
fittings
for
networking.
The
drum
arrived
the
next
day
and
we
waited
for
several
days
for
the
fittings
to
arrive.
Only
when
one
of
the
boys
in
the
warehouse
decided
to
make
a
start
on
the
wiring
while
we
were
waiting
on
the
fittings
did
we
open
up
the
drum.
On
opening,
we
discovered
that
all
the
fittings
had
been
expertly
packed
inside.
Yes
we
feel
like
prats
for
not
thinking
of
this,
but
an
email
would
have
been
good
to
let
us
know
you
had
done
this.
We
will
know
for
next
time.
The
cards
came
in
a
very
timely
manner.
The
only
issue
to
be
aware
of
is
the
condition
of
the
cards.
They
are
a
little
beat
up.
Great
if
you
are
using
them
personally,
not
so
great
if
you
want
to
give
them
as
a
gift.
If
you
need
a
replacement
part,
this
is
a
good
provider
.

They

Easy

The
booking
process
with
interparcel
was
very
easy
and
straight
forward.
I
booked
for
a
package
to
be
picked
up
by
TNT
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon.
Sadly
it
was
not
picked
up
until
Thursday
afternoon
after
having
to
re-book
twice.
Interparcel
customer
service
was
satisfactory
and
the
TNT
driver
was
very
helpful
when
he
finally
arrived
to

The
parcel
was
delivered
quickly
and
I
was
duly
informed
as

Always
a
trouble-free,
easy
experience.
I
AM
STILL
WAITING
TO

THIS
ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!
The
only
reservation
I
would
make
other
than
using
priceline
is
when
I
stay
on
long
trips,
and
the
oly
reason
I
would
do
it
then
is
to
ensure
I
got
an
extended
stay
hotel
that
has
a
kitchen.
I
travel
for
buisness
and
get
paid
a
small
perdeim,
Priceline
helps
me
maximise
the
amount
I
get
to
keep
for
myself.
I
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
travel
and
save
money
be
it
for
vacation
or
other
types
of
travel.

I've
been
using
Delivery.com
since
I
moved
to
New
York
City
in
2011
and
it's
been
nothing
short
of
a
dream
to
be
able
to
order
food
at
3
a.m.
from
my
favorite
diner
or
to
order
pad
thai
when
it's
snowy
or
dreary
outside,
among
many
other
situations.
I've
never
had
an
issue
with
Delivery.com
and
I
plan
to
stick
with
them
in
the
future.
Made
enquireies
re

advice.
This
is
the
first
time
I

from
this

Their

I
switched
from
Verizon
2
months

when
I
decided
to

While
the
coverage

is
not

good
as
verizon
or
AT&T

the
price
sure
is.

I
get
coverage
in
all
the
places
that
I
frequent
and
that
is
what
is
important.
I

Never

I

with

of
the
local
stores
with
sales
associates
how
really
did
not
know
the
product.

The
prices
at
SW
have
always
saved
me
big
money
as
compared
to
the
store,
and
the
reviews
have
always
provided
better
information
than
the
local
unknowning
sales
guy.
Easy
and
as
described.
i
have
used
Auto
Europe
for
3
car
rentals
in
the
past
9
months.
All
arrangements
have
gone
perfectly
and
each
time
the
vehicle
was
above
my
expectations.The
pricing
was
also
the
best
I
could
find
each
time
after
extensive
online
searches.I
would
definitely
recommend
them
to
anyone.
The
items
were
exactly
as
described.

The
communications
were
excellent
and
the
delivery
was
first
class
Easy
to
order.

Speedy
delivery.

What's
not
to
be
happy
about.
I
was
asked
very
specific
questions
regarding
my
driving
needs.
This
was
my
first
time
shipping
my
clubs
for
a
golf
weekend.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
there
was
no
issues
going
there
and
no
issues
coming
home.
I
will
definitely
use
your
services
again
and
will
undoubtly
refer
you
to
my
friends
over
shipping
with
the
other
guys
or
going
thru
the
airport.
My
item
was
shipped
promptly
and
arrived
very
quickly
and
in
perfect
condition.

I
would
definitely
purchase
items
again
from
Tahoe
Mountain
Sports.
As
a
two-car
Saab
owner,
its
getting
dicey
finding
parts.

My
first
experience
with
Europarts
was
excellent
and
I'll
be
shopping
there
again
in
the
near
future.

The
web
site
was
outstanding
and
makes
it
very
easy
to
search
for
even
the
most
obscure
part.
First
time
customer.
I
found
the
glass
knobs
online
-
crystal
levers
for
less
than
$50
per
set.
The
store
near
my
house
wanted
$190
per
set.
I
have
10
doors
-
this
company
offered
more
finishes,
better
products
-
and
at
a
$1400
SAVINGS!
I
have,
in
fact,
recommended
B&H
to
friends
and
family
over
the
years.
The
quality
of
the
products,
the
exceptionally
complete
web
site,
the
call-in
consultation,
the
prompt
delivery
of
orders,
the
ease
of
return
(used
only
once,
on
a
broken
item)
combine
to
make
B&H
unique
in
my
experience
of
online
retailers.

The
price
is
seldom
the
cheapest

but
almost
always
pretty
good;
but
I
trust
B&H...
it's
that
simple.

I
don't
order
much
online,
but
when
I
do
I
check
B&H
first.
i
got
your

name
off
the
internet
i
am
so
glad
i
did
i
have
lost
all
my
ackes
and
pains
in
just
a
few
days
cant
fault
the
sevice
here
very
quickly

very

very

please
When
the
ink
runs
out
for
your
printer
and
you
can
not
only
get
it
cheaper
than
running
to
the
store
or
ordering
from
some
other
sites,
but
get
it
expedited,
you
have
to
love
it!
As
soon
as
ordered
my
parts,
I
immediately
received
an
email
saying
my
order
will
ship
out
soon.
The
next
day
I
received
my
order.
Great
service
and
fast
shipping!
I
looked
at
the
website
that
the
link
was
supposed
to
go
to
:
Hampton
Inn.

Now
I
learn
that
I
did
not
even
talk
with
anyone
at
Hilton
Honors
or
the
hotel.

I
even
asked
if
this
was
the
hotel
and
the
person
said
yes.

This
is
dishonest
and
IMHO
illegal.

These
guys
should
be
shut
down
as
a
spam
site.
Everything
was
as
described,
unbelivable
price
and
the
product
quality
is
great.

very
simple
process
and
it
was
delivered
pretty
quick.

Thanks

wonders

with

like
I
did
in

I
tell
them
match

and
I'll
buy
your

Their

no

can
they
match

Shipping
took
a

longer
to

the

I
purchased
this

I

Excellent.
great
merchant
--
i've
never
had
any
complaints
My
order
arrived
on
time
and
as
promised.
And,
the
price
was
quite
reasonable.
I
would
repeat.
I
used
to
shop
mainly
at
another
big,
very
popular,
cycle
company,
but
now
i
mainly
use
Merlin
Cycles
because
their
prices
are
always
best!
The
service
they
provide
is
also
good,
so
its
a
no
brainer!
Sehr
guter
Service
und
Personal
I
am
pleased
with
my
purchase
they
actually
feel
better
on
your
teeth
the
way
the
brush
is
laid
out
only
thing
is
they
drain
the
battery
quicker
and
go
slower.
But
overall
good
value
for
money.
I
have
bought
a
number
of
items
from
The
Natural
Sapphire
Company
and
their
service
is
top
notch.
I
have
absolutely
no
complaints
with
their
staff
or
service.
My
only
complaint
is
somewhat
one
of
perception
and
relative
value.
I
findthe
quality
of
the
merchandise
to
be
excellent.
With
that
said,
if
you
price
their
gemstones
on
the
open
market,
you
will
find
that
there
is
not
a
market,
insurer,
or
private
buyer
who
will
appraise
their
jewelry
anywhere
near
their
retail
price
(or
even
a
well
negotiated
price).
like
my
one
sentence
opinion
said
I
would
definitely
recommend
buying
from
this
company,
slightly
cheaper
prices,
really
fast
delivery,
and
fantastic
customer
service.
Simple
and
fast.
Items
are
way
less
expensive
then
some
of
the
other
vitamin
shops
or
supplement
websites.
My
only
website
where
i
will
order
my
supplements
for

An
incredibly
simple
process
that
had
the
money
sitting
in
my
account
within
7

no

no

I
was
really
impressed.

I
agree
when
they
do
say
"humem

that
is
the
honest
truth.
From
the
working
out

to
the
foods
and
supliments.....
And
the
clothing
too.
Everything
is
well
made
and
I
do
feel
that
I
have
gaind
a

from

item
as
described
This
was
my
first
time
to
order
from
Oldies
and
order
arrived
very
expeditiously
and
was
in
great
shape
on
arrival.
They
had
a
particularly
difficult
job
at
my
house,
having
to
get
a
huge
French
door
set
with
3
panels
into
the
house.
Once
they
took
out
the
old
door
they
found
the
frame
and
base
were
rotten.
With
no
complaint
at
all
they
sent
one
person
to
get
more
timber,
and
set
about
remediating
the
problem.
They
were
quick
and
courteous
-
and
very
entertaining!
They
finished
the
job,
cleaned
up
and
left
me
with
a
wonderful
new
exit
to
my
deck.
Highly
recommended!

At
first
I
thought,
"this
can't

The
dealer
price
for
the
part
I
wanted
was
$200.
Someone
was
going
to
give
me
a
deal
in
Arizona
for
$120
(plus
shipping).
Then
I
found
Parts

They
wanted
$54
and
free
shipping!
Unbelievably

and
when
there
was
a

they
took
care

it,

I
had

of
$20
for
the
wrong
part
sent
twice.
The

I
found
the
parts
by
googling
Parts

and
the

it
came
up
right

same
problem
and
never
really
addressed
the
issue
to
correct
the
phone
in
the
right
way
due
to
the
bottom
line
of
the
limit
of
what
is
the
phone
worth.
They
where
willing
to
help
but
never
really
addressed
the
problem.
Fast
delivery,
very
helpful
and
friendly
Speedy
delivery
Great
company
to
buy
from.
From
the
ordering
to
receiving
the
final
shipment
this
company
is
all
about
customer
service.
The
price
is
so
much
cheaper
than
anywhere
else
Had
our
product
in
just
a
few
days.
I
broke
a
couple
pieces
after
receiving
and
they
sent
me
information
for
replacement
parts
right
away.
Very
good
service.
Will
order
here
again.
Supplement
warehouse
is
amazing.
I
haven't
got
my
order
yet
I
strongly
recommend
you
consider
Ink
Station
for
all
your
printer
products.
Their
large
range
of
products
are
well
documented
and
reasonably
priced.
Placing
an
order
is
extremely
simple
and
straight-forward.
Ink
Station
provides
a
copy
of
your
invoice
and
offers
a
fast
and
secure
delivery
service.
An
easy
and
no
fuss
experience.
The
selection
of
glasses
at
Select
spec
was
by
far
superior
to
other
sights
that
might
offer
glasses
at
a
cheaper
price
because

there
frames
are
not
the
same
quality
as
Select
spec.
They
offer
top
of
the
line
frames
such
as
Oakley,
that
you
can't
find
on
other
sights.
The
only
complaint
I
have
is
that
they
should
have
a
phone
number
that
lets
you
talk
to
a
live
person.
I
am
sure
they
would
get
more
business
I
f
they
had
someone
people
could
talk
to
and
be
reassured
if
they
have
a
question
or
problem
with
their
order.
I
believe
their
ticket
system
could
be
refined
so
as
not
to
create
a
new
ticket
each
time
you
correspond
with
the
company.
They
should
also
update
the
customer
with
an
email
every
step
of
the
process
so
they
are
not
left
wondering
what
is
going
on
with
the
order.
People
like
it
when
they
know
what
is
going
on
and
are
apt
to
be
more
patient
then
being
left
in
the
dark
especially
when
they
pay
upfront.
I've
been
ordering
from
Supplement
Warehouse
for
two
years
now,
and
I've
got
to
say,
they've
never
let
me
down.
Shipping
is
quick
for
me
(I
usually
ship
either
to
Chicago
or
Lake
Forest)
and
the
products
arrive
in
perfect
condition.
You
can't
beat
their
prices
(literally,
you
can't)
and
whats
more,
you
get
free
stuff
with
every
order!
I

Excellent
Villa
fully
lived
up
to
expectations
with
one
exception
,
pool
was
a
bit
chilly
for
the
kids
but
was
early
season
so
kind
of
expected
,
maybe
the
heating
could
have
been
turned
up
a
bit
more.
We
stayed
in
one
in
October
and
there
was
steam
coming
off
the
top
and
was
fully
useable.
However,
fantastic
Villa
in
good
location
easy
walk
to
the
beach.
Would
definitely
stay
here
again.
Villa
was
very
clean
and
cleaned
mid
week
to
a
high
standard.
Fully
kitted
out
for
anything
you
wanted
or
needed.
Top
brand
selected
but
with
added
free
gift
made
the
purchase
one
of
the
best
value
on
the
market.
The
whole
experience
is
very
slick,
however
I
feel
the
"confirm
your
bank
details
before
we
send
you
your
money"
email
is
a
trick
which
nets
music
magpie
a
lot
of
money
to
hold
on
to
by
emails
which
aren't
responded
to.
I
for
one
never
received
this
email
and
only
knew
I
had
to
confirm
by
visiting
and
logging
into
my
account.
Just
do
it
and
save
yourself
the
hassles.
I
was
extremely
angry
with
myself
when
my
expensive
prescription
sunglasses
fell
off
of
my
face
while
I
was
swimming
in
Lake
Michigan.

They
cost
me
almost
two
hundred
dollars,
even
with
my
insurance.

I
was
glad
to
find
this
website
so
that
I
could
order
a
prescription
pair
for
a
quarter
of
the
price.

The
glasses
were
delivered
on
time
and
look
great.
Quick,
efficient
and
reasonably
priced.
Will
buy
again.
I
have
purchased
several
keys
over
the
years
from
CJS
keys,
and
to
be
honest.
There
is
no
educated
or
logical
reason
to
go
anywhere
else.
The
have
their
own
"AutoKey"
system
which
is
an
instantaneous
screenshot
of
the
key
(in
the
event
a
game
company
wants
to
ask
for
a
picture
of
the
cd-key
itself
,
you
can
download
it
and
show
them
or
keep
for
your
own
records)
It
is
stored
securely
in
a
database
and
you
can
access
it
whenever
you
so
choose.
I
highly
recommend
CJS
keys
for
ALL
of
your
CD
key
needs.
Not
only
is
the
PRICE
the
best
on
the
internet,
its
the
people
and
employees
behind
the
company
that
really
make
it
shine.
Also
having
the
best
CD
Key
distribution
in
the
industry
doesn't
hurt
either.

Great

1

The

was

and
knowledgeable.
This

allows
one
to
enter
UPC
codes
using
the
keyboard
or
a
scanner.

I
used
the
keyboard
and
after
entering
each
CD/DVD/Book
was
added
to
the
aggregate
list
with
a
price
they'd
pay.

After
entering
them

I
took
out
each
I
felt
wasn't
worth
selling,

was
low
so
gave
them
to
charity
instead,
and
the
list
revised
itself.

Finally
I
printed
the
receipt,
shipping
label,
and
sent
them
out.

My
stuff
was
in
excellent
condition
and
they
paid
exactly
what
was
promised.

The
only
thing
they
could
do
better
is
to
accept
some
of
the
older
UPC
codes
that
have
1
or
2
fewer
digits.

I
give
them
4.5
stars
rather
than
5
because
of
this.
When

am
looking
to
buy

my
first
thought
is
Ebuyer

exceptional

deliveries.

I
used
to
compare

but
Ebuyer
won

down

I
just

After

I
reflected
on
how
well
our
meetings
went.

On
schedule,
no
delays,
everyone
invited
from
around
the
US
and
Europe
in
attendance.

I
really
needed
to
reachout
and
thank
our
coordinator
in
the
UK.

What
better
way
to
say
thanks
than
by
sending
a
nice
bouquet
of
fresh
flowers?

Teleflorist

Just
a

and

Perfect!
Good

the

were

still
a

A

Then

one
day
earlier.
Well....that
was
easy!
I
was
able
to
map

easy
and
realize
that
public
transportation
was
close

making

The

I
just
made
the
plunge
into
the
world
of
wet
shaving
(sorry
for
the
bad
pun).
I
discovered
the
West
Coast
Shaving
website
and
was
blown
away
by
the
diversity
and
selection
of
the
products
they
offer.
I
made
my
purchases
based
upon
the
reviews
left
by
other
customers
and
was
definitely
impressed
with
the
quality
of
product
and
the
great
shaves
I
have
had
since.
The
prices
are
very
reasonable
and
the
shipping
was
fast.
I
will
continue
to
purchase
all
of
my
shaving
products
from

in
the
future.
The
website
is
really
easy
to

not

Second
time
ordering
from
Supplement
Warehouse.

I
recieved
my
first
order
on

and
the

makes
this
a
must
use.
I've
been

from

several
years

and
have
nothing
negative

This
is
absolutely
the
best
website
for
acquiring
supplements
and
nootropics.
It's
the
most
expensive
supplement
site
I've
ever
used,
but
it's
well
worth
the
price.
The
finest
ingredients,
the
most
comprehensive
random
assortment
of
cool
foods
and
snacks,
and
one
killer
workout
tech
section.
The
addition
of
Onnit

was
PERFECT
timing
and
I'll
try
using
that
product
for

(For
science
of
course.)
I'm
trying
to
convert
the

I
just
want
to
thank
Onnit
for
the
fine
quality
and
ease
of
buying
supplements
for
any
occasion.
Just
wish
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
that
way
I
could
actually
try
something
new
on
the
site
instead
of
only
having
enough
money
to
buy
more

I
wanted

Purchase
was
easy,
delivery
was

Can't
think
of
anything
that
could
be
better.
Id
never
even
considered
wearing
a
kilt,
let
alone
buying
one.
But
when
it
became
clear
i
needed
to
bite
the
bullet,
I
googled
'kilts'
and
up
came
the
Buyakilt
website.
Im
usually
a
suspicious
buyer
when
it
comes
to
websites,
but
I
was
reassured
by
the
amount
of
information
and
advice
on
the
site,
which
suggested
it's
a
professional
operation.
When
it
came
to
placing
my
order,
there
were
many
different
options
to
choose
from
and
im
pleased
i
was
able
to
personalise
my
kilt
in
that
way.
The
next
day
a
member
of
the
team
emailed
me
to
check
my
measurements
(which
seemed
a
little
'out',
I
blame
tape
measure
of
course)
so
that
was
a
welcome
touch.
Must
admit
the
shop
made
it
so
easy
to
purchase
products,
i
didnt
really
look
around.
Came
online
to
try
some
protein
complex,
and
saw
the
website
also
recommended
a
creatine
product.
Id
already
read
a
bit
about
creatine
so
i
followed
the
link
and
bang,
its
in
the
basket!
Then
a
super
easy
process
to
the
checkout,with
no
additional
fees.
Nice
job!

Airport
parking
is
way
too
expensive.

The
airport
shuttles
are
often
crowded,
late,
and
inefficient.

That
is
why
we
love
Globalairportparking.

It
is
much
less
expensive,
the
drivers
are
usually
very
friendly,
and
they
get
us
to
the
airport
much
faster
than
the
shuttles
inside
the
airport.

We
highly
recommend
them!

I
was
really
impressed
with
how
efficient
the
whole
service
with
Simply
Supplements
was,
quick
delivery
and
most
importantly
the
price
for
my

was
most
competitive.
I
was
really
impressed
with
how
easy
it
was
to
order,
the
delivery
was
with
me
within
two
days.

The
packaging
was
most
impressive
and
the
most
important
factor
the
lenses
are
top

Overall
I
was
delighted
with
the
order
and
the
savings
were
great!

I
will
definately
be
back
for
more.
however
i
feel
they
should
aloud
customers
to
use
more
colors
n
patters.
After
all
youre
paying
like
almost
300
bucks
for
them
in
some
cases.
they
have
great
pricing
but
the
shipping
was
expensive
nor
did
it
have
options
for
different
shipping.
Overall
great
products
for
quality
pricing
Couldn't
believe
the
price
on
the
all
inclusive

If
I
had
known
it
was
going
to
be
this
cheap,
I
would've
been
traveling

years.
Now
people
want
to
meet
me
in

BAM!!!!
Sitting

I

the

very
competitive

not
better

most.
I
found
that
I
do
not

to

any
more,
I
know
I
am
getting
a
fair

I
am
recent

I
can
say
only
bad
and
very
bad
things
about
this

I
really
don't

that
any
of

I

Maybe
not
as
competitive
with
regards
to

but
the

so
good
it's
worth
the

Using

easy.

located
the
part
I
needed.
Ordering
was
simple.
The

and
it

quickly.
No

I
ordered
a
Fuel

for

I
use
it
for
a

I
found
the
BEST

on

I
had
a

I
logged
on,
looking
for
a
specific
piece,
without
any
hidden
restrictions.
I
found
what
i
was
looking
for
easily
and
signed
up
with
little
effort.
The
package
arrived
before
the
delivery
date,
perfectly
packaged
and
safe.
My
storage
was
open
(someone
force
the
door)
and
some
of
my
stuff
was
stolen.
It
happenned
with
other
storage
places
near
mine
too.
Great
looking
trophy.
Rather
challenging
for
one
person
to
center
the
golf
ball
between
the
two
angled
supports.
Prices
are
cheaper
than

I
used
to

away.
The
whole

was
quick
and
painless
at
both

of
the

Particularly
impressed
on
return
to
Bristol

at
1135
pm
at

we
were

off
in

largely

The

was
fast
and
efficient.
Delivery
was
quicker
than
suggested
and
I
was
kept
updated
on
progress.
Just
one
small
issue
in
that
the
colour
match
between
website
and
the
headguard
that
arrived
was
poor.
However
I
could
have
sent
the
guard
back
but
didn't
-
it
was
very
good
quality
and
a
very
good
service.
No
better
or
worse
than
other

price
is
good
on
some

so
good
on
others.

I

my

I

a

I
received
them
they
look
massive
on
my
truck
and
made
my

look
small
and
out
of

flares
had
a

on
them
from
the

I
have

they

Like
I
had
lowed
my

with
aggressive

still
on
it.
I
contacted
parts

immediately.
I
had
to
wait
several
days
to
get
a
response
that
told
me
to
wait
another
5
days
for
a

After
returning
the
parts
had
to
wait
about
15
days
to
get
an
email
telling
me
they
took
15%

and
it

be

more.
I
will
not

misfortune.
For

next

be
standard

no

I
didn't
choose
to
spend
an
extra
£5
for
next
day
delivery
and
had
to
wait
4
days
for
the

I

for

They

I
had
ordered
2
items
on
separate
days.
The
first
item
was
ordered
and
shipped
via
Fed
X.
I
was
surprised
to
find
out
Fed
X
took
it
to
the
post
office
for
delivery.
On
checking
with
the
tracking
for
the
post
office,
they
stated
they
tried
to
deliver
the
item
on
a
Saturday
and
left
a
note
that
they
would
attempt
redelivery.
I
received
no
note
or
package.
This
delivery
did
not
require
a
signature
or
anything
and
could
have
been
left
in
the
box
easily.
This
frustrated
me
so
I
sent
a
re
delivery
request
through
the
post
office.
I
did
get
the
package
on
Monday
through
the
USPS.
The
second
item
I
ordered
was
delivered
on
time
via
Fed
X.
I
do
not
understand
why
you
would
choose
2
different
delivery
services
for
one
package.
Our
postal
service
here
stinks
to
high
heaven.
I
would
not
trust
anything
going
through
them.
I
use
either
Fed
X
or
UPS
where
I
know
the
service
is
reliable
and
dependable.
As
far
as
the
parts
go
they
are

contacted

they
just
place

but
I
never

and
no

I
hear
everyone
complain
about

Really?!
With
a
little
research,
approximately
5
minutes,
I
found
the
2
products
i
was
ordering
cheaper
at
2
different
locations.

I
put
in
the
competitors
website
and
saved
60
bucks
and
bought
them
at
one
convenient
location.

Where
else
can
you
do
that?

I
never
order
from
anywhere
else.
I
had
a
very
good
experience
and
will
definitely
use
them
again!

I

I

Didn't

They

Plus
I

then
one
to

Brilliant.
The

You

and

The
price
and

are
clearly
labelled
and
once
setup,
the
checkout
is
fast
and
easy.
I
love
my
onnit
products
that
I
have
and
more
importantly
love
the
timeliness
of
deliveries.

I
receive
my
packages
3
days
after
my
order
is
placed...
oh
and
I
love
the
products
too
I
rang
to
check
stock
as
the
webpage
showed
only
1
in
stock,
they
were
extremely
happy
to
help
and
rang
me
back
with
confirmation
that
they
had
put
a
rucksack
aside
for
me.
I
completed
the
order
online
and
the
transaction
was
trouble
free
and
delivery
was
fast.
I
would
happily
recommend
Taunton

to
anyone
looking
for
quality

I
would
strongly
recommend

to
any
one
who
wants
ultra
quick,
well

The
price
is
very
competitive
which
is
why
I'm
a
repeat

Just
as
I
posted
this
a
few
minutes
ago,
I
saw
through
my
e-mail
that
they
had
sent
the

today
at
12:48
PM.

I
still
think
that
this
ticket
system
is
much
slower
than
a
human
would
have
been.
Easy

Very
pleased
I
ordered

and
I
have
only
received
one.
No
one
can
tell
me
where
the
other
rear
shock
mount
is.
I
was
told
it
was
at
the
post
office.
I
went
there
and
I
was
told
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of
it.
I
want
my
money
back
or
the
part.
Preferably
the
part.
No
one
will
contact
me
back
and
let
me
know
the
status

the

I
am
really
very
angry
with

A
week
later
I
got
a
free
zombie
hunting
permit
sticker
I
placed
an
order
on
Jan
10th
for
an
item
that
showed
as
available
and
ships
in
a
couple
days.

I
received
the
first
notification
of
an
issue
3
days
after
saying
they
expect
the
order
ship
out
in
about
2
weeks.

Then
10
days
later
on
the
23rd
saying
there
was
a
delay
from
the
vendor
and
my
order
would
be
fulfilled
that
day,
or
on
the
13th
of
the
following
month.

I
received
notification
of
shipment
today,
February
6th.

Throughout
this
entire
timespan,
the
website
still
represented
the
item
as
"available"
and
shipping
in
a
couple
days.

If
it
were
not
for
the
good
relationship
I
have
with
my
salesperson,
and
the
proactive
communication
from
STG
customer
serivce,
I
would
have
given
them
2
stars.

My
experience
was
okay
because
speed
of
delivery
was
not
a
factor.

I
made
STG
aware
of
the
misrepresentation
and
yet
the
status
never
changed.

Let
this
be
a
lesson.

If
you
need
something
quickly,
do
not
place
your
order
online.

Call
and
request
a
visual
stock
verification
before
placing
your
order.

The
delay
was
out
of
the
control
of
STG.
HostelWorld
is
a
great
asset
when
you
want
to
find
hostels.
It
charges
a
small

which
is
perfectly

and
the
system
has
so
far
not
failed
me
in
any
ways.
I
like
it
and
would
not
be
without
it
on

the

the

The

I

was
also
the

one
so
there
was
no

unlike
many
other
online

Though

I've

They
didn't

they
had
the

I
wanted

I
don't

I

The
downlightsdirect
Aurora
I9
LED
downlights
were
expensive
but
are
very
high
quality.
They
arrived
promptly
and
were
well
packaged
with
full
instructions.
They
run
cool,
are
easy
to
install,
and
are
well
manufactured.
I
have
since
purchased
more
from
the
same
company.
Highly
recommended.
As
an
aside,
I
previously
ordered
from
ledlights.co.uk
but
returned
the
items
because
they
looked
cheap
and
the
instructions
were
suspiciously
incomplete.
I
have
since
discovered
it's
not
possible
to
leave
bad
feedback
about
ledlights.co.uk!
Packaging
arrived
in
good
order
and
on
time.
Two
items
were
faulty
-
1
had
been
damaged
(presumably
during
manufacture/packaging,
since
the
outer
package
was
not
damaged)
and
1
was
a
manufacturing
error
(a
pin
that
should
have
been
integral
to
a
component
was
missing).
In
both
cases,
I
was
able
to
repair
it
myself,
so
no
harm
done.
However,
one
should
not
expect
ANY
faulty
items/components.
Overall,
I'm
happy
with
the
product
(12ft
trampoline)
and
the
service.
I
was
satisfied
with
the
price
and
ease
of
use
on
the
BoilerJuice
website.
Delivery
was
prompt.
Even
though
I
was
at
home,
the
delivery
driver
did
not
ring
the
door
bell
and
admitted
himself
to
the
rear
garden
to
access
the
tank
without
my
knowledge.
I
subsequently
found
that
he
broke
a
substantial
wooden
structure
for
growing
vegetables,
adjacent
to
the
oil
tank.
I
would
have
understood
and
excused
this
as
an
accident
if
he
had
apologised
or
left
a
note,
but
he
did
neither.
I
called
the
delivery
firm,
who
promised
that
the
duty
manager
would
call
back.
He
didn't.
I
appreciate
that
the
delivery
firm
are
subcontracted
from
BoilerJuice,
but
it's
still
a
poor
customer
interface.
Travelocity
portion
of
the
transaction
was
fine.
I
apologize
for
my
previous
review
(negative).
It
was
not
O2s
fault
at
all,
but
mine.
First
I
gave
a
wrong
number
of
my
mobile
requesting
to
unlatch.
They
wrote
to
me
that
number
doesn't
exist.
Then
I
realized
it
was
wrong
indeed.
Then
I
gave
them
a
number,
but
I
again
realized
few
weeks
later
after
reading
the
'chat'
record,
that
it
was
wrong
too.
Then
I
supplied
the
correct
mobile
number.
Then
they
asked
for
its
IMEI
number,
which
they
said
can
be
found
by
dialing
*#06#
and
I
did
that
with
my
new
phone
without
realizing
that
I
should
have
dialed
the
above
numbers
using
the
old
phone
which
I
needed
unlatching.
So
again
I
provided
a
wrong
number.
Later
on
I
realized
my
mistakes
and
provided
the
correct
details.
Within
minutes
everything
was
sorted.
I
felt
so
ashamed
and
embarrassed.
But
the
customer
care
persons
on
their
'chat'
were
all
extremely
polite
all
the
time.
It
was
completely
my
fault
right
from
the
beginning.
So
readers
please
disregard
my
previous
comment.
I
apologize
unreservedly
to
O2,
and
to
you
readers.
My
order
arrived
the

The
ordering
only
took
me
about
five

I
ordered
an

through
Parts
Geek.
They
shipped
the
wrong

(pn:

and
now
they
expect
me
to

for

I
was
told
that
they
would
e-mail
me
a
prepaid

but
have

It's
their

fix

My
recent
purchase
were
the

Yes
it
was
a

pricy,
but
the
price
is
well
worth
it
i
can
assure
you.
I
ran
a

just
to
see
how
the

would

the

was

is
amazing,
if

you
won't

Only

one
of

I
followed
the
instructions
and
found
that
I
had
to
ship
the
broken

This
is

however
I
am
still
out
the
$12.00

What
should

happened
is
PartsGeek
should
have
sent
me
a

paid
for

as

I
was
even
sent
a

of

which
I
thought
was
a

It
meant
that
they
had
taken
a
moment
to
recognise
that
I
was
a
male
customer,
and
personalised
the

for
me.
The

of

I

-
lets
give

I

the

Brilliance's

They

the

me
to
narrow
the
field.
Their
prices
were
lower
than

on

Lastly,
they
offered
a

discount
for

My
wife
and
I
have
purchased
concert
tickets
through
Ticket
Club
twice
this
year
and
the
process
was
seamless
and
tickets
arrived
quickly
and
hassle
free.

I
shopped
secondary
market
ticket
sites
before
settling
with
Ticket
Club
and
they
offered
me
the

best
deals
on
the
tickets
I
wanted.

This

the
time,

with
your
favorite
bands
and
musicians
of
the
60's,
70's,
and
80's
before
they
stop
touring
forever!
I
love
Travelocity
and
use
them
allot.
If
I
were
to
have
one
thing
I
wish
they
could
do
better
is
offer
additional
discounts
bases
of
how
many
times
you
book
through
the
site.
Similar
to
a
rewards
program.
Other
than
that
they
are
fantastic
and
the
only
site
I
use!!
I
could
not
be
any

with
the

provided.
Keep
up

then
to

was
all
so

An

again.

this

We
are
very
pleased
with
the
sales
and
service
we
have
received
from
Johnny
Walker
RV
(Las
Vegas).

This
was
our
first
RV,
and
they
took
the
time
to
explain
everything
to
us.

Normally
that
would
take
an
hour
or
two,
but
it
took
us
nearly
3
hours.

We
have
had
some
issues
with
the
RV,
but
their
service
department
contacted
the
manufacturer
and
were
able
to
resolve
all
our
issues
under
warranty.

The

$150
just
for

RLE
did
the
same
thing
for
less
than

I
just
sent
in
an
additional
request
to
have
my
reader
lenses
done
as
well.
Picked
up

Although,
I
never

an

with
the

it
arrived
within
2

The

and
the
customer
is
happy.
This
is
the
easiest
way
to
get

no
phoning
around
to
get

no
hanging
about
waiting
for
fitters
to
get
to
your
car
and
you
get
to
choose
the
best
place
to
go
to.
We
had
a
long
wait
to
pick
up
our
hire
car,
after
15
hours
in
a
plane
and
then
wait
an
hour
and
a
half
was
a
bit
over
the
top,
but
we
got
there.
We
were
then
sent
to
a
shed
to
pick
up
our
car
and
no
cars,
we
were
then
directed
to
the
next
larger
model

then
off
we
went.
To

only
n=1

I've

never

whatsoever.
I
find
the

consistently
good
value,
and
the
reward
scheme
is
brilliant.
So

100%
completion!
It
was
overall
definitely
good.
lots
of
products
to
chose
from
and
checkout
was
simple
and
easy
to
use.
I'm
a
fan
of
red
and
black
that's
why
this
coat
was
important
to
me.
However
I
could
not
find
the
coat
without
the
hood.
If
it
could
have
been
remove
able
that
would
be
a
nice
addition
to
the
coat.
The
other
thing
I
would
change
would
be
to
add
an
inside
pocket
for
my
wallet
or
phone.
The
service
was
fantastic
thank
you.
The
last
order
I
placed
took
longer
than
the
other
Ive
placed
in
the
past.
Also
the
box
with
the
mirror
in
it
was
dirty
and
dusty
from
sitting
on
the
shelf.
Then
when
I
opened
the
main
shipping
box,
some
one
put
an
empty
roll
of
tape
in
the
box.
If
the
company
is
going
to
start
getting
sloppy.
I
think
Ill
buy
else
where.

Very
unhappy.....................
Perfect
service,
timing
and
delivery
were
all
met
as
soon
as
I
placed
my
order.

I

for

and

satisfied.

I
would
certainly
use
them
again
My
purchase
was
a
radiator
for
my
2001

My
wife
is
a
bit
peculiar
regarding
the
coffee
she
drinks.

This
was
our
first
order
and
she
wanted
to
return
the
coffee
after
trying
the
first
capsule.


The
process
was
pain
free
and
very
quick.

Definetly
recommend
this
outfit
to
all
my
friends
I
wanted
to
purchase
a
white
ceramic
Chanel
J12
watch
for
my
fiancee
for
Xmas.

After
researching
the
watches
I
only
had
one
concern...size.

It
comes
in
several
diameters
ranging
from
29
mm
up
to
40+mm.

Before
ordering,
I
called
and
spoke
to
a
salesman
and
explained
my
concern.

I
knew
I
didn't
want
the
largest
of
the
watches.

He
asked
me
what
watch
she
was
currently
wearing
and
that
was
a
TAG.

He
told
me
TAGs
were
29
mm
and
that
would
be
my
best
choice.

He
also
said
that
the
29
mm
was
the
most
popular
white
ceramic
Chanel
J12
women's
watch.

That's
what
I
ordered.

messed
things
up.
But
the
guy
behind
the
counter
worked
it
out.
Everyone
was
super
helpful
from
picking
out
the
right
locker
to
helping
me
park
the
truck
for
unloading.
No

Wedding

Was
on
hold
a
lonnnng
time.
The
service
and
response
time
were
great.
My
only
complaint
would
be
in
the
use
of
FedEx
for
shipping.
They
lost
our
part.
But
eEuroparts.com
was
very
responsive
and
shipped
another
to
us
as
quickly
as
possible
and
they
covered
the
cost
of
shipping.
I
have
been
buying
from
supplementwarehouse.com
for
over
5
years
now
and
I've
never
had
a
bad
experience.

They
have
fast
shipping
and
the
best
prices
since
they
beat
any
competitor
by
5%!

I
recommend
them
to
anyone
who
uses
supplements.
Use
H
H
all
the
time
and
always
revive
excellent

service
Found
the
part
I
thought
I
wanted
very
easily,
turned
out
it
was
not
required,
received
a
full
refund
with
no
problems.
Very
professional
people
to
deal
with.
Found
them
cheaper
than
anyone
else,and
just
as
reliable.
Woudl
have
given
them
5
stars
but
they
did
not
rub
the
chalk
marks
off
the
windscreen
Not
an
established
customer,
I
sent
requests
for
quotes
to
fill
an
emergency
requirement
to
Flashbay
and
three
others,
including
my
regular
vendor
for
the
product.

Daniel
Fernandez
was
the
first
to
respond,
the
only
one
who
said
he
could
do
it
in
the
time
given,
and
then
delivered
not
only
as
promised
but
early
and
perfectly.

When
I
place
my
next
order
with
Flashbay,
under
less
critical
circumstances,
I
fully
expect
that
to
top
themselves,
the
items
might
actually
come
by
Unicorn
Express
trailing
glitter
and
wishes.

I
cannot
stress
enough:
a)
not
an
estabished
customer;
b)
a
ridiculously
short
turnaround;
and
c)
delivery
ahead
of
schedule
with
complete
satisfaction.

You
win
Daniel.

You
win
Flashbay.

Even
better,
I
won.

Thanks.
Navigation
is
difficult,
filters
do
not
work
correctly
and
prices
can
change
during
your
search
or
when
you
submit
to
purchase
the
ticket.

I
avoid
using
this
site
at
all
costs
when
buying
airline
tickets.
My
girlfriend
and
I
bought
tickets
at
the
same
time
on
different
computers,
clicked
send
at
the
same
time
and
hers
was
rejected
while
mine
went
through.

The
message
on
her
computer
was
that
the
flight
was
no
longer
available
at
that
price.

It
was
now
$40
more.
If
there
is
any
other
option
available
I
will
use
that
instead
of
this
site.
This
site
sucks.
Delta
flight
from
MSP
was
comfortable
and
modestly

Flight

was
very
courteous.

I
am
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
for
having
found
TransferWise.
I
live
in
London
and
have
to
send
regularly
amounts
of
money
back
home
in
Greece.
With
TransferWise
it's

amazingly
easy
-
plus
I
save
up
so
much
money
from
not
doing
the
transfer
through
my
bank.
I
also
transfer
money
for
use
during
my
holidays;
apparently
the
debit
card
exchange
rates
are
nothing
less
than
a
high
street
robbery.
I
am
a
man
of
few
words,
but
I
must
say
that
WCS
wasa
pleasure
to
do
business
with.
Great
products,
low
prices,
fast
shipping,
and
great
customer
service!
I
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
shop
while
shopping
for
my
safety
razor.
Found
it
to
be
a

one
stop
shop
for
quality
items.
Stuff
that
was
hard
to
find
was
all
here.
They
were
priced
well
and
convent
for
me.
Really
Happy.
I
typically
use
a
different
airport
parking
company
every
time
I
go
to
Newark
Airport,
about
once
a
year.
I
just
interenet
search
"Newark
Airport
parking,
pick
one
and
go.
I
will
remeber
Newark
Airport
Long
Term
Parking
for
next
time.
They
were
very
easy
to
get
to,
and
pck
up
and
drop
off
was
very
fast
and
efficient.
My
car
was
waiting
for
me
me
with
the
trunk
open
and
ready
to
go.
It
is
a
verry
simple
site
and
it
really
works
Very
efficient
and
easy
to
use.
I
will
use
this
service
every
time
over
the
normal
carparks
I
ordered
from
SupplementMarket.com,
and
received
the
supplements
in
a
timely
fashion.
However,
when
the
shipment
came,
I
noticed
that
one
of
the
products
was
not
the
same
as
the
one
I
ordered.
I
called
them,
and
somehow
their
"answering
message"
girl
picked
up,
told
me
that
the
office
people
might
be
busy
so
the
call
got
diverted
to
their
answering
service.
I
told
her
my
problem,
and
she
took
down
my
name
and
number,
to
forward
it
to
the
"office"
staff,
and
they
would
call
me
back.
Waited
a
day,
and
no
call
back.
The
next
day
I
called
again,
and
surprise,
the
"answering"
girl
picked
up,
with
the
same
line
"
give
me
your
contact
info"
and
we
will
get
back
to
you.
I
explained
to
her
it
was
my
second
time
calling,
and
gave
her
the
info
again.
4
hours
go
by,
its
coming
close
to
end
of
business
day,
and
still
no
call
back.
I
called
them
again
a
THIRD
time,
and
surprise,
surprise,
the
answering
girl
picks
up
with
the
same
line.
I
got
fed-up
with
trying
to
reach
them,
CC
company
will
be
notied
for
a
swift
dispute.
They
hire
answering
machine
people
just
to
take
messages??
Would
it
be
easier,
and
quicker
if
the
answering
machine
operators
took
care
of
consumer
problems??
I
suspect
that
they
have
a
very
poorly
run
operation
with
one
person
answering
phones,
and
the
other
shipping
items.
They
communication
and
customer
service
is
the
lowest.
I
gave
them
not1,
not
2
but
3
chances
to
make
it
right,
but
they
will
not
listen.
I
am
an
active
member
of
several
fitness
and
bodybuilding
boards,
and
I
will
make
my
reviews
about
this
company
known
to
their
customer
base.

Good
product.
Used
site
to
diagnose
fault
on
triton
shower,
phoned
to
order
part
and
sales
staff
went
through
problem
with
me
and
offered
other
advice
due
to
living
in
hard
water
area.
Part
was
the
cheapest
i
could
find
it
anywhere
even
including
postage
and
arrived
within
two
days.
Fitted
part
and
cleaned
filters
as
per
advice
and
shower
worked
as
new.
A
new
shower
would
have
cost
me
upwards
of
£100
total
repair
£14
pound
plus
half
an
hour
of
my
time.
Thanks
shower
doctor.
Liked
the
pattern,
delivery
was
quick.
Found
the
sticker
was
difficult
to
separate
from
the
paper
backing,
took
a
few
minutes
and
found
the
sticker
itself
a
bit
thinner
than
a
previous
one
I
had
from
Gelaskin.
When
so
many
online
PSN
card
sellers
are
questionable
at
best,
it's
great
to
have
one
that
I
know
to
be
trustworthy.

Thanks
so
much!
Like
the
last
reviewer
said...you
cant
beat
cheap...and
I
agree!!!
I
absolutely
love
this
boutique!
The
clothes
are
super
cute
and
trendy,
and
the
staff
helped
me
put
together
some
amazing
outfits.
Easy
to
find
and
easy
to
Park
Ordered
an
oil
pan
first
and
was
really
surprised
in
came
in
2
days
after
I
ordered
it.
I
was
impressed.
Then
I
forgot
to
order
a
gasket
so
I
ordered
one
and
it
never
came.
I
waited
over
10
days.

No
explanation
why
they
just
gave
me
my
money
back.
To
me
thats
bad
business.
I
have
ordered
parts
from
them
before
with
no
problem
and
will
probably
order
from
them
again
but
would
still
like
to
know
why
I
couldn't
get
a
simple
gasket
when
I
ordered
one.
I
have
been
ordering
from
Express
Medical
for
nine
years.

They
have,
without
exception,
filled
every
order
accurately
and
very
quickly.

If
I
order
on
Monday
morning,
the
order
is
at
my
front
door
on
Wednesday.

I
can't
say
enough
good
things
about
this
company.

Thanks
so
much
for
making
my
life
a
little
easier
!
I
have
tried
many
types
and
brands
of
protein
and
i
can
100%
say
TheProteinWorks
is
the
best
tasting
by
far!
I
would
massively
recommend
the
caramel
macchiato,
butterscotch
ripple
and
cherry
bake
well
flavours.
I
have
also
tried
the
jaffa
cake
flavour,
however,
i
found
the
taste
too
orangey
for
my
liking.
other
than
that,
cannot
fault
this
new
protein
company!
Was
a
bit
suspicious
when
I
realized
this
was
from
a
Spanish
website
despite
me
searching
for
uk
sites
only
BUT
the
product
arrived
from
the
uk
in
record
time.
Overall
a
good
service
and
purchase!
Pen
geeks
heaven,
looking
forward
to
my
next
purchase!
Good
price
but
not
received
my
goods
yet
I
only
had
a
problem
once
(my
connection
was
very
weak)
and
I
payed
twice
for
an
hostel
that
was
only
booked
once.
They
quickly
refunded
me
and
there
were
no
problems
at
all.
every
order
fast
and
right
well
pleased
changed
size
no
fuss
and
arrived
fast
with
the
postie
top

Our
only
problem
with
the
pods
is
their
recyclability
in
the
US.
The
coffee
quality
is
excellent.
Bought
a
bunch
of
stuff
from
Onnit.
Very
happy
with
the
whole
experience.
Tried
a
bunch
of
stuff
supplements,
food,
and
bought
some
equipment.
Very
happy
with
Kettlebells.
So
far,
pull
up
bar
is
great.
Warrior
bars
superb.
Green
stuff
pretty
good.
Kettlebell
DVD
really
good.
It
would
be
great
if
there
were
an
iphone
app
companion
for
charting
workouts.
Cool
to
do
at
home
but
I
can't
always
remember
the
routines
when
I
go
out
somewhere.
Don't
know
if
I
noticed
too
much
benefit
from
other
supplements
I
tried
except
the
New
Mood
made
me
sleep
really
well.
It's
a
little
too
early
to
tell
but
after
the
first
couple
times
using
T+
Natural
Testosterone
Booster
this
crazy
debilitating
pain
in
my
back
seems
to
have
disappeared
as
well
as
bags
under
my
eyes
almost
entirely
gone.
Only
been
taking
it
for
a
couple
of
days.
Kind
of
weird
actually
but
cool.
I
also
feel
very
calm.
I'm
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
effects
it
has
after
using
it
longer.
I
have
ordered
several
electronic
items
from
N1
and
each
experience
has
been
great.
Purchases
arrive
in
a
timely
manner
and
in
great
working
order.
I
have
never
had
a
payment
or
price
dispute.
If
you
are
looking
for
a
great
way
to
shop
from
the
couch
N1
is
the
way
to
go!!!!
I
bought

...
not
very
happy.
As
above,
but
company
very
concered
about
the
problem,
with
follow
up
e-mail
and
phone
call.
Would
have
been
5
stars

except
for
the
initial
problem
The
contact
with
the
company
was
very
good,
keeping
me
informed
of
the
position
of
my
order.
The
product
arrived
before
the
expected
time.
So
very
happy
with
the
service.
Here's
a
group
that
ups
the
ante
when
it
comes
to
service
and
quality.
Got
exactly
what
I
wanted
when
I
needed
it
-
what's
so
hard
about
that?
Not
a
lot
of
companies
deliver
on
what
they
promise.
Buttons
for
our
friends
wedding
were
the
talk
of
the

Can't
think
of
any
reason
not
to
use
them
again.
Great

Service

easy,
I
refer

I
personally
enjoyed
the
service.
At
the
start
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
scammed
due
to
not
knowing
this
website,
but
had
to
risk
since
i
was
in
need.
In
less
than
15
minutes
i
had
my
order
aprooved
and
delivered.

Ordered

Job

Cannot
fault
the
service.
I've
made
a
transfer
to
a
company
in
China,
had
confirmation
from
Xendpay
that
the
transfer
has
been
completed
but
my
payee
still
has
no
record
of
receiving
the
money
a
week
later.
Took
3
days
to
get
a
swift
statement
(which
I
am
not
sure
whether
this
proves
the
money
has
been
transferred
or
not..)
so
as
it
stands
I
don't
know
whether
Xendpay
are
inefficient
or
the
fault
is
with
my
payee.
A
previous
payment
had
been
cancelled
before
the
funds
had
left
the
Xendpay
account
but
there
is
no
sign
of
me
having
this
credited
yet
despite
confirmation
that
the
payment
hadn't
gone
through.
Overall
not
sure
about
this
company,
as
it
stands
my
business
is
suffering
due
to
the
uncertainty
with
the
location
of
my

JUST
FINE!!!!
I
thought
I
was
ordering
a
pair
of
gloves.

Boo,
on
me
for
not
reading
the
fine
print.

When
I
looked
back
on
the
page
where
I
made
the
order,
it
did
state
one
spot
that
the
order
was
for
one
glove.

Boo,
on
HalloweenCostumes.com
for
being
misleading.

The
"one
glove"
fine
print
should
have
more
apparent.

Who
orders
only
one
glove?

Could
you
imagine
ordering
only
one
shoe?

Also,
there
is
no
where
to
indicate
if
someone
wants
a
right
or
left
glove.

This
would
have
been
a
fair
indicator/notice
that
I
would
only
get
one
glove.

I
decided
to
go
to
local
costume
store
to
avoid
getting
another
right
glove.

I
take
online
ordering
seriously
because
companies
easily
rip
people
off
with
fees,
misleading
descriptions,
and
restocking
fees.

I
tell
everyone
about
how
HalloweenCostumes.com
is
misleading.
Based
on
my
medical

I

for

laptop..
It
was
my

I
had
always
taken
it
into

After
a

I
decided
to
give

and
do

work
myself...

They
were

and
very
patient
with
guiding
me
through
the
process.
I
was
also
shocked
by
the

I

I
compared

the
best,
but
maybee
once
they
added

They
should
show
the

or
better
still
make
it
free!

But
I
would
still
buy
from
them
,
my

the
next

after

I
also

Fantastic

As
above
ordered
a
small
package
on
Sunday
night.
By
friday
nothing
had
arrived
so
rang
the
helpline.
The
operator
(oaidric?
was
very
helpful.
Explained
that
my
order
got
stuck
in
the
system
and
wasn't
delivered.
In
fairness
I
had
it
delivered
that
afternoon
but
would
be
sceptical
about
the
efficiency
of
future
orders.
The
product
is
great,
but
what
makes
this
company
a
true
diamond
in
the
rough
is
the
people.
I
have
rarely
found
any
company
with
a
staff

not
only
goes
the
extra
mile
but
actually
does

cheerfully.

If
you're
in

Ordered
a
Chevy
Grill
assembly
for
a
2500HD
Silverado,
The
parts
list
showed
that
a
1500
grill
would
fit.
It
does
fit,
but
it
is
not
the
same
size
as
one
for
a
2000HD
series.
I
felt
the
parts
lists
was
misleading.
The
quality
of
the
part
was
excellent
and
came
with
the
correct
type

I
was
about
to
purchase
the
18v
combi
drill
and
jigsaw
set
from
another
well
known
mainly
mail
order
company.

When
I
thought
I'd
check
online
that
there
weren't

any
other
companies
that
were
able
to
offer
better
value.

To
my
surprise
I
found
the
same
specification
for
£75
less
on
Power
Tools
UK.

Once
I
had
discovered
this
saving
I
began
to
browse
other
tools
to
compare
their
specifications
and
prices.

Not
only
did
I
find
many
consistently
lower
prices,
but
also
many
more
products
for
example
bare
units
to
go
with
the
batteries
that
my
previously
well
known
and
used
supplier
does
not
stock.

My
only
disappointment
is
that
I
didn't
discover
Power
Tools
UK
along
time
ago.

I
will
certainly
mention
their
name
to
other
workers
who
like
myself
may
have
been
sticking
to
other
online
suppliers
without
being
aware
of
how
much
more
variety
and
impressive
savings
can
be
made
with
Power
Tools
UK.
I
found
the
part
I
needed
for
my
shower
on
the
site
by
entering
the
make
and
model
of
my
shower
to
find
the
detailed
exploded
view
of
my
shower.

This
made
the
selection
of
the
correct
part
straightforward.

When
I
phoned
to
check
what
may
have
been
wrong
with
the
shower
(as
I
am
a
carpenter
not
electrian
or
plumber)
the
detailed
advice
I
was
given
saved
me
ordering
any
unnecessary
additional
parts
and
my
shower
is
now
working.
Would
come
back
time
and
again.
Great
service!

I
ordered
an
olympic

and
2
olympic
15kg
rubber
covered

discs.
Both
items
arrived
in
a
couple
of
days
and
were
delivered

I
shopped
around
on
the
internet
before
purchase
and
could
not
find
anywhere
else
that
could
match
or
beat
price
and
delivery.
I
have
not

built

as
it
is

from

i

in

My
order

on

and
was

It

the
next
4
days
of
going
back

forth
with
emails
and
phone
calls
to
rectify
the
problem.
The

AND
RECEIVED

IN

AND
THEN
I
NOTICED
A
FLAW
AND
RETURNED
THEM
FOR

AND
EVERYTHING
FELL-APART,
I
TOLD
THEM
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
(IN

BEFORE
I
SENT

BACK,
THEN
I
GOT
AN

ALREADY
GIVEN

This

was
great.
My

guide
picked
me
up
from
the
hotel
and
away
we
went
on
the
tour.
My
guide
was
sooo
informative.
I
learned
so
much.
And
the
plus
is
that
I
went
by
myself
and
met
so
many
new
people
(who
was
on
the
tour
with
me).
You
know
I
find
myself
going
on
this
tour
again.
It
was
just
to
good
to
keep
it
to
myself.
I
have
to
share
this
experience
with
my
friends.

to
say

was

picture
on
the
Partmaster
website
I
was
assured
this
was
just
a
stock
picture
and
they
would
send
me
the
correct
part
so
I
ordered
it
but
when
it
arrived
it
was
wrong
id
even
included
a
photo
of
the
original
pin
type
connector
not
micro
USB
type
that
they
sent
me
I
have
since
returned
it
for
a
refund
and
will
have
to
search
elsewhere
for
the
correct
lead
I
need.
Ordered
a
new
glove
box
catch
which
was
a
good
match
for
a
pattern
part
no
problem
fitting
it
cant
knock
it
for
such
a
cheap
price.
I
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
Chemical
Records
is
an
average
website
with
average
customer
services.
Since
signing
up
roughly
3
years
ago,
I
have
had
a
couple
of
bad
experiences
that
have
left
me
rather
unimpressed
with
their
overall
service
and
I
now
favour
other
websites
such
as
Red
Eye
Records
or
Sounds
of
the
Universe
etc.
(There
are
many
others.)
who
have
impeccable
customer
services.
The
last
issue
I
had
I
decided
not
to
bother
raising
with
their
customer
services
after
how
I
was
treated
on
the
previous
occasion.
On
one
occasion,
I
inquired
as
to
returning
a
package
as
I
wasn't
happy
with
the
condition
that
it
had
arrived
to
me
(No
inserts/stiffeners.
Although
the
handling
by
the
postal
service
is
also
to
blame
(Footprints
on
the
mailer
etc.
I
have
photos.).)
and
was
told
to
return
the
package
as
if
this
wouldn't
be
a
problem.
However,
upon
contacting
them,
a
senior
member
of
staff
told
me
that
he
couldn't
see
any
problem
with
the
records
and
thus
I
would
have
to
pay
for
them
to
be
returned
to
me
again.
My
problem
here
is
with
their
communication
between
members
of
their
team
and
also
with
customers.
If
I
had
known
that
a
replacement
or
refund
was
only
conditional
I
would
have
considered
my
situation
more
but
as
it
stood
the
member
of
staff
assured
me
and
seemed
to
take
my
side
readily.
Poor
communication.
The
senior
member
of
staff
went
on
to
practically
accuse
me
of
ordering
the
vinyl
just
to
rip
them
onto
a
digital
format
and
return
them
to
get
my
money
back,
despite
having
been
a
loyal
customer,
giving
them
what
must
have
amounted
to
hundreds
of
pounds
over
the
years.
I
felt
like
my
loyalty
to
them
meant
nothing
and
to
be
fair
it
probably
didn't
as
I
am
aware
of
their
ongoing
popularity
and
success.
The
senior
member
of
staff
admitted
that
the
package
wasn't
packaged
properly
without
any
stiffeners/inserts
("Packers
are
told
they
are
meant
to
put
them
in")
but
i
was
offered
no
apology
or
compensation
for
this.
Some
orders
since
have
also
come
without
stiffeners/inserts,
so
the
problem
has
clearly
not
be
dealt
with.
The
last
order
I
made
with
them,
one
of
the
records
arrived
with
the
paper
sleeve
ripped
down
the
middle
(Being
a
single,
it
was
only
in
a
single
paper
sleeve,
this
is
common
throughout
the
industry.)
and
the
exposed
part
of
the
record
covered
in
surface
scratches.
I
was
told
on
the
other
occasion
that
their
standards
meet
industry
standards,
but
that
particular
record
is
definitely
worse
off
than
you
would
find
for
sale
as
first-hand
in
a
record
shop.
I
didn't
bother
to
raise
this
as
I
felt
it
would
get
me
nowhere.
When
I
have
tried
to
use
their
"Contact
Us"
service,
I
have
also
found
I
have
been
ignored
in
the
past.
For
such
reasons,
I
now
try
to
avoid
the
stress
of
using
the
website,
worrying
about
what
condition
my
purchase
will
arrive
in.
To
be
fair
though,
they
are
comparatively
quite
cheap
and
perhaps
this
is
where
the
true
crux
of
the
matter
lies.
If
you
want
peace
of
mind,
I
advise
you
to
pay
the
extra
and
try
another
service
if
you
have
had
similar
experiences.
You
will
be
better
off
for
it.
Purchase
wise
and
sanity
wise,
knowing
that
your
records
have
been
packaged
correctly
and
that
you
can
contact
a
service
team
that
you
can
put
more
faith
in.
I
have
found
much
better
service
from
other
online
record
retailers
that
clearly
value
my
custom.
I
have
been
buying
from
B&H
for
over
a
decade
and
have
only
had
excellent
experiences
with
them.
I've
been
with
Express
Medical
for
over
4
yrs
now.
The
customer
service
is
great,
never

have
any
trouble
ordering
or
needing
to
return
an
item.
I've
placed

orders
and
been
shipped
out
same
day
or
next.
Online
ordering
is
just
as
great
no
problems
with
it
either.
I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
who
is
needing
any
kind
of
medical
supplies.

Great
experience.
Very
reassuring
to
get
an
immediate
e-mail
confirmation
that
the
order
was
accepted
-
even
on
an
evening.
Notification
of
despatch
was
equally
as
efficient
and
the
goods
arrived
in
perfect
condition
and
in
super
quick

Informed
at
every
stage
and
even
sent
me
a
proper

old

of
the
kind

Don't

Shipping

was
ridiculous.
I
had
to
badger
them
in
order
to
get
my
refund
after
a
month
and
a
half.
I
wish
someone
would

It
was
very

Just

Will

Thank
you.
You
know
being
on
the

of
the
world,
I
honestly
thought
I
had
done
my
money
and
the
goods
had
not
been
sent
or
were
lost
in
transit.
I
have
ordered
from

at

2

3

Always

A
friend
of
mine
introduced
me
to
Supplement
Warehouse
a
year
or
so
ago,
ranting
about
their
low
prices
and
nearly
endless
options
of
free
items
with
every
order.
I've
never
been
one
to
wait,
so
ordering
supplements
was
ordinarily
out
of
the
question
for
me,
but
I
somehow
found
myself
on
the
site
and
I
haven't
gotten
my
supplements
from
anywhere
else
since.
Not
only
are
the
prices
lower,
the
service
is
also
great.
I
also
like
that
I
can
check
out
reviews
on
most
any
supplement
right
there
on
the
site.
I
still
hate
waiting,
but
Supplement
Warehouse
does
a
great
job
of
keeping
me
from
having
to
do
that
with
their
excellent
shipping
times.
A
couple
of
weeks
ago
I
found
myself
in
a
supplement
store
at
a
mall
with
a
buddy
checking
out
prices,
and
I
couldn't
help
but
to
laugh
out
loud
at
the
ridiculous
prices
after
seeing
what
I
can
pay
at
Supplement
Warehouse.
This
place
is
hands
down
the
best
out
there.
Although
I
was
a
bit
worried
at
first
about
ordering
from
Digital
Rev
I
shouldn't
have
been.
I've
ordered
several
items
from
DV247
and
each
time
they
have
been
dispatched
extremely
quickly.
I
received
excellent
service
from
GAK.
Within
minutes
of
placing
my
order
online
I
received
a
call
from
one
of
their
team
offering
to
give
me
a
better
price!
Unfortunately
the
order
had
already
gone
through
so
this
couldn't
happen
but
the
fact
they
even
bothered
to
ring
was
beyond
what
I
would
expect.
The
product
arrived
first
thing
the
next
day,
as
well
as
the
free
gift
(10ft
Venom
cable).
Got
part
almost
50%
less
than
all
other
sites.
Showed
up
at
the
last
minute
with
a
flat
and
a
donut
on
my
wife's
SUV.

They
fixed
it
quickly
and
as
expected.

Put
everything
away
for
me
that
I
had
out
to
put
the
spare
on
(i.e.
Jack,
spare,
etc).

can't
be
beat!
Thanks
supplementwarehouse!
The
purchase
of
a
Gree
18000
BTU
heat
pump
was
easy
and
very
reasonable.
The
unit
arrived
via
truck
within
6
days,
KY
to
CA!
What
up!
I
bought
a
set
of
megan
racing
EZ
street
coilovers
for
my
daily
driven
CG2
from
Pro
Import
Tuners
I'm
very
happy
with
my
purchase
great
service
and
my
car
handles
with
great
response
on
mountain
turns
up
hill
and
down
hill
I
live
near
hwy
74
so
I
took
my
car
for
a
drive
and
I
was
impressed
at
how
I
was
able
to
lock
into
every
turn
and
safely
accelerate
with
no
problem
I
don't
race
my
accord
but
I
do
like
a
more
aggressive
suspension
because
I
drive
up
and
down
mountains
all
the
time
for
work
and
now
I
realize
how
much
of
a
difference
it
can
make
thanx
for
the
coilovers
and
friendly
service
I
would
suggest
Pro
Import
Tuners
to
my
family
and
friends.
From
the
day
I
ordered
I
got
my
set
3
days
later
in
perfect
condition
Thanx
Pro
Import
tuners
!
I
never
have
a
problem
with
ordering
or
recieving
parts
from
parts
geek....
I've
been
buying
from
BTD
since
2006
and
have
probably
spent
over
$10,000
with
them
on
everything
from
tires
to
clothing
to
food.

I
rarely
have
had
issues,
but
when
I
do
they
are
taken
care
of
promptly
and
appropriately.

And
in
my
experience
it
is
hard
to
beat
their
prices,
especially
if
you
are
a
regular
like
me.
All
parts
arrived
on
time
and
in
great
condition.
They
fit
perfecly.
I
recently
purchased
the
'My
Child
Coupe
Rocker/Walker
for
my
Great
Granddaughter.
I
was
initially
surprised
that
it
was
everything
that
the
advert
had
described.
It
was
delivered
within
a
few
days
of
the
purchase.
1st
recieved
a
part
that
does'nt
match
correctly
to
the
origional
Supplement
Warehouse
has
everything
you
could
possibly
need
in
the
way
of
nutritional
supplements
and
wellness
products.

The
shipping
is
a
little
more
expensive
than
other
on-line
retailers,
but
with
the
"price
adjust"
feature
you
can
make
up
for
that,
and
the
shipping
is
extremely
fast.

Best
place
to
go
for
your
supplementation
needs!
I
ordered
a
side
mirror
for
my
wife's
Ford
Focus,
it
came
in
really
fast
and
looked
good,
but
OOPS,
we
ordered
the
wrong
mirror
and
had
to
return
it
for
an
exchange
for
the
right
one.
Hopefully
I'll
get
it
right
this
time.
My
advice
to
everybody
is
read
the
part
description
very
carefully
before
you
order
and
save
yourself
some
money
on
returned
parts.
Perfect
match
for
my
laptop,
fast
shipping!
We
ended
up
getting
our
full
refund
back
on
our
warranty,
but
there
was
alot
of
hassle
involved.
We
weren't
told
up
front
when
we
needed
to
have
our
computer
inspected
that
if
it
was
condemned
by
local
techs
we
would
need
to
send
it
for
verification.
Had
we
known
this
we
would
have
just
sent
it
in
the
first
place
and
saved
the
hassle
of
having
it
inspected
locally.
Emails
were
lost
on
our
account...
calls
needed
to
be
made,
etc..
Like
I
said,
we
did
end
up
with
our
money,
but
it
was
a
month
long
process
and
I'm
just
not
sure
I'll
do
it
again.
Everything
I
ordered
was
shipped
fast.

A
great
selection
of
parts.

No
problems
all
all
I
highly
recommend
partsgeek
The
service
was
excellent.
I
received
my
ankle
support
in
one
day.
It
is
a
quality
product,
works
great
and
at
a
fair
price.
I
definitely
would
recommend
this
sight.
Very
easy
transaction.
Fast
shipping
will
do
business
with
them
again.
I
rang
Homeserve
and
was
told
that
a
repair
was
authorised.

One
small
problem
was
that
I
did
not
receive
a
telephone
call
as
promised
to
tell
me
when
the
help
would
arrive.
After
speaking
to
an
assistant
I
placed
an
order
which
was
despatched
immediately.
The
staff
was
really
helpful
and
friendly.
The
course
was
challenging
and
in
good
condition.
It
was
an
enjoyable
experience.
Happy
and
super
fast!
I
would
say
overall
I
would
use
their
service
again
but
they
could
improve
I
placed
an
order
for
two
different
items.
Later
I
received
an
e-mail
stating
that
my
order
was
cancelled
because
of
a
backorder.
Even
when
I
logged
on
to
my
account,
there
were
no
details
on
what
was
backordered-
one
or
both
items?
I
placed
another
order
for
the
part
I
really
needed
and
it
went
through
OK.
I
suggest
that
PartsGeek
include
detailed
info,
and
that
info
should
be
included
in
the
e-mail
notification.
Otherwise,
my
second
order
was
processed,
shipped
and
delivered
quickly.
I
would
recommend
the
mobile
service
based
on
my
experience.
well
worth
checking,
I
have
purchased
many
things
from
simply
scuba
and
have
had
no
trouble
whatsoever.Quick
deliveries
and
information
overall
very
satisfied
with
their
company.
With
an
easy
to
follow
guide,
I
was
able
to
buy
the
ps3
card
I
wanted
to,
without
having
to
leave
my
house,
and
even
had
a
phone
confirmation
to
check
that
I
was
using
my
own
credit
card,
I
loved
it.
The
product
was
well
described
on
the
website
and
the
service
was
quick.
Great
way
to
recycle
phones
and
make
maximum
use
of
limited
resources.

Logical,
efficient,
timely
service
that
works
exactly
as
expected.

Great
to
see
a
simple
system
that
makes
sense
and
is
fair
to
all
parties.

Makes
trading
up
to
a
new
phone
less
expensive.
Constant
emails
confirming
status
of
everything,
professional
staff
answered
all
of
my
questions
when
I
called
for
assistance,
money
deposited
very
promptly,
no
issues,
all
happened
within
a
week.
I
have
been
ordering
from
Big
Apple
Florist
for
a
couple
of
years
now.
Customer
service
is
very
professional
and
courteous,
the
delivery
guy
is
very
nice
and
the
bouquets
are
amazing.
Highly
recommended!!!
I
got
my
lenses
today,
thank
you
very
much.
The
only
down
side
was
that
the
box
didn't
fit
through
my
mailbox
(not
by
much
to
be
honest)
I
ordered
a
pair
of
Marc
by
Marc
Jacobs
sunglasses
from
Vision
Direct
after
doing
some
research
for
the
best
place
to
purchase
designer
sunglasses
online
in
Australia.
While
I
was
impressed
by
the
discount
on
the
sunglasses
I
was
absolutely
appalled
by
the
length
of
unnecessary
time
for
shipment.
I
have
bought
items
from
Appliances
Online
on
two
occasions.
It
was
incredibly
easy
to
book
my
hostels
from
this
site,
there
weren't
many
pages
to
go
to,
all
i
had
to
do
was
confirm
what
i
wanted
and
put
in
my
details.
The
page
was
easy
to
navigate
and
i
could
change
the
currency
from
Euros
to
Pounds
which
was
very
handy.
I
have
been
searching
for
this
parts
for
my
truck
and
couldn't
find
it
anywhere
until
I
found
parts
Geek.



Thank
you.
It
is
nice
to
finally
have
found
a
service
that
saves
me
time.

The
selections
in
the
area
I
need
are
at
my
finger
tips
-
no
more
searching
and
price-shopping.

I
can
see
at-a-glance
premium
choices
to
stay
and
stay
within
my
budget.

Transactions
are
completed
and
I
have
all
the
paperwork
I
need
from
check-in
to
expense
report
before
I
leave
for
the
trip.

On
an
occasion
where
I
needed
to
change
dates,
within
24
hours,
my
mutiple
itinerary
was
changed
and
new
paperwork
sent
to
me.
Price
was
great
as
was
the
product.
If
fit
perfectly.

I'll
keep
them
on
my
speed
dial
for
the
future.
Great
deal
great
car
everything
was
as
promised
Had
a
few
delays
my
end
and
envirofone
were
good
to
wait
and
hold
the
offer.
Money
received
on
time
and
a
very
competitive
price
I've
been
using
jAlbum
for
years
-
ever
since
somewhere
around
version
1.4.


At
the
time,
and
even
since
then,
I
haven't
found
a
website
builder
that
meets
my
needs
any
closer
thant
jAlbum
does.

Easy
and
intuitive
to
use
and
you
can
create
many
different
looks
for
it.

Myself,
I
was
after
something
that
friends/family
didn't
have
to
scroll
through
100's
of
my
photos
just
to
get
to
the
few
they
wanted
to
see.

I'm
able
to
easily
organize
the
main
page
into
topics
(my
different
travel
adventures,
etc.)
an
d
when
they
click
on
one,
they
get
a
page
full
of
all
the
thumbnails
of
the
trip/topic.


From
there
they
can
show
/download
individual
enlarged
photos
or
do
a
slideshow.

It's
perfect
for
my
needs
and
only
takes
me
a
few
minutes
to
get
a
new
trip
up
on
my
website.

Also,
the
"smart
upload"
once
you've
built
your
webpage
on
the
host
saves
a
TON
of
time.

Really,
really
quick
to
just
upload
the
differences.
The
only
issue
I
had
was
the
installation.

I
can't
remember
which
step,
but
one
of
the
steps
said
something
like
"tap
the
ring
on".

I
beat
the
heck
out
of
that
and
it
NEVER
even
came
close
to
going
on.

I
went
to
ACE
hardware
and
got
a
PVC
3"
drain
and
cut
the
"drain"
part
out
and
used
that
to
"Tap"
the
retaining
rings
into
place.

Other
than
that,
great
service.
So,
I
broke
the
screen
of
my
brand
new
Galaxy
S5.
When
I
notified
Square
Trade,
we
found
out
Samsung
doesn't
even
offer
replacement
screens
yet.
I
freaked,
I
can't
survive
without
my
phone.
The
customer
service
representative
calmed
me
down
and
told
me
to
go
out
and
find
a
replacement
locally,
get
it
repaired
and
forward
the
invoice
to
them
for
reimbursement.
I
found
a
local
repair
shop,
paid
the
outrageous
sum
and
immediately
forwarded
the
invoice
to
Square
Trade.
When
I
checked
my
email
less
than
an
hour
later,
the
money
had
already
been
deposited
into
my
PayPal
account.
Unbelievable
customer
service
and
attention
to
detail.
Oh
yea,
to
compensate
me
for
all
the
hassle,
they
even
waived
the
$99
deductible.
I'll
never
insure
an
electronic
device
with
anyone
else
!!!
I've
been
using
Chris
for
the
past
3
years
and
wouldn't
think
of
sourcing
elsewhere!
his
quality
and
speed
of
delivery
is
second
to
none.
On
time
delivery
of
healthy
bees!

Should
be
great!
Easy
to
deal
with
-
great
part
-
you
helped
to
save
me
over
$100
from
dealer
cost!!
My
order
was
expedite
faster
than
I
thought,however
as
product
quality
goes,time
will
tell.So
far
works
good.
Ordered
my
infant
stethoscope
(Littmann)
from
Medisave
having
browsed
a
few
sellers
-
they
offer
a
good
range
of
equipment
&
at
decent
prices.
Stethoscope
was
delivered
promptly
&
packaged
well
(with
nice
free
gifts
of
tape
measure
&
pen
torch).
No
complaint!
Have
only
sampled
a
few
of
various
proteins
on
the
market,
but
am
very
happy
with
my
recent
purchase
of
total
protein.
Have
previously
tended
to
grab
whey
due
to
being
conveniently
available,
but
this
is
much
more
what
I
need
-
evening
workouts
means
this
mix
covers
my
recovery
through
the
night
too.
Very
efficient
deliver
and
great
cost
even
for
the
next
day
option.
Will
certainly
be
returning
customer.
Fast,
cheap,
great
service!
Very
fast
delivery,
great
service
and
wonderful
choice
of
Footwear,
there's
something
for
everybody
on
this
site!
I'v
ordered
from
this
site
3
times
now
because
of
the
wide
variety
of
shirts
and
designs.
The
shirts
are
American
Apparel
and
normally
they
aren't
cheap,
especially
the
plain
baseball
tees
which
are
normally
£24
each
if
you're
buying
elsewhere
but
redbubble
sells
them
for
about
£17-£19
plus
a
design
printed
which,
to
me,
feels
like
getting
my
moneys
worth.
Love
this
site,
the
designs
and
the
quality
of
the
shirts.
I
have
ordered
from
this
store
several
times
and
their
prices
and
delivery
services
are
simply
top-notch,
they
have
a
great
selection
of
clothes
to
browse
from
and
would
definitely
buy
from
them
again
if
anything
I
like
crops
up
on
their
site!
I
also
understand
that
the
site
is
under
new
management
so
I'm
looking
forward
to
see
any
improvements
to
an
already
perfect
service!
Bought
some
Emerica
Jeans
which
were
reduced
from
£45
to
£12.50,
they're
amazing
value!
Delivery
was
hassle
free
too,

even
at
Royal
Mail
2nd
Class.

Overall,
very
happy
with
UrbanSurfer
and
will
definitely
shop
again
from
their
wide
selection
of
shoes!
Ordered
a
lucky
box
which
had
a
selection
of
5
random
shirts
only
for
£20,
amazing
shirts
at
amazing
value!
Would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
interested
in
a
fine
selection
of
rock
clothing.
This
is
my
second
time
using
SpareFoot
to
rent
a
storage
unit
and
I
am
so
happy
with
it!
It
showed
me
all
of
my
options
and
the
price
range
for
each.
Such
a
great
way
to
find
the
perfect
storage
unit!
Mavic
Ksyrium
Elite
Wheels
-
great
purchase,
fast
delivery
&
great
price!
They
were
great
about
answering
all
questions
I
asked
(and
I
asked
a
lot).
The
checkout
process
was
very
smooth,
and
the
diamond
I
purchased
was
exactly
to
the
specs
it
had
listed.
I
would
definitely
shop
here
again.
I
found
VioVet
to
be
the
best
online
price
for
dog
food.

The
delivery
was
very
speedy

with
a
one
hour
time
slot
by
text.

I
would
recommend
VioVet
to
anyone.
After
placing
my
order
they
contacted
me
to
explain
that
to
meet
my
full
my
oder
I
would
have
to
wait
a
further
7
days.

I
was
asked
"do
I
wish
to
wait
or
should
they
send
me
half
the
quantity
and
refund
the
difference".

I
wanted
the
goods
urgently
so
I
asked
that
some
of
my
oder
be
dispatched
and
I
would
re
order
when
needed.

It
duly
arrived
in
quick
time.

I
would
use
Power
Tools
Direct
again.
Good
website
with
easy
purchase
instructions.

Delivery
is
very
quick.

I
would
recommend
petmeds
to
anybody.
This
is
the
3rd
time
I
have
made
a
purchase
from
Heinnie
Haynes
and
every
time
I
have
received
perfect
service.
This
is
my
first
order
.
So
far
so
good
Habe
schon
viele
Versandapotheken
durchprobiert
,
von
Doc
Morris
über
versandapo
bis
hin
zu
sanicare
war
alles
dabei,
aber
bei
apo-rot
hat
mir
der
Service
einfach
am
besten
gefallen.
Im
Ganzen
gefiel
mir
der
Shop
am
besten,
die
Bestllung
und
das
Bezahlen
läuft
immer
problemlos,
die
Lieferung
ist
mit
durchschnittlich
1-3
Tagen
schnell
genug
für
mich.
Einfach
top!
As
a
religious
gym
goer,
I
take
my
training
very
serious,
along
with
great
nutrition.
I
went
to
the
Town
Fair
in
Wallingford,
CT
to
get
my
original
OEM
tires
replaced
on
my
2011
Titan
on
March
22,
2014.
From
the
manager
Frank
in
the
front
to
the
alignment
guy
and
tire
guy
who
worked
on
my
truck
in
the
back
they
were
all
very
friendly
and
helpful.
The
alignment
guy
came
out
and
showed
me
the
results
and
even
though
the
truck
was
"in
the
green"
the
toe
was
still
slightly
off
and
he
wanted
to
adjust
it
to
get
it
perfect
regardless.
That
made
me
feel
good
knowing
it
would
have
eventually
went
out
from
spec
but
considering
he
had
it
on
the
rack
he
made
the
adjustments
instead
of
just
rolling
it
outside
and
not
caring.
The
tire
changer
was
attentive
and
did
exactly
what
I
asked
of
him
without
breaking
his
smile.
I
didn't
get
the
feeling
he
was
being
disingenuous
but
that
he
was
just
naturally
nice.
There
was
a
small
problem
not
having
the
tires
in
stock
(they're
not
common
I
guess
in
20"
size)
and
I
had
to
wait
about
an
extra
hour
or
so
for
them
to
get
them
from
the
warehouse
(I
couldn't
fault
the
Manager
on
that).
The
only
other
very
minor
negative
was
one
of
my
new
tires
had
rust
all
over
the
outside
of
it
when
I
got
my
truck
back.
Best
guess
is
the
truck
they
were
in
must've
had
a
rusty
metal
rack
or
whatever
and
the
tire
sat
up
against
this
during
transport.
Other
than
these
two
things,
which
I
didn't
feel
should
effect
the
rating
I
gave
them,
I
would
recommend
this
store
when
you
need
tires.
One
more
thought,
they
also
carry
trailer
tires
as
well
as
lawn
mower
tires.
So
I
guess
they
are
a
one
stop
shop
for
anything
tire
related.
My
recommendation
is
make
sure
you
have
them
pre-order
your
tires
if
you
have
a
need
for
these,
or
have
an
unusual
size
like
I
did,
just
to
be
safe.
good
site
great
deals
Had
a
great
experience.
Was
able

I've
already
had
several
friends
get
on
the

too
I
ordered
several
packages
of

and
they
arrived
as
ordered
and
were
delivered
in
a

manner.

I
use
a

at

are

The

on

with
no

Having
been
warned
off
a
refurbished/secondhand
site
in
London
by
bad
reviews,
I
searched
on
Google
and
found
Microdream
with
excellent
reviews,
and
they
have
not
let
me
down.

A
quality
laptop
for
silly
money,
free
carriage
but
still
sent
by
overnight
service
to
arrive
next
day.

Never
again
will
I
consider
anything
new,
I
shall
look
at
Microdream
for
a
replacement
of
my

soon.
Simple
ordering,
then
delivered
at
the
first
opportunity,
all
safe
as

Highly

Guys,
Aubrey
has
a
hell
of
a
thing
going
here.
A
reliable
fitness/supplement
company
that
is
true
to
its
word,
and
ethical.
Something
I
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
nowadays.
I
believe
that
they
will
soon
become
one
of
the
leading
fitness
brands.
Visit
on
nit.com
and
#GETONNIT.
You
won't
regret
it.
Great
site
for
finding
parts
,
delivery
so
fast
was
quicker
than
going
to
local
supplier
and

much
cheaper
.Thanks
a
lot
The
products
pcgamersupply
offer
are
top
notch,
exactly
the
same
things
you
can
find
at
a
store.
Except
you
don't
have
to
leave
the
comfort
of
your
home
as
the
codes
for
the
card
is
emailed
right
to
your
computer
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
I
just
found
this
website
last
week,
wish
I
would
have
found
it
sooner!
B&H
never
fails.
Awesome
prices
Awesome
shipping.
Tons
of
products.
Just
plan
AWESOME!
I
found
this
firm
almost
by
accident,
they
supplied
mu-y
requirement
very
quickly
and
at
a
good
price.
Wilth
one
itrm
there
was
a
problem,
which
was
resolved
speddily
and
to
my
satisfaction.
QUICK
DELIVERY
WITH
A
GREAT
PRICE.
WILL
USE
THEIR
SERVICES
AGAIN
I
found
the
product
excellent
and
the
service,
having
decided
what
to
buy,
could
not
be
faulted.
I
looked
high,
low
and
in-between
for
the
10,000#
Equalizer
Hitch,
and
found
it
at
Dyers
Online
for
the
lowest
price
AND
free
shipping!

That
is
incredible,
considering
the
fact
that
this
hitch
probably
outweighs
an
adult
silver
back
gorilla.

Okay,
maybe
not,
but
the
shipping
costs
alone
is
the
reason
I
ignored
other
sites
and
continued
searching
until
I
hit
on
Dyers.
Found
the
sump
pump
that
I
needed,
with
other
similar
pumps
and
reviews
for
comparison,
at
the
price
that
I
couldn't
pass
up,
delivered
to
my
door
quickly.
Too
bad
you
can't
run
the
government.
They
really
do
beat
any
competitive
price
and
give
you
xtra
5%,
as
long
as
providing
website.will
definetly
will
recommend
to
anyone
and
will
keep
on
buying
from
this
sites.
Feels
great
to
deal
with
site
that
keeps
its
commitment.
Way
to
go
guys!!!!
I
thought
I
was
renting
a
student
edition
and
you
sent
me
a
teachers
edition.
I
cannot
honestly
turn
in
my
work
with
this
book
already
having
all
the
answers.
I
specifically
selected
a
student
edition
when
I
rented
the
book.
Easily
understandable
instructions
for
applying
the
labels.

Have
not
put
it
through
several
washings
yet,
but
so
far
am
very
satisfied
with
the
product.

Coming
from
an
overseas
area,
I
was
expecting
delays
through
customs,
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
on
how
fast
I
received
my
order.
This
is
one
of
the
few
places
in
the
UK
where
I've
been
able
to
find
Vic
Firth
AJ2
drumsticks.
They
were
priced
at
about
what
I'd
expect
and
the
delivery,
although
only
99p
was
very
fast.
sorry,
but
I
have
had
a
very
bad
experience
and
I
probably
will
never
buy
any
parts
from
you
again.
Had
a
great
experience
using
this
site
to
book
my
flight
home.
Very
Easy
to
use.
There
are
two
problems
I
had:
one
being
that
the
shipping
was
incredible
slow,
and
second
is
that
they
start
to
count
the
days
of
use
from
the
moment
you
order
the
book.
iam
so
happy
with
what

I
can't

how
useful
the
guys
a
heinnie
were!
Very
helpful
and
quick
to
reply
to
queries,
knowledgeable
about
the
products,
cant
fault
it!
I've
been
buying
from
Tape
Online
for
many
years.

Their
prices
are
always
better
than
anywhere
else
and
their

is

I
won't
go

I
lost
the

of
my

Barbour
International,
I
am

and
here
it
is
impossible

it

Thanks
to
Country
Attire
I
could
have
obtained
it,
am
very
grateful.
The
service
and
the
delivery
has
been
rapid
and
professional.
Undoubtedly
Country

is
the
best
shop
online
of
the

This
is

I
used

I
was

I

received
the

by

Great
product
and
fast
shipping
The
loan
process
was
so
simple
and
April
was
friendly
and
helpful
in
making
the
process
go
smoothly
and
quickly.
I
will
be
a
repeat
customer.
First
time
order
but
feeling
very
good
I've
ordered
from
QuietPC
quite
a
few
times
and
they've
always
given
accurate
information
and
prompt
service.
Would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
an
affordable
and
reliable
online
outlet.
Damaged
goods
that
were
damaged
in

were

Thank
you.
I
ordered
a
bosal
exhaust
for
my
car
and
when
recieving
it,
it
was
dinged
up
from
the
shipping
and
was
a
little
disappointing.
With
a
little
modifying
I
made
it
work.
I
would
buy
here
again
though
since
the
price
is
pretty
good.
Seems
like
it's
mostly
the
shipping
companies
now
a
days
that
mess
up
the
products.
I
ordered
a
racketball
racket
which
arrived
two
days
later
with
no
problems
at
all.

I
have
bought
from
Tennisnuts
before
and
have
always
had
great
service,
so
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
them.
The
jersey
and
bib
shorts
are
exactly
how
I
wanted
them
to
be
made.

Couldn't
ask
for
a
better
product
or
a
better
price.

Thanks!

Although
not
trained

a

lack
of
trustworthy
repair
shops,
I've
had
to
become

guy

have

I
found
the
short

the

to

outstanding.
I
like
the
free

Well
I
went
to
what
I
thought
was
the
hotel's
site
and
made
a
reservation.

This
was
your
site.
Then
I
called
the
hotel
directly
to
ask
for
some
special
requests.

The
hotel
informed
me
there
were
no
rooms
available
and
they
had
been
100%
booked
for
some
time.

They
also
said
to
not
use
un-trustworthy
sites
that
do
not
have
updated
information
and
to
call
back
and
try
to
get
my
money
back
ASAP!
Delivered
quick
great
prices,
keep
it
up.
Ordering
was
simple
and
fast.
I
called
to
inquire
about
the
discount
for
active

members.
I
was
given
great
customer
service
with
fast
results.
Thanks

From

I
searched
the
internet
for
a
specific
Bordeaux
and
Saratoga
had
it
at
the
best
price.
My
first
experience
with
Flashbay
has
been
great.
I
was
assigned
an
account
manager,
Anthony,
who
was
very
helpful
and
walked
me
through
the
entire
process.
The
drives
and
magnetic
latch
boxes
I
received
are
very
high
quality.
I
was
pleased
to
find
out
that
the
flash
drives
were
shipped
in
the
magnetic
latch
boxes.
I
was
expecting
the
two
to
be
separate.
I
will
definitely
order
from
Flashbay
again.
I
placed
my
order
on
Dec
19
2012,
that
was
a
month
ago.
It
STILL
hasn't
arrived.
I
am
less
than
pleased.
Needing
spares
for
a
faulty
shower
unit
where
the
manufacturer
had
gone
out
of
business
I
expected
to
have
difficulty
locating
the
parts.
Steamshowerparts
were
superb.
One
phone
call
to
check
whether
the
bits
I
wanted
would
fit.
Ordered
them
and
delivery
was
the
following
day.
Hopefully
I
don't
need
to
order
any
more
parts
for
the
shower,
but
if
I
do,
I
will
be
using
them
again.
This
is
the
2nd
time
I
have
used
Blackcircles
and
I
would
recommend
them
to
anyone.
Not
only
were
the
tyres
on
sale
at
a
competetive
price
there
was
absolutely
no
hassle
involved
in
getting
them
fitted.
Well
pleased.

"Special
Deal"
in
the
Raw
Food
Industry.
PartsGeek
made
it
very
easy
to
find
and
order
the
parts
that
I
needed.

This
is
not
an
easy
task
for
me
as
I
have
had
several
strokes
and
find
it
difficult
to
understand
some
things.

The
user
experience
on
the
website
was
easy
for
me
to
navigate.

The
parts
I
ordered
were
delivered
in
a
timely
manner
and
I
really
appreciated
the
ease
of
this
entire
process.
Miles
ahead
of
the
competition
but
would
be
better
if
you
could
customize

by
adding
text
or
maybe
a
link
or
two.
The
high

worked
well
on
my
glasses

Not
an
easy
site
to
set
to
set
up
for
initial
entry.
I
found
what
I
was
looking
for
by
Google
search
and
it
was
the
cheapest
around.
Delivery
was
slightly
quicker
than
expected
too
which
was
good
news.
Will
happily
use
again.
Order
process
was
easy
and
delivery
was
within
4
days.
Haven't
used
the

long
enough

Recommend
highly!
I
was
shocked
to
see
the

Am
thinking
of

this
is
really
unacceptable.

Great

All

about

Picked

I

much
to

OptiContacts.com

I'll

I

for

can
see
where
that

they
are
making
me

That
is
no

to
run

a
customer

The
price
on
the
parts
I
purchased
was
outstanding.
The
price
was
about
1/2
that
of
comparable
pieces.
The
estimated
shipping
time
was
5
to
8
days,
but
the
parts
came
in
just
4
days.
I
will
tell
my
friends
and

I
have
purchased
several
products
from
Onnit.com.

The
Alpha
Brain
is
my
favorite.

It
heightens
my
visual
capabilities,
I
notice
my
hearing
becomes
more
acute,
and
my
sense
of
smell
is
more
vivid.

My
note
selection
while
playing
my
musical
instrument
is
more
fluid
as
well,
and
its
more
natural
to
make
notes
sound
cleaner
and
as
intense
or
as
soft
as
I'd
like
them
to
be
with
more
ease.

My
intonation
also
seems
to
improve
after
I've
taken
Alpha
Brain.

From
my
experience,
Onnit.com
is
reliable.

I
had
an
address
change
and
their
customer
service
department
handled
it
quickly
via
e-mail.

Very
smooth
customer
service.

Great
company!
Drop

was
excellent
and
they
were
very
helpful
when

refused
my
pen

Found
it
in
the

box
on
pick
up.
Great!
Awesome
will
order
again
Great
prices
and
instant
delivery.
Will
definitely
be
shopping
with
them
again!
The
service
provided
by
Appliance
Online
was
fantastic,
and
the
follow
up

was
equally
the
same
with
regular
updates
on
the
delivery.
The
delivery
was
on
the
specified
time
and
we
got

a
call
again
to
say
that
they
would
be
here
within
hour.

team

Mike

Richard
ref

who
took
all
the
measurement
to
ensure
the
appliance
was
able
to
go
through
the
house
etc.
They
showed
professional
courtesy
and
were
so
kind
to
ensure
that
everything
went
well.
The
item
was
an
American
fridge,
they
even
took
the
doors
off
to
ensure
that
it
would
safely
pass
through
the
hallway.
Good
prices,
fast
response
Medisave
is
simply
awesome.Customer
service
was
awesome
and
my
stethoscope
(all

is

beauty!!!
I
would
definitely
recommend
Medisave
to
anyone!
Ordered
with
some
trepidation
as
online
services
are
not
good
sometimes.
I
was
happy
to
see
delivery
so
fast
and
when
one
of
the
cartridges
would
not
work,
it
was
replace
immediately
with
no
hesitation.
Now
I
just
have
to
see
how
long
the
cartridges
last!

So
far,
everything
I
have
ordered
from
PartsGeek
has
been
reliable,
delivered
promptly
and
at
excellent

i
will
continue
without

to
purchase
from

discovering

Online..
DinoPC
is
a
website
I
and
my
brother
have
used
in
the
past
and
just
recently.
They
have
a
great
selection
of
custom
PC's
that
you
can
customise
with
ease.
We
were
pleased
with
the
product
and
the
time
it
took
to
receive
said
product.
It's
awesome.
I
am
usually
fairly
busy,
and
find
any
kind
of
shopping
online
a
chore.
However
using
lenstore
is
so
quick
and
easy
as
they
send
you
reminders,
and
keep
all
of
your
details
to
hand,
all
you
need
is
a
couple
of
clicks
and
your
lenses
are
delivered!
No
fuss,
no
hassle.
I
used
this
product
before
and
had
great
results.

Was
getting
if
from
a
local
chiropractor
but
we
had
a
personality
conflict.

Great
to
know
this
product
is
available
on
the
web.

Great
product
and
was
shipped
promptly.
The
parts
were
shipped
in
a
box
that
was
too
large,
and
it
arrived
with
the
top
broken
in,
as
it
was
sealed
with
only
one
piece
of
tape.

There
was
no
packing
list
to
be
found,
so
I
don't
know
if
one
was
shipped
or
not.

Luckily
the
contents
were
unharmed.
So
i
have
just
completed
my
3rd
order
with
cjs-cdkeys.com
and
their
service
has
been
great.
When
i
got
my
first
salary,
i
decided
to
buy
a
Rolex
watch
for
my
dad
and
a
bracelet
for
my
mom.
So
i
asked
my
brother
about
it
and
he
suggested
Melrose
Jewelers.
There
collection
of
Rolex
watches
is
amazing.
Initially
i
was
not
able
to
decide
which
one
to
pick
but
atlast
was
able
to
choose
one
for
my
Dad.
Service
provided
by
them
is
also
good
and
the
price
is
the
best
you
can
get.
There
was
one
little
hitch
along
the
way,
but
nothing
to
demote
it
from
5
stars.
No
reason
not
to
give
it
a
solid
rating.
I
am
delighted
with
my
blinds
-
they
arrived
a
day
earlier
than
expected,
they
appear
well
made
and
the
online
instructions
for
fitting
were
invaluable.

Thank
you
very
much,
to
order
the
blinds
was
a
last
minute
decision
by
me
and
I
ordered
online
with
a
little
trepidation
as
I
did
not
have
time
to
order
a
sample,
however
I
am
delighted
by
the
outcome,
the
speed
of
supply
and
the
excellent
packaging.
I
brought
in
my
F150
to
get
my
snow
tires
changed
over
for
my
summer.

Mike
and
the
rest
of
his
team
went
out
of
there
way
to
make
sure
the
job
was
done
right
and
in
a
timely
manner.
Great
job
thanks!
They
had
the
lowest
price
for
the
Milwaukee
battery
I
could
find
in
the
UK.
The
website
was
clear
and
had
an
option
to
pay
with
PayPal.
The
item
arrived
next
working
day,
with
free
delivery.
Website
full
of
info,
super

and

My

was

and

Good
experience.
Priceline
continues
to
provide
moderate
travelers
like
me
with
accommodations
that
I
desire.
Good
product,
easy
to
take,
seems
to
be
working,
I
would
and
have
already
recommended
onnit
to
others.
Thank
you
Fast
service
but
wrong
parts
shipped
the
first
time,
did
receive
return
authorization
and
waiting
for
hopefully
right
parts
to
be
shipped
on
the
second
go
around.

It
appears
that
person
pulling
the
first
order
did
not
read
invoice
or
info
written
on
box.
I
experienced
a
number
of
glitches
in
the
system
while
attempting
to
navigate
and
order
parking
for
the
upcoming
holiday.
After
entering
the
needed
information
on
3
separate
times,
I
waited.....
and
waited.....
and
waited
for
the
system
to
move
me
to
the
next
page.
Unfortunately
that
didn't
happen
so
I
had
to
close
out
and
restart
the
process
3
times.
There
is
a
saying
that
if
something
is
too
good
to
be
true,
then
it
probably
best
left
alone.

These
brushes,
on
first
inspection
seems
to
be
an
exception.

They
are
good
for
the
money.

I
have
used
one
of
the
one
inch
brushes
for
applying
glue
in
some
biscuit
joints,
and
it
did
the
job
very
well.

They
could
be
used
in
art
painting,
if
you
wanted
to
cover
a
large
area
with
a
wash
maybe.
Their
ordering
system
is
fine,
but,
on
this
occasion
they
were
out
of
stock
of
the
most
required
item
on
order.


From
the
information
given
it
would
appear
that
it
was
a
picking
problem,
no
stock
on
the
shelf
when
the
picker
came
to
pull
it.

I
was
informed
promptly
of
the
problem
but,
I
still
have
to
wait
two
to
three
weeks
for
it
come.
We
ordered
two
net
curtains
for
our
large
Georgian
windows
and
they
look
very
classy
on.
Delivery
was
fast
and
are
very
satisfied
with
our
purchase.
Thank
you.
Sent
oven
control
unit
out,
within
days
they
called
to
inform
me
it
was
done.
I
paid
and
had
item
back
2
days
later.
(Sent
item
out
on
a
Saturday,
had
it
back
the
very
next
Saturday)
Worked
perfectly.

Saved
me
from
buying
a
whole
new
oven
due
to
this
control
unit
being
discontinued.
They
also
came
in
right
at
their
quoted
price.
Happy
customer.
I
love
my
steam
account
and
having
all
my
games
in
one
place
but
it
kind
of
sucks
when
you
can
go
elsewhere
and
get
games
cheaper
but
are
not
complete
with
steam
keys.
This
site
beats
steams
price
and
gives
you
the
steam
key
immediately.
Absolutely
Brilliant,
I
highly
recommend
to
all
steam
users.
My
only
criticism
is
that
I
was
unable
to
see
what
the
various
room
prices
were
since
I
assume
they
vary
depending
on
memberships,
age,
etc.


I
believe
that
I
did
get
the
best
rate
since
it
was
prepaid.
Made
an
online
reservation
through
a
partner
site.

Received
an
e-mail
saying
the
unit
was
available
at
any
time
from
the
date
of
reservation
until
the
move
in
date.

Drove
to
Storage
facility
12
days
prior
to
reservation.

property
manager
lied
and
said
he
called
me,
"NEVER
did"
and
said
reservation
was
only
for
24hours
and
he
did
not
have
a
unit
for
me.

I
showed
him
the
e-mail
confirmation
and
asked
where
it
said
that.

He
didn't
have
an
answer.

Said
he
might
be
able
to
still
get
me
a
unit
by
my
moving
date.

I
told
him
don't
bother
and
he
wasted
my
time.

Very
Disappointed.

Will
not
be
recommending
them
to
anyone
anytime
soon.

Poor
customer
service.
What's
not
to
love?

Instant
postage
in
any
amount
you
like,
printed
instantly.

Timely
resolution
of
errors
made
by
boneheaded
employees
practicing
the
"oops"
method
of
shipping
(printing
the
wrong
postage),
quick
My
credit
card
is
from
abroad
and
backed
up
by
VISA
(just
like
my
local
debit
card),

but
somehow
their
system
did
not
accept
it.
Yep,
that's
right.

Ordered
my
parts
on
a
Wednesday
night
(around
10pm)
and
recieved
them
Saturday
morning.

There's
a
reason
the
owners
club
I
looked
at
suggested
them
and
fast
service
like
that
is
exactly
why.

Also,
the
price
of
the
parts
I
bought
meant
I
could
get
two
for
the
price
a
main
dealer
was
asking
for.

I
will
most
definitely
be
using
them
again
in
the
future.
Bought
a
Traktor
Kontrol

based
on
the

upon
Merlin
in
the
never-
ending
search
for
bargain
priced
bike
stuff.
I
was
amazed
at
how
cheaply
some
items
were
selling.
I
was
even
a
little
wary
till
I
saw
the
large
number
of
satisfied
reviews
of
the
company.
the
part
i
ordered
was
at
a
great
svings
as
opposed
to
my
local
autozone
we
wereoff
for
2
weeks
so
the
shipping
time
was
of
little
trouble
in
order
to
save
7
dollars.

the
fed
x
side
of
the
deal
is
what
sucked
they
were
not
prompt
with
delivery.
a
new
shipper
shopuld
be
greatly
considered
otherwise
i
was
completely
satisfied
with
my
parts
geek
transaction
once
again.
i
will
purchase
from
parts
geek
again
when
and
if
needed
Fast
services,
excellent
!!!!!
I
got
a
trade-in
estimate
just
before
Christmas
and
ordered
two
custom
configured
27-inch
iMacs.
I
knew
that
it
would
take
Apple
6-8
weeks
to
deliver
the
new
machines.
Gary
kept
me
updated
on
the
order
progress
while
I
was
waiting.
The
new
iMacs
arrived
with
the
wrong
keyboard
which
was
quickly
and
easily
swapped
for
the
correct
one.
Even
though
the
delivery
was
8
weeks
after
the
original
quote,
I
received
the
quoted
amount.
All
around
good
customer
service.
Still
good
store,

nice
bright
color
screen
,
really
nice
checkout
icon,
fast
entering
of
data
into
form.
This
is
the
place
to
purchase
glasses
We
rented
a
car
in
Einburgh
Scotland
and
in
Shannon
Ireland
and
both
times
the
service
was
great
and
fairly
reasonable.

Will
definitely
use
again
if
ever
in
the
area
are
you
kidding
me
with
a
review
..they
sent
my
mirror
cover
s
supposedly
to
the
wrong
address.
Clearly
on
there
site
my
address

was
correct...no
one
gets
back
to
you..first
I
had
ups..With
fake
tracking
numbers
then
fedx
with
wrong
address..company
is
a
joke..There
is
no
customer
service..stay
away...
Great
company,,,,,,,
trusted,,,,,and
will
be
comingback
with
more
business!
I
wouldn,t
hesitate
in
using
this
company
again.
They
were
quick,competitive
with
their
pricing
and
their
communication
was
faultless.
Recomended!
Excellent
communication
throughout
the
buying
process.
We
used
Trademarkia
to
obtain
2
trademarks
for
our
skateboard
manufacturing
company.
Within
9
months
the
name
mark
was
completed
and
we
have
the
certificate
to
prove
it.
The
second
is
stuck
in
the
USPTO
because
of
a
conflicting
mark
submitted
by
another
company
but
that
is
no
fault
of
Trademarkia.
Raj
is
an
awesome
TM
attorney
and
I'd
recommend
anyone
use
them
for
any
trademarking
needs.
Amazing
service.
Fast
shipping,
great
price
I
have
always
had
a
very
pleasant
shipping
experience
with
FRC
Logistics.
We
ship
out
30-40
loads
of
wooden
flooring
to
various
locations
in
the
midwest
and
northeast.
Ive
been
working
with
FRC
Logistics
for
around
8
months
now
and
have
always
been
able
to
count
on
them
to
transport
our
freight
on
time.
I
would
definitely
recommend
them.
I've
used
partyrama
twice
now
-
the
products
are
good
and
at
a
reasonable
price.
The
items
came
quickly
and
safely.
I
was
very
pleased
with
the
efficient
and
speedy
service
DJkit.com
provided.
Would
definitely
use
them
again.
Always
trustworthy.
I've
used
all
the
travel

or
another
and
now
I
booked
my
last
7

at

including
3
cruises.
No
booking

like
one

and
the

is
almost
half
the
price
of
the
other
sites.
i
needed
a
cheap
but
good

for
work
,
i
either
break
them
or
lose
them
but
at

£14-00
a

i
would
just
order
another

,
excellent

Easy
parts
look-up,
affordable

and
fast
and
convenient

You
will
not
do
better
than
going
to
WD
Bathrooms
for
price,
service,
and
delivery.
I
rang
the
company
with
a
few
questions
prior
to
ordering
and
they
were
so
helpful
and
reassuring
I
had
no
doubts
about
the
product
I
ordered.
You
really
should
try
cheap
smells
they
are
so
much
more
reasonable
than
the
high
street
If
you
need
a
poster
then
this
is
the
company
to
deal
with
It
definitely
does
what
it
says
on
the
tin.
Really
fun
showers
for
the
grandchildren.
We
don't
have
to
persuade
them
to
get
clean
anymore.
Thank
you
Menkind
for
the
shower
head
and
the
brilliant
delivery
service.
What
fantastic
service
we
had
from
GAK
from
our
initial
on
line
enquiry,
to
a
very
informative
phone
call
regarding
product
info
and
delivery
options.
An
extremely
easy
to
order
website
and
next
day
delivery
at
no
cost
to
us,
all
this
and
unbeatable
prices
why
would
you
go
anywhere
else,
excellent.
I
also
appreciated
your
very
prompt
and
helpful
communications
when
I
was
planning
the
trip.

I
was
not
familiar
with
Paris
and
CDG
and
was
very
thankful
for
your
help.

We
will
certainly
contact
you
when
we
return.

Merci!
I

GNC
where
this

what
she

just
trying
to

me.
I
Like

she
wouldnt
show

what
I
wanted
and
talked
it
down.

They

quickly
and

perfectly.
Great
place
!!!!!!!
Every
order
I've
placed
with
B&H
Video
has
been
unbelievably
easy.
Order
arrived
next
day
as
requested.
The
carrier
had
some
trouble
finding
my
address
(nobody's
fault)
and
both
they
and
Dolphin
Fitness
phoned
me
to
let
me
know.
The
product
arrived
in
great
condition
and
was
the
cheapest
I
could
find,
I
will
definitely
be
using
them
again!
good,
from
the
start
to
the
end
I
was
sent
the
wrong
year
for
the
part
I
had
order
and
have
not
been
able
to
send
back
due
to
not
being
able
to
speak
to
a
human

hostelworld
has
been
super
helpful
when
i
need
to
find
accommodations
in
a
new
city.

i
am
not
especially
good
at
advanced
planning,
so
I
rely
heavily
on
the
hostworld
reviews
and
they've
been
spot
on
every
time.
I
bought
on
eBay
SquareTrade
extended
warranty
for
my
Nikon
D1x,
I
send
my
camera
with
their
service
provided

to
be
repair
but
this
people
still
my
cap,
eye
viewer
and
original
retail
box,
after
7
day's
they
call
me
and
offer
me
my
"money
back"
......$95.00
the
price
of
the
warranty
because

the
warranty
doesn't
cover
the
sensor
repair...to
day
is
20
days
after
that
and
I'm
still
waiting
for
my
money
back........FRAUD!!!
I
was
very
pleased
with
how
quickly
they
shipped
me
my
part.

The
price
of
the
part
and
shipping
were
very
reasonable
and
I
will
be
doing
more
business
with
them
in
the
future.
Easy
to
use,
fast
delivery,
parcel
fits
through
letterbox
I
love
Opticontacts!
It
makes
what
is
usually
a
pain
in
the
neck,
a
very
easy
process.

I
save
money,
time,and
stress.
Thank
you!
Fast
delivery
and
excellent
service.
A
brilliant
service
and
prompt
delivery
and
kept
you
informed
of
progress
every
step.
Just
what
I
wanted
without
waiting
too
long.
The
service
is
great
and
I
tell
you
as
a
friend
to
buy
at
Inkfarm
cause
I
watch
my
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.
I've
been
hosting
my
company's
site
with
InmotionHosting
for
quite
a
few
years.

In
that
time
I've
had
one
awkward
experience
-
which
the
company
profusely
apologized
for.

Never
been
repeated.

On
the
contrary,
the
service
I
get
from
them
is
exceptional.

When
I
have
a
question,
the
response
is
detailed
and
thorough.

I've
steered
friends
from
hosting
elsewhere
because
I
know
they'll
get
great
support
from
InmotionHosting.
your
monthly
fee
is
really
worth
it
and
the
employees
are
always
there
for
you
to
help,
very
good
customer
service
and
a
decent
facility
but
only
no
security
cameras
though.
It
just
doesn't
get
any
better
than
this!!!!
Very
fast
shipping
of
items.

Excellent
prices.

Than
you!

Spent
ages
trying
to
find
a
place
to
buy
Australian
PSN
cards
&
finally
found
it.
Buying
an
OEM
part
is
tricky
so
it
starts
with
a
detailed
website
that
gives
you
the
confidence
that
the
part
shown
is
what
you
want.

That
accomplished,
does
it
get
you
in
good
shape,

quickly,
and
for
a
good
price.

All
accomplished.

I'll
use
them
again.
The
order
came
today.
Looks
good
but
part
has
not
been
installed
yet.
.
I'm
on
a
tight
budget
and
PartsGeek
helped
me
out.

The
parts
were
easy
to
find,
inexpensive,
and
came
quickly.

My
car
is
running
perfectly
now.

I'm
very
happy.
The
service
offered
by
this
company
was
great,
I
didn't
have
to
re-ask
for
any
assistance.
That
makes
booking
with
them
a
joy.
I
got
what
I
ordered
and
fast
delivery
Saved
a
lot
if
money
on
quality
filters.
It
took
no
time
for
my
mirror
to
get
to
my
house.
I
wish
I
had
been
aware
of
this
site.
It
is
so
great
to
see
this
huge
selection
of
product,
at
great
prices.

Simply
put,
they
cannot
be
beaten!

I
love
all
of
the
information
as
well.

I
stopped
by
to
pick
up
a
few
products
and
was
overwhelmed
by
all
the
information.

I
love
supplementwarehouse.com
Got
a
side
mirror
for
a

Hyundai
Sonata,
perfect

&
was
easy
to

Received
the

3-5
days,
very
quick
service.

Would
recommend
and
use
partsgeek.com
again!
I'm
a
budget-minded
guy
who
researches
my
purchases
and
shops
online
whenever
possible.
About
a
month
ago
I
decided
to
pick
up
an
entry-level
DSLR
camera,
which
is
a
big-ticket
item
for
my
budget.
Amazon
had
good
prices
but
paying
sales
tax
as
a
California
resident
sucks.
And
I
thought
buying
gear
from
multiple
sellers
would
complicate
things
in
terms
of
shipping
and
returns.
So
I
looked
for
an
alternative
keeping
in
mind
the
most
important
consideration--price--
and
B&H
came
out
on
top.
No
sales
tax,
free
shipping
all
in
one
box,
and
a
solid
return
policy
for
unopened
and
damaged
items.
I've
found
their
prices
meet
or
beat
Amazon
and
Best
Buy.
Lastly
but
something
that's
a
huge
bonus
is
the
user
reviews
at
B&H.
Their
crowd
seems
to
be
more
knowledgeable
and
professionally-oriented
than
that
of
Amazon,
at
least
for
camera
equipment.
Would
have
preferred
to
know
item
availability
before.

Had
to
halt
project
to
wait
on
back
ordered
parts.
But
they
syated
in
touch
and
it
turned
out
very
well.

No
issues.
Great
parts,
great
prices,
but
slow
communications
having
only
one
option
to
follow
up
on
orders/problems,
that
being
a
support
ticket
process.
It
was
an
easy
process
to
order
and
the
item
was
delivered
in
good
condition
and
very
quickly.
From
ordering
to
receiving
a
fully
enscribed
pen
set
at
my
door
was
less
than
24
hours
in
the
end
and
the
products
were
of
a
high
quality.

However,
the
speed
was
required
because
when
I
ordered
on
the
Monday
ready
for
the
weekend
I
had
failed
to
notice
the
final
button
to
confirm
the
order.

Really
my
fault
I
suppose,
but
it
would
have
been
good
to
have
the
button
highlighted
and/or
a
reminder
that
you
hadn't
completed
your
order
before
I
left
the
site.

When
I
did
order
on
the
Friday
the
pen
set
was
delivered
on
Saturday
morning
in
time
to
be
given
as
a
gift.

Overall
a
very
good
service.
I
have
only
known
the
staff
and
team
members
in
the
Chicago
office
(155
N.
Wacker
Drive)
a
short
while
however
they
continue
to
amaze
me
with
each
client
interaction.

Lourdes
&
Kaitlin
are
both
capable,
hard
working,
intelligent
&
fun,
staff
and
team
members.

And,
my
work
life
is
better
because
of
them.
From
ordering
to
delivery
an
overall
excellent
service.
Would
recommend
to
anyone
This

Looking

I
enjoyed
the
service
but
as
someone
who
orders
a
lot
of
books
I
can't
say
it
was
much
different
than
any
other
site.
I
would
order
from
them
again
for
sure
if
they
had
the
lowest
boom
price,
but
I
wouldn't
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
from
them
(not
in
the
negative
sense).
I've
had
multiple
orders
through
Parts
Geek,
and
I
highly
recommend
them.
All
orders
are
expedited
quickly
and
have
been
completely
accurate
to
this
point.
It
is
refreshing
to
find
a
company
who
you
can
deal
with
and
not
have
any
problems
with.
This
was
my
first
use
of
'Meet
and
Greet'
airport
Parking.
The
pricing
was
very
competitive
so
I
went
ahead
and
booked.
On
the
day
of
departure
we
telephoned
when
within
20
minutes
of
arrival
and
a
driver
was
there
to
collect
the
car
when
we
arrived
at
the
designated
area.
Into
the
airport
building
and
away
to
departures.
I
was
satisfied
about
receiving
my
book,
but
not
pleased
to
see
a
$2.00
clearance
sticker
on
it
when
I
had
just
paid
$30
with
shipping
and
handling.

I
am
using
this
book
to
help
my
son
with
his
handwriting
because
of
multiple
disabilities
and
have
spent
a
lot
of
money
over
the
years
to
help
him
and
don't
appreciate
having
had
to
spend
more
than
I
should
have.

Simple
website
which
was
easy
to
navigate.
Was
given
free
delivery
via
email
after
delaying
completing
my
order
which
was
nice
but
I
think
free
delivery
should
be
standard
like
other
sites.
Not
having
to
send
prescription
was
convenient.
Delivery
was
next
day
and
on
time.
All
in
all
very
happy.
The
electric
adapter
was
just
what
I
was
hoping
for
and
came
as
promised.
A
few
whisky
orders
now,
always
for
presents
and
quick
and
easy
every
time.
The
site
helped
me
pick
the
right
one
and
and
couldn't
fault
them.

Shame
there's
hardly
any
good
wine
and
spirits
shops
around
now
but
this
is
the
next
best
thing!
Good
but
fees
are
expensive
I
do
hope
a
good
service
too!
I
loved
the
service,
i
will
certainly
continue
buying
stuff
with
them
and
the
delivery
time
excellent,
im
pretty
happy
with
the
service
indeed
!!!
The
Blackcircles.com
web
site
was
easy
to
find,
easy
to
navigate
and
had
all
the
information
to
help
make
an
informed
choice
from
a
wide
range
of
tyres.

Ordering
was
simple,
with
a
clear
display
of
where
and
when
the
tyres
could
be
fitted,
with
various
options
available.

The
fitting
centre
staff
were
polite
and
efficient,
so
all
in
all
a
very
satisfactory
experience
and
I
will
definitely
be
buying
my
tyres
this
way
next
time.
You
just
can't
fault
it.
Never
use
another
place
on
the
internet.
Shipping
is
always
great,
and
I'll
never
use
another
place.
Great
supply
of
supplements,
and
usually
the
best
price
from
a
trusted
place.
Need
I
say
more--
great
prices,
great
web
site,
quick
delivery
I
would
definitely
use

again!

2010
from
Merlin
I
collected
from
store
as
I
was
passing
the
lads
in
the
shop
were
really
helpful
as
always.
I
now
don't

bother
spending
hours
comparing
prices
on
the
net
as
I
know
Merlin
always
come
out
on
top
and
staff
knowledge
of
products
is
second
to
none.
Great
pricing,
quick
shipment.
Needed
a
front
end
alignment
done
ASAP
as
I
was
headed
out
of
town
for
the
holiday
weekend
and
driving
a
couple
of
hundred
miles.
Joe
assured
me
they
could
get
it
done
within
an
hour
+/-
10
min.
They
had
it
done
within
a
half
hour!
Great
service.
Thanks
Joe.
Great
service
great
products
and
they
always
go
out
of
there
way
to
help,
can't
recommend
highly
enough.
Ordered
a
cat
for
an
older
BMW.

The
cat
was
was
shipped
the
next
day.

The
aftermarket
cat
needed
a
little
work
to
get
it
to
fit
correctly
but
was
still
happy
with
the
overall
experience.

Would
use
them
again.
A
drooping
personality
has
been
transmuted
into
a
dynamic,
seductive
and
laidback
one
courtesy
the
dizzying
array
of
designer
fragrances
made
available
from
a
single
window
on
ljshopping.net
First
of
all,
I
think
Partsgeek
should
be
up
front
about
shipping
of
returning
the
core
is
to
be
paid
by
customers.
I
would
suggest,
the
price
of
the
part
should
include
the
core
return
shipping,
so
there
are
no
hidden
cost
for
the
customers.
The
first
time
I
have
used
Cult
Pens.
Excellent
service
right
from
the
start
and
I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
I
placed
an
order
for
an
item
that
was
listed
as
working
with
my
vehicle,
but
read
reviewed
right
after
and
found
reviews
that
stated
it
did
not
fit
right
and
decided
to
cancel
(I
should
have
looked
up
those
reviews
first,
I
do
understand
this).

I
immediately
noticed
and
tried
calling
them,
15
minutes
after
the
order
was
placed.

The
automated
only
customer
service
phone
number
instructs
you
to
enter
a
ticket
online
and
hangs
up
on
you.
I
then
tried
to
enter
a
ticket
and
the
ticketing
system
was
down
for
maintenance...
I
then
called
the
automated
number
again
and
selected
the
option
to
place
an
order
instead,
which
actually
put
me
in
the
queue
to
speak
to
someone
(funny
that
they
have
operators
available
to
buy
but
not
for
anything
else).

I
then
sat
on
hold
for
over
an
hour
with
no
answer.

The
next
morning,
I
was
finally
able
to
enter
a
ticket
asking
for
the
order
to
be
cancelled.

I
received
an
automated
answer
a
day
later
that
no
orders
can
be
cancelled
once
placed
and
that
I
would
just
need
to
return
it.

I
then
replied
letting
them
know
everything
I
did
to
try
and
rectify
the
situation
and
that
I
didn't
feel
I
should
be
charged
any
fees
and
should
receive
a
full
refund
when
i
return
the
item,
and
the
next
reply
back
stated
that
no
order
cancellations
are
clearly
in
their
policy
and
that
all
returns
are
subject
to
restocking
fees.

I
feel
that
is
pretty
ridiculous
given
that
I
did
everything
I
could
to
prevent
the
item
from
being
shipped.

To
add
to
this,
I
returned
the
item
and
they
have
received
it
and
I
still
have
not
received
a
refund,
and
because
of
the
non
working
phone
number
I
will
have
to
continue
going
through
the
ticketing
system
in
the
hopes
of
even
receiving
a
partial
refund.

Definitely
do
not
order
from
them
unless
you
are
absolutely
sure
about
the
item,
or
be
prepared
for
a
very
annoying
hassle
because
orders
cannot
be
cancelled
and
there
is
no
easy
way
to
work
with
customer
service...
I
will
not
order
from
them
again.
Pessoal
muita
atenção!
Price
Met
my
expectations.
Only
place
for
improvement
is
the
cost
of
shipping.
However,
the
cost
of
shipping
a
kettlebell
was
fair.
You
really
can't
expect
to
have
shipping
less
than
$10
for
a
36
lb.
kettlebell.
They
were
easy
to
use
and
the
parts
were
packed
well.
Payed
much
less
than
an
auto
parts
store.
Was
worth
waiting
a
few
days
to
get.
I
will
save
the
link
and
use
these
guys
again.
The
ítem
was
shipped
right
away.
The
ítem
was
as
it
was
described.
The
ítem
fit
perfectly.
Other
sites
didn't
list
this
hotel.

Booked
the
room
at
a
great
rate.

Checked
into
the
hotel
and
they
had
everything
in
the
hotel
computer.

Perfect.
Bought
from
Appliances
online
for
the
first
time
and
was
very
impressed
by
the
competitive
prices
and
the
overall
service,
communication
was
excellent
and
I
was
kept
informed
of
the
progress
of
my
order
and
the
delivery
day
and
time
at
every
stage.
I
am
trying
hard
to
find
something
to
criticize
but
I
just
cant
think
of
anything
bad
to
say
about
them.
I
will
definitely
be
using
Appliances
online
again.
I
really
Like
this
website
and
i
am
trusting
This
company
since
1
year
and
also
reffered
to
other
friends
also
Thanks.
Really
Great
website
to
earn
money.,.
This
is
the
great
Website
that
i
found
on
internet
really
happy
with
the
working
of
the
website....
According
to
my
OBD
readout,
I
needed
a
particular
part.

After
searching
the
local
stores
first,
and
realizing
the
pricing
involved
to
"get
it
now",
I
decided
to
check
online.
Several
sites
were
priced
like
our
local
stores,
several
were
not.

PartsGeek
was
the
right
price
on
the
part
we
needed.
Good
priced
food
and
pet
treats.

Shipping
was
fast.
Really
quick
way
of
booking
hotels
on
line
across
the
world
and
paying
beforehand
in
your
local
currency
which
save
hassle
on
checking
in/out.
In
addition
to
a
wide
choice
in
many
cities
and
towns
and
in
all
price
brackets,
you
earn
money
which
can
be
off
set
against
other
bookings.
Hasn't
failed
me
yet.
Battery
needed
to
check
out
a
possible
camera
fault.
Good
service
and
a
resonable
price
but
did
not
need
in
the
end
but
nice
to
have
a
spare.
After
making
a
claim
there
was
a
long
delay
before
settlement
involving
a
request
for
medical
information
(28
pages),
misreading
the
claim
form
regarding
the
payment
method
and
several
emails
on
our
part
chasing
the
company
for
"state
of
play".No
address
or
telephone
number
was
given
for
the
actioning
company
hence
emails
and
many
frustrating
automated
responses.
Wanted
to
give
something
to
our
guests.

Take
pictures
of
them
fishing,
catching
fish
then
put
them
on
a
small
thumb
drive
for
them
to
take
home.

These
are
perfect.

Low
cost
and
they
have
our
image
on
them.

Adam,

and
the
guys
went
above
and
beyond
to
help
me
complete
my
truck
project
with
a
sweet
set
of
aftermarket
wheels
and
tires.
The
amount
of
cars
and
trucks
that
go
in
and
out
of
that
place
daily
indicates
how
smoothly
they
are
able
to
operate

still

Everyone
I

goes
here

and
you
should
too.
My
shower
stopped
working
on
a
Thursday,

I
found
out
the
brushes
had
gone
in
the
motor.
The
next
morning
I
found
the
part
I
wanted
on
Shower
Doctor
as
it
was
the
first
site
to
come
up
in
the
search
engine.
I
ordered
the
part
and
it
was
here
Saturday
morning.
Web
site
was
easy
to
use
and
I
found
what
I
wanted
straight
away.
Easy
to
order
and
pay
by
PayPal.
Delivery
very
prompt
indeed
and
items
well
packed.
The
magnets
were
as
described.

All
in
all
an
excellent
buying
experience.
Seemed
I
blinked
my
eyes
and
the
part
was
there.
It
was
the
perfect
fit!
A
hassle-free
method
of
ordering

at
a
competitive
price.
Easy

Have
used

a
number
of
times
in
the
past
and
will
continue
to
do
so.
The
only
company
I
would
ever
use
for
bathroom
items.
Quality,
service,
cost.
Absoloutly
brilliant.
Excellent
company
to
deal
with.
This
website
is
amazing.

I've
never
had
any
problems
with
them,
and
the
products
I
get
are
always
great.

You
really
can't
find
a

of
this
in
the
USA.

all

I'll

Package
didn't
arrive
on
original
date
but
it
seems
the
problem
was
with
DHL,
who
managed
to
'lose'
it...
However,
the
musclefood
customer
service
was
perfect
-
they
kept
me
informed,
rearranged
the
delivery
and
even
threw
in
an
extra

Having
these
transcriptions
with
the
fat
turn
around
time
and
at
a
price
that
I
as
a
freelancer
can
afford
is
a
great
advantage.
They
run
about
90%-95%
accurate,
however,
but
correcting
them
against
the

takes
a
fraction
of
the
time
and
energy
of
doing
the
transcription
manually.
And
it
gives
me
greater
familiarity
of
the

just
before
I
am
writing
the

I
was
going

When

their

acted
like
there
was
an
error,
but
did
not
tell
me.
Yours
was
super
quick
and
easy
without

Oh,

your

Having
worked
with
Xicom
for
more
than
8
months
I
am
more
than
satisfied
with
their
services.
The
iPhone
&
android
application
development
teams
are
highly
innovative
and
talented.
They
were
very
patient
as
the
requirements
were
huge
and
new
requirements
would
crop
out
on
a
regular
basis.
The
project
managers
were
always
eager
to
discuss
the
project
and
add
their
suggestions
for
the
project.
I
recommend
them
to
everyone
for
all
the
iphone
application
development
requirements.
One
of
the
best
company
I
have
ever
worked
with
in
the
last
10
years.
I
wanted
some
fancy
lettering
for
the
back
of
my
car,
and
found
DIY
Lettering
to
be
the
easiest
and
most
fully-optioned
site
out
there.

The
lettering
came
out
exactly
like
the
website
in
an
amazingly
short
turnaround
time.

Can't
wait
for
a
warm
day
so
I
can
get
this
stuff
put
on!
The
customer
service
is
absolutely
wonderful
and
the
prices
for
many
of
the
items
that
I
purchased
were
better
then
amazon.

Fully
recommend
and
will
be
using
for
all
future
purchases.
I
ordered
an
untreated
3CT
sapphire
-
the
stone
was
just
as
it
was
described,
and
more
beautiful
in
person.

The
sales
people
were
quick
to
respond
to
my
questions
and
I
received
the
stone
exactly
as
promised.

A
wonderful
experience
I
cannot
speak
too
highly
of
the
service
and
gem
quality.
I
highly
recommend
Multicolour
LTD.
I've
been
dealing
with
Express
Medical
Supply
for
four
years.

If
I
run
low
on
a
medical
supply
-
I
know
I
can
rely
on
them
to
get
it
to
me
promptly
and
at
a
reasonable
price.

I
would
not
go
anywhere
else
for
my
medical
supply
needs.
I

Definately
recommend
them
to
anyone,
and
that
really
is
saying
something.
Don't
waste
your
time
with
so
called
free
websites.
Just
sign
up
with
ancestry.com

I
assure
you
will
never
regret
it.
When
you
subscribe,
spend
a
little
extra
money
and
purchase
Family

This
will
allow
you
to
back

will
also
allow
you

Well
worth
the
cost!
I
was
on
my
way
for
a
5
hour
drive
when
at
the
last
moment
my
step
motor
failed.

The
service
department
immediately
took
action
to
replace
the
motor
and
had
me
on
the
road
in
less
than
hour.
They
didn't
have
to
do
that,
but
they
understood
my
need
and
went
above
and
beyond
to
get
me
back
on
the
road
so
I
wouldn't
have
to
cancel
my
trip.This
is
not
the
first
time
I
have
used
the
service
department,
but
have
received
outstanding
service
every
time
I
needed
them.
Thank
you
Al,
Jeremy
and
the
entire
service
staff!
I've
been
driving
around
with
a
locked
up
regulator/motor
for
months,
and
so
it
was
relieving
to
find
a
place
that
sells
both
together
for
less
than
$200.

I
got
the
part
in
about
a
week,
it
took
only
about
45
minutes
to
replace,
and
it
works
great!
Just
wish
that
there

too
slow
Item
was
as
described,
packed
well,
shipped
fast
the
online
site
was
easy
to
use
and
offered
a
competitive
price.
Quick
dispatch
and
a
good
price.
My
parts
came
in
2
days
after
my
order
was
placed,
that
is
faster
than
my
local
parts
store
can
get
something.
The
parts
were
top
shelf
and
frankly
better
than
expected.
I
strongly
recommend
Partsgeek
to
all
my
friends!!!
Used
for
canine
for
5
to
6
years.

Works
well.
They
get
you
in
and
out
fast!9
Through
my
son's
recommendation,
I
went
on
the
website
to
order
parts
for
my
daughter's
car
and
used
the
ground
shipping
option.

I
did
not
realize
the
the
price
on
the
website
was
different
than
the
total
charge.

I
am
pretty
sure
that
I
specifically
chose
the
ground
shipping
option.

Because
I
was
going
to
be
out
of
town
on
a
business
trip
that
morining,
I
did
pay
attention
to
the
final
price
in
the
checkout
process.

To
my
surprise,
I
received
the
parts
the
very
next
day.

When
I
went
back
to
balance
my
checkbook
I
realized
that
the
total
of
the
parts
was
way
over
what
the
website
advertised
them
for,
to
include
the
ground
shipping
costs.

I
have
been
very
busy
and
have
finally
had
time
to
sit
down
and
respond
to
the
email
sent
to
me
about
this
service.

I
will
go
to
the
website
and
see
if
I
can
find
a
customer
service
number
that
I
can
call
to
see
about
resolving
this
issue.
Booked
an
overnight
trip
to
Myrtle
Beach
prior
to
checking
into
our
timeshare,
found
the
lowest
price
on
bookit.com
and
the
booking
experience
was
pain
free
and
easy,
Will
definitely
use
them
in
the
future.
It
seems
that
every
company
in
America
claims
to
have
great
customer
service
these
days.
Most
companies
seem
to
think
that
if
they
keep
you
on
hold
for
less
than
two
minutes
they
have
done
a
great
job.
Great
price,
free
shipping.
Was
easy
to
create
account
and
finish
process.
Nice.
Much
cheaper
than
Amazon
and
all
those
all
supplement
online
websites.
I
love
using
supplement
warehouse.
They'll
BEAT
any
price
out
there
and
their

excellent
service!
The
Inner
fender
fit
perfectly.
All
the
holes
line
up.
I
like
it
better
than
the
original.
B&H
always
have
fair
pricing
and
usually
free
shipping.
Most
of
my
cameras
and
other
electronics
have
been
purchased
here.
I
have
never
seen
the
store
in
NY
but
if
I
ever
go
to
NY,
this
is
one
of
my
goto
places!
I
recommend
this
store
to
all
my
photo
friends.
All
round
thoroughly
enjoyable.

09/03/12
was
dry,
cloudy
but
cold.

Took
Blue
tour.

Up
on
top
deck.

Saw
great
sights
and
driver
slowed
to
allow
good
photos
and
time
to
absorb
what
we
saw.

One
downside
was
that
bus
we
caught
outside
Harrods
terminated
at
Baker
Street
without
any
warning
at
time
of
boarding.
Towel
warmer/
radiator
we
purchased
has
a
quality
finish,
was
at
a
very
competitive
price,
delivered
efficiently
and
safely.

All
round
great
service!

We'll
buy
from
you
again.



Many
thanks,
CJS
CD
Keys
sell
you
the
amazing
game
titles
you
want
but
for
a
lot
less.
They
send
you
your
purchases
almost
instantly
so
you
can
start
downloading
and
begin
gaming.
They
have
always
responded
to
me
within
a
few
hours
when
I
needed
help
no
matter
how
many
times
I
have
needed
it.
They
are
clearly
customer
focused,
providing
you
with
the
best
deals,
support
and
products.
I
would
easily
recommend
this
company
to
anybody.
They
are
brilliant.
A
very
helpful
lady
Emma
steered
me
through
all
very
friendly.
I
have
used
InkFarm's
generic
inks
and
they
perform
very
well
with
no
apparent
reduction
in
quality
but
a
significant
reduction
in
price.
Shipping
out
could
be
quicker.
Love
it!

Everything
I
need
in
3
days
max.

I've
even
had
stuff
shipped
next
day!

Free
swag
is
also
appreciated.
Was
looking
for
a
jeep
gas
tank.
I
found
many
other
tanks
that
the
sellers
said
would
fit
my
jeep
but
looking
at
them
it
was
easy
to
see
it
was
not
what
they
said.
I
came
across
this
site
and
found
what
I
needed
at
a
reasonable
price.
Key
came
within
10min
and
worked
fine,
would
recommend.
We
understand
that
many
people
from
the
US
and
Europe
use
this
web
site
to
book
thier
get
away.

That
being
said,
when
you
make
your
reservation
online
and
then
an
error
is
sent
back
that
our
reservation
didn't
go
through,
and
it
says
to
call
the
reservation
number.



Calling
the
reservation
number,
we
again
book
everyone
(which
takes
another
45
minutes
for
7
of
us)
the
agent
says
the
flights
changed
and
again
the
reservation
didn't
go
through.

Another
45
minutes
later,
the
same
thing
happens.
Be
very
careful!
--
If
you
rent
a
car
from
a
train
station
or
airport,
there
is
going
to
be
a
heavy
tax
involved,
which
is
not
included
in
the
autoeurope
US
price.

So,
it
may
look
like
you're
getting
a
great
deal,
but
then
you
show
up
to
the
rental
desk
and
you
get
slammed
with
a
big
fee.

It
is
clear
that
they
try
and
hide
this
fact
from
customers
by
putting
it
in
fine
print
on
their
website.

My
suggestion:
rent
a
car
directly
from
a
provider,
such
as
Hertz,
Avis,
etc,
and
don't
go
through
a
middle
man
such
as
Autoeurope.

That
way,
even
if
there
are
extra
taxes,
you
see
it
in
the
price
online,
so
you
know
exactly
what
you're
paying
for.

In
other
words,
there
are
no
surprises.
Collected
car
on
time
and
redelivered
on
time
no
problems
thanks
very
polite
The
price
was
good,
so
I'm
a
happy
camper!
No
hassle.
Great
product.
Delivered
exactly
when
they
said
they
would.
The
prices
are
very
competitive
and
the
shipping
its
always
reasonably
priced
and
very
fast.
Barrington
were
a
great
company
to
order
from
and
their
prices
are
completely
affordable.
The
order
was
dispatched
quickly
and
reached
me
via
standard
post
in
3
days.
I
appreciated
the
key-ring
as
well,
I'm
a
sucker
for
the
little
details.
Recently
bought
a
new
pair
of
hockey
astros.
Turned
out
to
be
too
big
and
so
used
the
collect
plus
return
service.
The
refund
was
applied
to
my
credit
card
within
a
week
of
dropping
off
the
returned
item
at
a
local
newsagent,
and
in
the
meantime
had
managed
to
order
a
replacement
pair
which
were
delivered
the
next
day!
I
bid
through
Priceline
for
my
first
time
and
was
a
bit
nervous
about
what
kind
of
place
would
be
booked.
I
tried
it
anyway.
To
my
amazement,
I
was
able
to
bid
and
get
a
great
2.5
to
3
star
hotel
in
the
Mandarin
area
of
Jacksonville.
What
a
deal!
For
$33
per
night,
yes,
$33
per
night,
I
got
a
great
Queen
non-smoking
room
on
the
first
floor.
The
hotel
is
a
bit
older
but
well
maintained
and
updated
with
a
doting,
friendly
staff.
To
my
surprise
it
also
came
with
a
free
paper
and
great
full
breakfast
buffet
that
wasn't
your
typical
"junk"
breakfast
-
no
this
was
full
buffet
with
fresh
eggs,
bacon,
potatoes,
grits,
waffles,
toast,
fresh
fruits,
yogurt,
cereals,
biscuits
and
gravy,
fresh
juice,
milk,
coffee
-
I
was
very
pleased.
I
highly
recommend
Priceline
as
they
certainly
looked
out
for
me,
and
I
got
a
deal
and
a
hotel
beyond
my
best
expectations
I
looked
at
other
sites
and
found
this
one
to
be
the
easiest
and
best
price!

Can't
do
better
than
that!
I
came
without
an
appointment
and
was
taken
very
quickly.
They
were
excellent.
best
priced
and
delivery
service!.
well
impressed.

I
have
yet
to
hook
up
the
water
bowls,
but
these
look
to
be
good
and
solid
and
I
love
the
fact
they
have
a
drain
in
the
bottom
so
they
are
easy
to
clean
out
and
you
don't
have
to
disconnect
the
water
to
clean
them.

They
arrived
quickly
and
well
packed.

I
would
defiantly
buy
from
PetFlow
again.
thanks
very
much
for
your
efficient
service.

Very

what

that
they

There

the

contacted
me
about,
however
the

from

were
sent
to
me
hours
after
my

had
already
landed.
Had
I
not
been

directly
by
the
airline,
I
would
have
missed
my

I
got
what
I
ordered
and

So

Phoned

Phoned

It

then
received

I
had
placed
a

which
will
then
be

on

Very
angry
that
I
was

follow
up
an

I
live
in
the
USA.
my
wife
is
currently
on
business
in
London
and
I
wanted
to
send
her
flowers
for
her
birthday.
I
searched
the
internet
for
a
company
that
could
arrange
this
for
me.
I
have
used
other
companies
in
the
past
and
was
not
satisfied
with
the
flowers
they
delivered,
so
I
decided
to
try
another
eflorist.co.uk
was
my
choice.
After
researching
and
determining
the
electronic
product
I
want,
I
always
check
with
B&H
Photo-Video
first
as
they
not
only
are
likely
to
have
it
in
stock,
but
their
price
is
likely
to
be
the
lowest.
Add
in
B&H
P-V's
reliable
and
prompt
fulfillment
and
it's
no
wonder
why
they
are
my
preferred
On-Line
vendor.

this
this

NO

I
make
some

my

already
made
one
for
my

Had
to

the

was
wonderful

and
understanding.
KIDDOS
to
the
crew!
I
have
used
PetFlow
to
purchase
the
special
dog
food
recommended
by
our
vet.

The
price
is
right
and
they
ship
promptly.
SerenataFlowers
kept
me
informed
of
each
step
of
the
process
so
I
could
go
about
my
business
without
worrying
where
my
order
was.
Etalaze.net
has
great
products
and
low
prices.

They
process
orders
quickly,
ship
quickly,
and
respond
immediately.

I
ordered
Enantrex
this
time
around,
and
received
it
in
about
3
weeks,
even
quicker
than
I
expected.

The
merchandise
was
still
sealed,
so
I
knew
it
was
legit.

It
was
extremely
potent
also.

I
will
definitely
be
ordering
from
these
guys
again,
because
they
are
the
only
place
I
order
from.

Check
this
site
out,
you
don't
have
to
be
skeptical.

The
reviews
speak
for
themselves,
and
if
anyone
is
posting
a
negative
review
they
are
probably
lying.

Never
once
had
any
problems.

I
am
once
again
a
satisfied
customer.

and
were

My
only
question
is,
Why
did
the
one
side
I
think
it
was
the
left
cost
more
than
the

by
about
$30?

Other
than

I
ordered
a

for
my
'04
Focus.

The
price
was
the
lowest
on
the

ordering
on
the
website
was
straight

and
quick.

The
correct
mirror
arrived
within
a
few
days
and
was
packed
very
well
for
shipping.

I
received
exactly
what
I
ordered
and
was
expecting,
not
only
in
a
timely
manner
but
for
a
great
price
as
well.

I
will
definitely
order
parts
from
PartsGeek
again.

and
that

The

was

when
the

installed
it,
it
was

The
price
was
the

i

will

After
placing
my

I
had
a
call
from
Reidys
to
say
that
the
guitar
I'd
ordered
had
a
scratch
on
it
and
that
it
was
the
last

in

they
offered
me
the

with

if
I
wait
a

for
a

took
about
a
week
for
the
guitar
to
arrive
but
I
was
kept
informed
by
text
messages
and
the
guitar
is
great.
I
called
for
one
location,
and
they
could
give
me
deals
from
multi
locations
and
sources.


Pretty
quick
I
ordered
a
couple
of
parts
on
the
same
invoice!
One
of
the
parts
was
not
available
but
all
your
email
said
was
a
part
was
not
in
inventory.
I
had
no
idea
which
one.
I
needed
those
parts
asap.
I
called
5
times
and
never
got
a
hold
of
anyone
but
it
did
hang
up
on
me
each
time
after
6
minutes
on
hold.
I
then
wrote
to
you
and
got
a
canned
response
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
I
mentioned
in
me
email.
I
wrote
again
and
got
another
canned
response,
still
not
responding
to
what
I
said.
I
will
be
working
with
ebay
from
now
on
as
they
respond
so
they
don't
get
a
bad
review
where
you
don't
care!!!!
I
have
ordered
from
Supplement
Warehouse
for
the
last
couple
years
with
no
problems
at
all.
They
always
have
my
products
in
stock
and
the
5%
price
adjustment
policy
is
awesome.
I
highly
recommend
Supplement
Warehouse
for
anyone
ordering
supplements
and
bodybuilding
products.
I
ordered
Hitman:
Absolution
the
night
before
its
release.
Delivery
next
morning
and
it
was
upgraded
to
Professional
Edition.
All
my
purchases
with
ShopTo
I
have
been
very
happy
with.
My
friend
and
I
just
started
a
film
business
and
needed
to
get
a
few
basic
essentials
ordered
before
we
start
filming
in
the
summer.
B&H
has
an
excellent
reputation
and
we
were
referred
by
a
friend
here.
This
is
our
first
time
ordering
and
were
very
happy
with
how
simple
and
easy
their
checkout
process
is.
We
look
forward
to
working
with
B&H
in
the
future.
Onnit
is
a
good
and
reputable
company.
I
have
been
a
customer
for
a
long
time
and
have
appreciated
their
products.
One
product
in
particular
has
helped
me
most
and
that
is
Alpha
Brain.
Alpha
Brain
has
cured
a
lot
of
my
ADD
and
issues
with
focusing
and
being
alert.
My
job
requires
it
in
the
most
boring
of
circumstances.
Only
issue
is
I
really
enjoyed
the
original
formula
over
the
current
one.
Thanks
Aubrey
and
Joe
for
an
awesome

company!
I
talk
to

I

she
is
always
so
very
helpful
I've
read
mixed
reviews
but
decided
to
try
FramesDirect
for
my
prescription
sunglasses
because
they
had
exactly
what
I
wanted
at
a
significantly
lower
cost
than
other
places.
The
online
order
process
was
smooth,
received
a
phone
call,
yes,
phone
call
from
a
representative
confirming
the
order
and
asking
if
I
had
questions.
Received
my
glasses
a
bit
sooner
than
promised
and
they
were
exactly
what
I
expected.
Would
definitely
order
from
FramesDirect
again.

I

My

and
I

I

This

I
found
the
transmission

I
was
looking
for,
it
was
in

and
was
cheaper
than
the
one
in

Turns
out
they
were
the
exact
same
brand
and
such,
Partsgeek
just
had
it
priced
$15

minus
the
$8

I
saved
7
bucks

on

The
order
arrived
precisely
when
they
said
it
would.
Any

I
will

It
has
been
a
good

I
am
more
than
satisfied
with
my
experience.
This
is
the
store
that
has
everything.

Every
shopping
experience
I
have
had
with
them
has
been
satisfying.
If
they
have
the

I'll
purchase
from
them
before
I
go
to
my

service
from
HH.
I
had
a
special
request
and
this
was
met,
swiftly,
without

and
to

Beyond
that,
pricing
is
v.
competitive
and
the
delivery
service
is
very
fast.
I've
been
a
customer
for
several
years
and
I
can't
rate
HH
high
enough.
Although
the
mobile

of
minutes.

The
UFC
store
had
the
limited
edition
Anderson
Silva
Nike
shirts
instock
during
his
recent
fight,
no
one
had
those
shirts
except
Nike
themselves
but
they
sold
out
fast,
and
they
offered
a
discount
to
members
of
their
club
too.
Shipping
was
a
bit
high
but
if
you
wanted
one
of
these
Silva
shirts
you
had
to
get
them
from
the
UFC.
Pricing
wasn't
bad
either.
I
bought
from
Title
during
their
recent
sale
and
had
an
issue
with
an
item,
it
wasn't
their
fault
but
I
called
them
up
and
they
offered
a
refund
for
the
damaged
item.
I
was
impressed
with
their
customer
service
and
prices.
I've
purchased
from
them
again
and
have
been
happy
with
my
purchase.
I'd
recommend
them.
I
ordered
a
few
supplements
from
Sollyshealthshop.com,
the
prices
and
selection
were
ok,
but
all
items
on
their
store
include
free
shipping
so
that
was
a
big
plus.
There
was
no
min.
order
amount
or
coupon
needed
for
the
free
shipping
either.
Order
arrived
within
a
few
days
too.
I'd
recommend
them.
Their
prices
are
usually
better
than
everyone
else
online,
and
their
shipping
is
very
fast.
I
use
wine-searcher
often
to
shop
for
wine,
Liquorama.net
has
almost
always
been
the
cheapest
out
of
all
the
other
options.
I
buy
from
them
at
least
every
other
month
and
my
shopping
experience
has
always
been
very
good.
They
have
free
shipping,
and
a
huge
selection,
but
their
customer
service
is
very
lacking.
They
have
a
great
selection,
and
their
shipping
promos
are
pretty
good.
Highly
recommended.
I've
purchased
from
finewinehouse.com
a
few
times
in
the
past,
they
usually
ship
the
same
day.
I've
never
had
to
talk
to
customer
service
but
their
site
is
easy
to
use.
They
send
out
free
shipping
newsletters
every
once
in
a
while
also
which
helps
save
some
cash.

That
is
exactly
what
I
received
when

They

it,
no

I
took
the
plunge
and
ordered
a
loose
diamond
from
Brilliance.com.

The
price
was
the
best
I
could
find
anywhere
and
the
customer
support
rep
was
extremely
helpful.

My
only
small
issue
was
that
I
never
received
the
email
alert
that
the
diamond
had
shipped.

Other
than
that
everything
went
perfect
and
the
diamond
was
exactly
as
ordered
along
with
an
appraisal.
I
have

can
honestly
say
I
have
not
found

time

computer

than
that
used
by
Printerpix!
We
used

recently
after

I
found
the
parts
I
needed,
and
they
were
delivered
as

Excellent

I

(Mikki)
who

My

I
had
thought
it
would
be
two

of
the

My
only
regret
was
that
I
wish
I
had
opted
for

A
great,
centralized
place
to
find
a
storage
unit
in
very
little
time.
The
communication
with
the
storage
unit
complex
was
practically
instantaneous,
too.
They
have
my
information
within
moments
and
I
was
able
to
rent
it
in
the
same
day.
I
bought
all
of
my
equipment
for
my
photography
classes
in
college
through
B&H
and
never
had
a
bad
experience
with
them
ever.
If
anything
ever
came
up
they
were
helpful
and
helped
fix
the
problem
immediately.
They
are
fantastic
and
I
continue
to
use
them
now
that
I
am
out
of
college
with
all
my
photography
needs.
We
did
two
tours
in
Paris
through
Viator,
the
Eiffel
Tower
and
The
Catacombs.

Both
guides
were
delightful
-
Niamh
(Gaelic,
pronounced
Neev
in
phonetic
English)
for
the
Eiffel
Tower
and
Caroline
for
the
Catacombs
-
were
excellent,
knowledgeable
and
entertaining
and
warm.

Skipping
the
line
alone
is
worth
it,
but
when
you
get
excellent
guides,it
becomes
what
we
Yanks
call
a
no-brainer.

Gave
a
5-star
review
to
both
on
Trip
Advisor,and
have
made
two
more
bookings
for
our
next
trip
to
Italy.
All
was
well
until
I
realized
that
I
had
made
a
mistake
on
my
return
date.

As
I
prepared
to
print
my
boarding
pass
for
the
return
trip,
I
realized
that
I
had
punched
the
correct
day
on
the
INCORRECT
month.
Travelocity
wanted
to
charge
me
a
total
of
almost
$400
to
correct
it.
I've
mucked
a
few
barns
in
my
day.
(For
you
city
slickers,
mucking
is
the
term
for
shoveling
the
cow
shit
out
of
the
barn.)
Even
after
asking
for
a
supervisor
who
spoke
American
English
(none
were
available),
the
cow
shit
was
piled
from
$50
up
to
around
$400.
That's
pretty
deep
pile
of
shit
isn't
it?
I
resolved
it
by
calling
the
airline
who
realized
that
I
had
made
a
mistake.
I
paid
only
$50.
Forrest
Gump
said,
"Shit

I
just
didn't
like
it
on
me.
After
being
let
down
on
delivery
dates
by
Argos
I
decided
to
try
UK
Sports
based
mainly
on
the
reviews
I
read
about
them
-
wasn't
disappointed.
The
product
(treadmill)
was
great
(also
easy
to
assemble)
and
the
delivery
service
first
class
(speedy
and
cheery
delivery
driver).
The
treadmill
(an
Ironman
brand)
is
much
better
quality
than
my
last
running
machine
although
to
be
fair
it
had
given
up
the
ghost
after
seven
years
of
constant
use!
If
you
want
to
be
treated
fairly
and
taken
seriously,
shop
at
BH.
A
competent
compliment
of
engaging
staff
who
are
clearly
enjoying
their
lives.

I
am
always
happy
to
be
in
the
store
chatting
to
whoever,
discussing
brands,
seams,
cleats
carbs,
watts
and
cadence.

A
real
enthusiasts
environment
with
an
artistic
attention
to
detail.

Any
problems
with
faulty
kit,
you
will
be
refunded
or
replaced
your
item
within
reason
and
warranty.

A
nice
place
to
be,
albeit
at
the
higher
end
of
the
market,
you
can
always
be
wise
and
luck
out
on
a
sale
item
at
the
end
of
season.

Always
a
pleasure
with
great
facilities
and
healthy
culture.

My
only
criticism
is
that
the
Jersey
status
only
lasts
a
year,
then
it
is
reset.

Correct
me
if
I
am
wrong,
but
loyalty
is
accrued
over
a
lifetime,
not
reset
for
fiscal
opportunity.
I
have
used
RoamRight
for
two
overseas
trips
-
one
for
two
months
and
a
second
for
1
week.

Buying
the
insurance
was
straightforward
and
used
straightforward
forms
on
the
website.

No
hesitation
in
buying
again.
Easy
check
out.



All
around
easy
They
ship
pretty
fast
and
the
prices
are
very
reasonable.
The
title
says
it
all.
An
excellent
fast
and
friendly
service
with
good
priced
tyres.
Thanks
for
the
speedy
delivery.

Ordered
on
Tuesday,
delivered
on
Thursday
-
standard
delivery.

Wanted
the
whiskey
for
a
pal
by
that
Sunday
-
so
well
sorted!
Came
across
West
Coast
from
an
online
search
and
decided
to
try
them
for
safety
razor
products
(blades,
soap,
skin
care).
Competitive
pricing
and
efficient.
My
Karcher
high
pressure
washer
suddenly
started
leaking
big
time.

I
opened
up
the
gun
and
found
a
small
washer
on
the
jet
bush
had
broken.

I
ordered
a
replacement
from
Ransom
and
it
arrived
in
a
couple
of
days
and
the
jet
wash
is
now
working
perfectly
again
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
a
new
gun.

Great
job.
A
couple
of
clicks
to
reorder,
lenses
received
in
a
couple
of
days.

Couldn't
be
simpler
.....or
cheaper.

Highly
recommended.
Site
was
a
big
help...
made
finding
a
storage
near
me
a
snap
I'm
new
in
this
place,
and
they
make
me
feel
like
an
old
friend!,
it's
like
they
know
what
you
need.
The
site
popped
up
as
one
of
the
options
through
trip
adviser.
The
hotel
I
wanted
was
slightly
cheaper
on
easytobook
compared
to
the
other
pop
ups
and
the
site
was
clear
and
concise
in
reviewing
the
hotel
details.

Couple
of
fields
to
fill
in
and
all
done
for
hotel
in
Rome!
I
was
very
pleased
with
my
purchase.
The
purchase,
confirmation,
follow
through
and
timely
delivery
was
more
than
I
expected.
Even
though
I
had
parts
installation
instructions,

there's

nothing
like
picking
up
the
phone
and
receiving
personalized
help.
Four
star
service,
indeed.
The
money
got
to
the
destination
the
next
day
of
the
request.
Fees
really
reasonable
and
no
hidden
charges.
Found
the
product
I
needed
for
a
new
construction
Gardner's
bath
at
mainfaucet.com.
The
plumber
had
questions
about
assembly--thought
parts
missing.
One
call
to
mainfaucet.com's
customer
service
resolved
the
issue--no
parts
missing,
complete
documentation
available
in
PDF
for
downloads
(packing
listing
of
parts,
step-by-step
illustrated
instructions,
etc.)
AND
toll-free
number
to
DreamLiner
if
tech
support
needed.

I
believe
even
MY
plumber
should
be
able
to
get
it
installed
with
all
this
help!
(Wish
my
plumber
was
as
user
friendly
as
the
support
staff
at
mainfaucet.com)!
See

I've
used
this
company
for
dvd
labels
multiple
times
and
they
always
deliver
a
great
product
in
a
timely
fashion
at
a
reasonable
price.
You
simply
can't
ask
for
more.
I
will
come
to
this
company
first
for
all
my
label
needs.
Good
fast
booking
process
which
was
easy
to
follow.
I
liked
the
"pay

Fast,

Product

No

smooth

When
I
travel
I
always
go
to
sites
with
information
on
the
city
I
will
be
visiting.

This
is
a
great
site
to
visit
when
planning
a
trip
to
New
Orleans.

Make
reservations
for
a
place
to
stay,
tours
and
dining.
Great
information
on
events
in
the
City.
Even
though
the
collection
had
been
discontinued
by
Swarovski
I
found
the
product
I
wanted
simply
and
received
promptly.
West
Coast
Shaving
always
has
what
I'm
looking
for
with
decent
prices
to
boot.
My
products
ship
usually
within
the
same
day
and
show
up
exactly
as
ordered.
Every
product
I
have
used
is
top
quality,
from
my
wool
fat
shampoo
to
my
Merkur
DE
razor.
I
love
their
huge
selection
of
grooming
products
and
plan
to
continue
using
them
in
the
near
future.
SkyParkSecure
send
me
regular
offers
for
travel
services
and
every
time
I
have
used
them
I
have
been
delighted
with
the
service
and
the
deal
I
have
secured.
I
have
never
had
to
complain
and
can
only
recommend
them.
Site
is
great
and
the
customer
care
is
unrivaled!
I'm
a
returning
customer
it
is
the
speed
at
which
orders
placed
with
WCS
are
taken
care
of..
Fast!!
I
think
that
Cory
did
the
best
he
could
for
me
under
the
circumstances.
I
would
be
glad
to
do
business
with
him
again.
Bought
a
Russian
key
of
Rage
from
them,
and
it's
not
working
because
they
only
sent
me
the
Sewers
DLC
key
and
not
the
actual
GAME
key.
You
cant
beat
the
prices
and
how
they
allow
you
to

compare
prices!
Best
supplement
site
on
the
net!
Flowers
were
on
time,
looked
great
and
I
was
sending
them
from
another
country
and
asked
at

5
questions
and
changed
my

and
it
all
worked
to
perfection!

what
I
was

Puzzle

for

I
found
myself
on
ebookers
by
accident
while
looking
to
book
a
holiday
in
Jersey,
with
local
flight
and
car
hire
collecting
and
return
at
airport.
Once
I
had
got
acclimatised
to
it
I
found
exactly
what
I
wanted
with
full
info
on
hotels
with
many
photo's,
so
I
got
my
booking

exactly
as
I
wanted
at
a
reasonable
cost.
I've
been
buying
from
Ideal
Vitamins
for
a
few
years
and
like
their
approach
and

Excellent
service
and
great
prices.
Every
thing
fit
perfect
except
for
the
parking
light.
I
don't
know
if
I
ordered
the
wrong
one
or
what.
I
need
one
for
a
2003
ford
explorer
that
has
two
yellow
places
on
it
Delivered
on
day
I
had
expected
delivery.
The
addition
of
an
auto-matic
e-mail
update
and
attached
picture
as
proof
of
it
being
packed
was
quite
nice.
And
the
products
I
bought
were
of
very
good
value.
Will
definately
use
again,
as
they
have
good
deals
on
a
lot
of
the
time.
I
placed
an
order
for
parts
for
my
vehicle
with
partsgeek
and
at
the
moment
the
order
was
placed,
all
items
showed
available.

The
next
day
I
received
a
credit
for
two
items
that
were
not
actually
available....
no
biggie.

But
the
two
shipments
that
I
received
for
the
balance
of
the
order
is
where
my
difficulty
started.

The
tracking
number
for
one
of
the
cartons
that
was
supposed
to
contain
(2)
rotors
and
a
wheel
hub
in
fact
only
contained
the
wheel
hub.

The
weight
of
the
package
was
shown
in
the

tracking
information
as
not
possibly
containing
the
rotors.

an
exchange
of
emails
this
week
with
them
has
yet
to
resolve
this
to
my
satisfaction.

I
am
still
so
far
without
the
rotors
that
i
did
pay
for
and
they
seem
to
be
confused
as
to
what
I
am
asking
for........a
refund
of
the
purchase
price
for
those
rotors.

I
was
not
able
to
wait
any
longer
for
the
parts
from
partsgeek.com
and
I
purchased
them
locally.

I've
been
using
Printing.com
(Chelmsford)
for
some
time
now
for
to
print
our
charity
leaflets.
I've
always
found
them
to
be
professional
and
helpful.
Prices
and
quality
of
product
are
excellent.
I
really
can't
recommend
them
enough.
They
have
a
great
selection,
prices
are
very
good,
and
the
delivery
is
really
quick.
Sometimes
I
think
they
hire
a
psychic
so
they
have
my
parcel
ready
to
deliver
before
I
order
it.
And
also
free
shipping
over
£30,
which
is
nice.
Everything
was
great!
I
found
the
part
I
was
looking
for
and
in
a
few
minutes
I
had
it
ordered.
It
came
in
about
3
days
with
a
tracking
number
that
was
actually
updated
so
I
could
follow
where
it
was.
Worth
having
a
look
at
if
you're
after
new
blinds.
Best
deal
I
could
find.
Good
price
and
fast
delivery.
I
had
never
tried
the
service
and
gave
it
a
shot
two
weeks
ago.
I
ended
up
with
an
arrival
5
calendar
days
later
than
indicated
on
the
payment
slip.
Heard
my
club
was
closed
on
one
of
the
delivery
dates
-
not
true.
Next
day
the
club
was
open
and
didn't
retry
the
delivery.
I
know
this
is
UPS.
Again,
I
didn't
pay
UPS
for
the
service.
I
may
try
again
-
was
just
frustrating
as
a
first
attempt.
I
was
disapointed
because
the
map
sensor
should
have
come
with
a
new
rubber
sleeve
that
fits
over
the
little
nipple.
I
had
to
use
the
old
one.

The

swing
case
truck
toolbox
is
a
well
designed
and
intelligent
product
for
someone
who
needs
easily
accessible
storage
in
a
truck
bed
with
a
slide
over
cover.

They
are
easy
to
install
and
the
removable
feature
provides
extra
flexibility
in
bed
use.
They
make
the
most
of
a
usually
wasted
area
of
the
truck
bed
and
provide
a
very
convenient
access
near
the
tailgate
where
tools
are
often
needed.

Excellent
quality.

Thank
you.
First
I'd
like
to
say
that
I
ordered
the
wrong
size
jeans,
so
I
had
to
send
them
back
and
my
refund
went
into
my
checking
account
with
in
2
days
after
they
got
them!

So
I
reordered
the
right
size
and
got
them
in
a
couple
of
days.

Big
and
Tall
is
my
new
online
store!

BTW
I
live
in
NW
Washington
State
and
Amazon.com
is
only
about
90
miles
away
and
I
don't
get
my
stuff
them
as
fast.
Good
prices,
good
product,
good
customer
service,
fast
processing,
and
fast
delivery.

The
product
arrived
two
days
before
the
quoted
time
and
the
quoted
time
was
under
a
week.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised.
I
was
making
a
reservation
for
a
hotel,
and
had
asked
for
a
government
rate.
and
was
told
NO,
they
don't
do
that!
I
had
stayed
at
the
same
hotel
a
week
past,
and
was
given
the
lower
rate,

I
then
told
them
I
will
call
the
hotel
myself
and
make
the
reservations.
and
to
cancel
what
I
had
started
with
them,
and
was
told
I
still
have
to
pay
for
the
full
amount
they
had
told
me
about.
While
on
the
phone!

No
way,
was
I
going
to
pay
it!!
Lenses
ordered
Thursday

,
received

What
more
can
I
say
,
excellent.
The
only
complaint


The
plastic
wrap
needs
to
be
wraped
more
times
around

there
were
spotspots
that
the
tent
bag
were
exposed
to
damage
love
this
site
They
have
a
nice
working
system
to
prevent
hackers
/
sckamers
from
using
the
site
or
your
credit
card.
A
really
excellent
moth-killing
product
which
really
gives
the
impression
that
it
will
do
the
job.
The
order
was
processed
and
despatched
very
quickly
and
at
a
reasonable
price.

Have
bought
several
batches
of
Neodymium
magnets.
They
are
unbelievably
powerful,
so
much
so
they
can
be
hard
to
separate.
I
had
a
tight
time
frame
as
I
needed
them
for
a
Business
Expo
I'm
attending.

You
met
my
deadline
and
the
product
exceeded
my
expectations.

Very
professional
looking
and
I
know
they
will
be
a
big
hit
at
my
booth.

Thank
You!
Let
me
start
this
review
by
saying
i
had
also
bought
a
titan
falls
key
from
them,
despite
it
taking
over
8
hours
from
time
of
purchase
to
verify
my
account
and
get
my
key,
the
key
worked
fine.
so
i
thought
id
give
them
another
try
as
not
all
automated
system
can
work
perfectly
all
the
time
(
i
am
a
network
engineer
)
I
ordered
the
part,
and
ot
it
the
very
next
day.
And
it
fit
nicely.
Your
shipping
dept
needs
a
real
organized
manager.

You
have
great
prices
and
products
but
shipping
and
communication
is
a
2
on
a
scale
of
1-10.

You
need
to
step
it
up
with
todays
technology,
you
are
way
behind.
It
is
very
hard
to
run
my
company
because
I
can't
depend
on
your
shipping
department
for
products.
you
guys
are
willing
to
make
buying
easy
but
returning
items
is
like
pulling
teeth.

I
would
recommend
bookbyte
because
it
is
a
lot
cheaper
than
a

however
they
should
be
more
specific
with
the
version
of
the
book
and
whether
it
is
in
SI
or
English
units.

But
overall
I
have
saved
a
lot
of
money
and
will
probably
use
them
again.

I
Googled
"Holiday
Inn
New
Ulm"
and
called
the
number
to
what
I
thought
was
the
Holiday
Inn
hotel
reservations
directly.

The
individual
answered
the
phone
"Holiday
Inn
Reservation
Counter"
and
told
me
6
rooms
were
available
for
the
night.

I
booked
4
after
being
told
that
there
was
a
"hotel
shuttle
service"
available
to
pick
us
up
at
the
small
general
aviation
airport.


When
I
was
asked
for
my
payment
information,
I
tried
to
provide
my
IHG
member
number
which
has
all
my
information,
and
was
told
I
would
need
to
provide
that
to
the
receptionist
when
I
got
to
the
hotel.

Later
I
found
out
there
was
not
a
shuttle
service
and
there
has
never
been
one
at
this
hotel.

We
had
to
wait
almost
an
hour
for
a
taxi.

Upon
arriving
at
the
Holiday
Inn
I
found
out
I
had
been
tricked
by
EXPEDIA,
who
was
pretending
to
be
Holiday
Inn
and
therefore
was
not
eligible
to
receive
my
IHG
member
points
since
I
had
paid
Expedia
for
the
room
and
not
Holiday
Inn.

Points
aside,
I
was
most
frustrated
by
being
told
there
was
a
hotel
shuttle
service
available
when
there
was
not
(costing
us
an
extra
$40
taxi
round
trip).

Also
found
out
that
had
I
actually
booked
with
Holiday
Inn
like
I
thought
I
did,
the
rooms
would
have
been
less
expensive.
i
couldn't
fault
this
service
cult
pens
give.
Ordered
an
ECU
for
my
1992
Diamante.
The
price
was
$100
less
than
the
next
closest.
I
plugged
it
in
and
the
car
now
runs
great.
Took
much
longer
to
troubleshoot
the
problem
than
to
receive
and
fix
it.
Highly
recommend
these
folks.
Ran
over
metal
strip
on
road
one

another

Within
one
hour
of

at

fair
tire
two
tires
were
replaced
and
was
on
the

Without
the

it
would
have
cost
over
three
hundred
dollars.
The
tires
were
replaced
for

seventy
dollars.
We
found
the
Nemo

3P
tent
in
an
article
that
rated
it
as
the
best
3-season
tent
of
the
year
for

OMC

had
it
for
much
less
than
other
websites
(including
the
website
named
for

really
long
river
in
South

and
included
the

as
well.
We'd
definitely
purchase
from
them
again.

a

often

I
own
three

and
always
use
Mavis
on
Main
St.
in
Bay

for
tire
purchases,
brake
jobs
and
wheel

The
desk
staff
is
very
courteous
and
helpful
and
the
mechanics
are
very
knowledgeable.
Their
prices
are
very
reasonable
with
many
specials
monthly
($59.95
for
a
brake
job!).
There
is
a
Friendly's
restaurant
next
door
to
get
a
quick
bite
to
eat
while
you
wait
for
your
repair
to
be
completed.
Highly
recommended.
Bought
a
rear

mirror
that
matched
perfectly.
Delivery

I

Very

I

The

I
love
this
site!
While
I
would
love
to
shop
at
local
merchants,
their
prices
and
service
leave
much
to
be
desired.
When
I
purchase
my
chlorine
from
Doheny,
I
don't
have
to
make
the
trip
to
the
local
pool
supply
store
(where
the
expertise
is
questionable),
and
I
don'
t
have
to
lift
the
50
pound
container
into
and
out
of
my
car.
Delivery
is
super
fast,
the
price
is
right,
and
the
quality
is
superb.
Package
arrived
promptly,
item
was
as
described.
Although
instruction
book
included
the
unit
was
intuitive

enough
to
set
up
without
over
reference
to
the
book.
If
I
were
to
give
any
advice
i
would
set
your
cameras
first
in
their
locations
and
then
it
is
straight
forward
to
plug
in
and
set
up.Day
to

operation
is
straight
forward
.Seems
a
good
piece
of
kit.
Part
was
good,
shipping
time
was
OK,
packaging
was
inadequate,
if
the
part
was
not
indestructible
it
would
have
ben
a
problem.
I
did
a
lot
of
pricing
around
for
the
grill
and
this
was
the
lowest
found.
The
shipping
was
fast
and
the
grill
was
well
packaged.
Delivery
was
very
fast
and
communication
was
quick
and
very
friendly.
It
would
be
hard
to
improve
upon
dealing
with
this
seller
unless
they
lowered
prices
10%.
All
the
flavours
you
can
think
of
under
one
roof.
I'm
so
happy
with
my
purchase.
It's
a
stunning
looking
dining
set,
for
a
great
price.
Very
well
packaged
and
easy
to
assemble.
Great
communication
throughout
and
they
arranged
a
delivery
date
to
suit
me,
what
more
could
you
ask
for.
I
would
highly
recommend
this
company,
it
was
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
them.
Top
quality
goods
and
service.
Quick
despatch.
Looking
for
a
company
to
buy
your
vaping
goods,
no
need
to
look
any
further.
I
bought
a
stunning
engagement
ring
for
my
partner
which
she
absolutely
loves.
It
would

cost
so
much
more
and
to
be
honest
i
wouldn't
of
found
this
style
ring
on
the
high
street.
The
customers
service
team
were
a
great
help
and
answered
any
questions
i
had.
It
was
delivered
very
quickly
considering
it
had
to
be
made.
The
presentation
box
is
of
high
quality
just
like
the
ring.
I
would
highly
recommend
anyone
to
use
this
site.
Fantastic
quality
style
and
service
at
a
price
you
can't
believe.
Thank
you
to
the

for
everything.
I
bought
the

for
a

Charged

Will

Think
it's
going
to
be
great
product.
I
had
no
complaints.
What
I
would
like,
is
to
have
the
certainty
that
they
dont
delete
certain
reviews
under
certain
requests.
I
tried
for
about
a
week
to
find
a
storage
place
for
my
boat
and
many
places
were
full,
some
places
were
not
full
but
never
contacted
me
about
a
spot,
and
others
were
just
rude
on
the
phone.

After
reserving
a
spot
online
I
received
a
call
within
15
minutes
from
Teresa
(sorry
if
I
misspelled
it)
about
the
spot
for
my
boat,
she
made
sure
I
knew
how
to
get
to
the
storage
location
and
if
I
needed
any
other
assistance.

Once
I
went
over
to
the
storage
area
I
was
greeted
as
soon
as
I
walked
in
and
was
pleased
with
the
demeanor
of
the
staff.

Clean
storage,
and
great
customer
support.

You
can
tell
that
these
folks
love
what
they
do
by
the
way
they
carry
themselves
and
treat
customers.

Some
businesses
in
town
could
learn
from
them.
i
ordered
my
parts
for
2001
4runner

that
400.00
looks
better
in

pockets
than
the

We
had
a

Excellent

This
was
my
first
experience
ordering
such
an
expensive
product
over
the
Internet
(a
pair
of
Mavic
wheels
and
a
subsequent
order
of
a
Chorus
cassette)
and
I
am
happy
to
say
that
it
was
a
completely
satisfactory
and
trouble-free
one!
The
wheels
arrived
safe
and
sound,
in
the
Antipodes,
within
11
days
of
ordering
-
and,
at
a
much
better
price
than
I
could
find
here
(Melbourne)!
Ditto
the
cassette!
I
found
the
cushion
to
be
well
made
and
very
affordable.
It
is
providing
me
with
a
modicum
of
comfort
from
sitting
in
a
wheelchair
during
my
recovery.
Have
ordered
from
parts
geek
4
times,they
are
prompt,fast
and
parts
are
excellent.
Ordered
my
mirror
on
a
Monday
morning.
Per
the
website,
expected
an
email
about
shipping
within
1-2
days.
I
never
heard
anything.
On
Thursday
I
used
their
customer
service
form
to
ask
for
an
update;
the
mirror
arrived
that
night.
I
received
a
"your
product
has
shipped"
email
4
days
later.
So,
except
for
the
delayed
communication,
the
product
was
perfect.
I
will
use
them
again.
I
ordered
my
parts
and
had
what
i
was
expecting
in
less
than
24hrs.

Why
don't
you
get
a
more

than
USPS.
They
are
very
inefficient
and
they
never

their

so
tracking
your

is
just
useless.
It
takes
only
3
business
days
for
me
to
receive
an
order
of
about
the
same
weight
as
my

from
amazon.com
and
the

is
around

I
will
NOT

looking
for

about

have
been
short
of
materials.but
overall
good
service
and
like
I
said
a
quality
product,
wouldn't
hesitate
to
use
this
company
again.
Ordered
sog
woodline
and
light
my
fire
firesteel
kit,very
happy
with
the
overall
quality
but
the
edge
on
the
knife
wasn't
very
sharp
,the
firesteel
and
firesticks
were
very
good,
tried
them
out
as
soon
as
they
were
delivered
and
had
a
fire
going
within
seconds.would
use
heinie
again
for
all
my
bushcraft
needs.
Cheap
prices,
fast
shipping
and
great
service
all
around
~
perfect
combination
that's
kept
me
as
a
customer.
Price
option
is
a
big
PLUS
and
alway
enjoy
the
free
stuff
available
to
pick
from
(added
bonus).
Never
had
a
problem
with
any
of
my
many
orders!
Very
pleased
with
my
delivery.
The
items
I
ordered
wheres
the
best
price
I
could
find
on
the
Internet
and
were
delivered
next
day.
Will
be
placing
a
replenishment
order
soon.
Placed
an
order
on
the
10th,
chased
on
the
21st
only
to
be
told
it
had
not
been
shipped
and
would
be
with
me
in
5
working
days.
Chased
a
second
time
on
31st
where
they
still
couldn't
tell
me
if
it
has
been
dispatched.
Waste
of
time
on
all
accounts.
Pleased
with
the
service,
prompt
and
efficient.
A
couple
pound
more
than
my
regular
supplier,
but
i'm
sure
a
5%
discount
will
bring
it
in
line
:-p
So
good
I
have
told
friend
about
you
product
and
how
good
it
is
So
helpful
andspeedy.

Really
use
this
site
every
class!
The
auto
delivery
feature
is
hands
down
the
best
feature
of
the
site.

You
figure
out
how
much
you
feed
your
dog/cat
a
day
and
figure
out
how
fast
that
makes
to
bag
get
used
up
and
have
the
delivery
window
that
long,
and
if
it
changes
just
go
online
and
bump
it
up.

But
your
dog
should
be
eating
only
so
much
food
a
day,
so
it
is
a
pretty
stable
constant
rate
of
use.
I
found
a
website
that
had
all
3
parts
I
needed
for
my
1995
MB.
The
prices
were
half
the
price
I
would
have
paid
at
a
dealer.
I
will
always
check
with
PartsGeek
the
next
time
I
need
a
part
for
my
car.
This
is
the
best
IDE
I've
used
to
date.
It
allows
me
to
do
what
I
need
to
do
without
hesitation
and
it
simply
works!
The
auto-complete
feature
for
example
is
extremely
responsive
and
doesn't
slow
down
the
IDE
at
all
while
working
-
unlike
a
few
others
that
I've
tried.
You
simply
must
try
this
-
it
has
a
free
21
day
trial.
Fast
service
and
quick
shipping
also
had
the
best
price
I
could
find

From

allows
you
to

the

about

to
the
use
of
a
courier
that
then
tells
you
to
within
an
hour
when
your
item
will
be
delivered
it
was
a
wonderful
service.
There
is
so
much
bad
service
out
there
that
it's
very
reassuring
to
know
that
there
are
people
who
still
place
an
emphasis
on
delivering
a
quality
service.
Congratulations
to
all
concerned.
You
deserve
to
succeed.
I
must
admit
that
we
will
be
returning
the
items
that
we
purchased
but
not
because
of
anything
you
folks
did.
Instead
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
my
wife's
colostomy
port
has
FINALLY
healed
up
and
we
no
longer
require
the
supplies
we
ordered.
Your
support
was
prompt
and
the
shipments
were
correct
in
every
aspect.
You
came
through
for
us
when
our
supplies
were
running
low
and
I
thought
we
had
better
order
a
new
supply
of
colostomy
needs.
Thank
you
so
very
much.
I
will
be
returning
the
purchases
next
week
and
you
may
credit
my
credit
card
accordingly.......Dr.

I
know
that
there
are
no
hidden
conditions
in
a
transaction.
I
can
trust
that
what
I
see
advertised
I
can
rely
on.
I
ordered
parts
over
1
week
ago
and
7
days
later
just
received
a
tracking
number
stating
my
package
was
sent.


2
DAYS
LATER
I'M
STILL
WAITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You
call
the
Customer
Service
number
and
get
a
recording
stating
go
to
the
web
site,
which
after
2
inquires
cuts
you
off
so
there
is
no
way
to
contact
Parts
Geek
and
you
just
sit
and
WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'M
SO
DONE
WITH
PARTS
GEEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I
ordered
magnets
and
ferrofluid
from
first4magnets
and
both
arrived
the
next
day,
at
the
time
I'd
been
told
and
both
products
worked
perfectly.
There
was
a
large
choice
of
products
on
their
website,
and
it
was
relatively
easy
for
me
to
find
what
I
wanted.
I've
been
looking
for
months
for
a
good
deal
on
a
set
of
Shimano
M596
hydraulic
disc
brakes.
I've
been
looking
at
local
shops
and
online.
I
finally
found
the
best
deal
at
Merlin
Cycles.
Even
though
they're
in
the
UK,
ordering
the
brakes
was
still
the
cheapest
from
them
even
INCLUDING
the
price
of
shipping
to
the
US!
The
brakes
weren't
even
at
a
special
sale
price.
Just
a
good
price
to
begin
with
at
Merlin.
You
should
definitely
check
them
out!
I
never
trust
my
important
purchases
to
any
of
these
fly
by
night
websites.
Brilliant
service,
very
fast.
the
part
came
in
very
quickly.
Part
arrived
quickly
in
installed
in
about
10
minutes.
The
color
match
is
the
best
I've
seen.
I
will
buy
from
PartsGeek
again.
We
were
on
a
trip
when
my
daughter
wanted
to
download
an
iTunes
app.

I
google
searched
buying
an
iTunes
code
online
and
I
found
this
site.

In
about
ten
minutes
I
created
an
account,
bought
a
cod,
and
my
daughter
had
her
app!

Couldn't
have
asked
for
an
easier
experience.
No
mention
of

were
very

organized
a
speedy

when

Would
definitely
buy
from
Bedeck
again.

Value
for
money
and
very
prompt
delivery
Ordered
my
part
standard
shipping
at
3:30.
Received
next
day
at
11:30.
I
have
used
many
brands
of
anti-virus
over
the
last
25
years
and
Bitdefender
is
the
best
I
have
ever
used.

Smooth
operation,
easy
configuration.

And
when
I
did
have
issues,
like
when
Bitdefender
was
blocking
a
webpage
I
knew
was
OK,
tech
support
was
right
there
to
help.

The
only
problem
I
have
had
involved
a
case
where
someone
was
trying
assigned
a
port
to
an
infrared
camera
and
Bitdefender
wouldn't
let
it
do
it.

So
this
person
uninstalled
Bitdefender
so
he
could
use
Windows
firewall
but
that
too
no
longer
could
be
configured.

So
there
may
be
some
inflexibility
issues
with
Bitderfender.

Otherwise
I
have
recommended
Bitdefender
to
many
friends
and
clients.

Keep
up
the
good
work.

PetFlow's
site
easy
to
look
through.
I
find
the
products
my
animals
enjoy.
AND
the
orders
are
delivered
fast.
I
used
to
order
from
a
different
website
that
shipped
from
less
than
40
miles
away,
but
when
the
switched
delivery
companies,
the
shipping
went
from
1-2
days
to
3-6
days!
Tiger
Fitness
ships
from
almost
350
miles
away
and
I
got
my
order
in
2-3
days!

Plus,
the
prices
are
highly
competitive,
the
selection
and
description
on
the
site
is
better,
the
service
as
far
as
tracking
and
confirming
orders
is
mo
efficient
and
it
came
in
a
nifty
TigerFitness.com
Box!
what
else
can
i
say...
If
you
know
what
you
want,
then
you
cant
find
a
better
website
in
regards
to
pricing,
selection
and
delivery.

And,
you
can
always
pick
up
free
or
heavily
discounted
items.


Will
continue
to
order
online,or
drive
to
the
Oak
Creek
location
for
all
my
supplement
needs.
I
decided
to
start
getting
fit
again
after
a
long
lay
off
about
18
months
ago
and
needed
help
with
my
recovery
after
training.
I
had
entered
the
Cardiff
Half
Marathon
and
trained
hard
for
it.
I
knew
nothing
about
sports
supplements
at
the
time
and
a
friend
recommended
JBC
Nutrition.
I
nervously
popped
in
to
their
old
store
in
Newport
and
was
greeted
with
a
smile
and
made
to
feel
like
an
old
friend.
Got
some
great
advice
and
went
away
with
plenty
to
think
about,
there
was
no
pressure
to
buy,
just
good
advice.
Next
time
I
was
in
the
area
I
popped
into
their
new
place,
again
I
was
greeted
as
if
I'd
known
them
for
years,
Gareth
remembered
me
from
my
last
visit
and
after
another
little
chat
I
went
away
with
a
4kg
tub
of
strawberry
Ultimate
whey,
oh
my
word,
that
stuff
tastes
great.
Went
through
a
tub
in
no
time
and
went
back
and
bought
5
tubs,
each
one
a
different
flavour.
My
only
regret
is
they
are
lasting
so
long
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
pop
in
for
a
chat
anymore.
All
in
all,
you're
always
made
to
feel
welcome,
never
any
sales
pressure,
always
good
advice
and
always
good
value.
Cheers
guys.
Been
looking
for
Bacardi
Razz
for
AGES,
and
they
stocked
it
:-)
Arrived
in
no
time
at
all,
perfect,
thank
you.
Website
is
easy
to
navigate,
everything
is
nice
and
clear.
Bought
the
VO2
Max
tablets,
only
took
two
before
my
last
workout
and
I
had
the
best
workout
ever.
Don't
know
if
it
was
just
a
coincidence,
placebo
effect,
one
of
those
days,
but
I
seemed
to
be
able
to
carry
on
when
I
would
normally
have
failed
and
dropped
the
weights.
Huge
choice,
good
prices.
Would
have
given
5
stars
but
my
student
discount
never
seems
to
work
:-(
So
much
choice,
student
discount
helps
too
:-)
Delivery
seems
to
have
improved
too,
arrived
a
little
quicker.
A
huge
selection
of
sunglasses,
seemed
to
be
the
cheapest
on
the
internet,
delivery
was
very
quick,
can't
ask
for
more.
Having
purchased
two
white
wooden
venetian
blinds
from
woodyatt
curtains
for
the
front
of
my
house,
i
must
say
i
really
am
very
pleased
with
both
the
quality
and
also
the
apperance
of
them,
a
couple
of
my
neighbours
have
also
commented
on
them,

they
were
very
easy
to
fit
and
also
have
a
matching
pelmet
board
supplied
with
them
that
hides
the
top
metal
part,
the
pelmet
board
just
clips
into
place
with
the
supplied
clips,



the
blinds
were
well
packaged
with
no
missing
parts.

i
need
to
buy
an
additional
two
blinds
for
the
rear
of
my
house
in
a
few
weeks
time!!

i
will
most
certainly
be
going
back
to
woodyatt
curtains
again,

10
out
of
10
for
both
quality
and
and
looks.
Total
satisfaction.

I
have
placed
two
orders
with
the
Geek.

Quick
response
and
delivery.

The
parts
were
the
right
parts,
total
quality
and
the
best
price
in
town.
I
rented
a
villa
in
Tuscany.

I
had
specific
requirements
for
ten
people
and
specific
locations
that
I
wanted
to
be
there.

RentVillas.com
provided
me
with
multiple
listings
and
recommendations
based
on
my
requirements.

The
information
packet
that
i
received
gave
all
the
details
and
covered
any
circumstance
that
may
have
come
up.

The
description
of
the
property,
location,
etc
was
perfect.

You
don't
realize
it
until
you
are
actually
on
the
property
and
in
the
surrounding
area.

Typcially
we
have
stayed
in
hotels
in
the
past,
but
I
definately
would
review
the
inventory
and
consider
a
small
rental
for
a
small
group
or
family
or
a
large
rental
for
a
large
group.

I
will
use
RentVillas.Com
without
hesitation.

They
made
this
trip
very
easy
for
us
and
it
was
a
very
memorable
trip.

Typcially
we
travel
in
easy
to
buy
from
no
issues
with
delivery
I
buy
a
hybrid
disk
,
the

if
you

can
not
find
one
item
is
a
excelent
choice
,
have
always
found
the

very

love
the

and
all
items
look
and
feel
great
for
my
training
of
the
London
Marathon
in
April.

Thank
you
again.

I
did
ask
if
they
would
be
kind
enough
to
sponsor
me
as
well
and
although
someone
came
back
very
quickly
they
said
they
couldn't
like
most
companies
in
the
UK
:-(
I
have
absolutely
no
issue
with
the
lens
I
received,
the
packaging
they
were
in
was
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
arrive
safely...adding
a
sticker
for
the
purchaser
to
add
to
their
calender
is
a
nice
touch.
The
car
was
located
in
the
far
end
of
a
civilian
parking
lot.
The
staff
did
not
explain
adequately
where
the
car
was.
It
took
three
trips
to
locate
the
car.
Easy
to
use

Fast
delivery
time.
I
did
not
receive
any
paperwork
with
the
product,
I
do
like
to
read
instructions!
I
shall
use
the
site
again
ordering
was
simple,
price
was
competitive,
and
delivery
was

I
scored
the

it's

Have
used

for
about
3
years
and
have
always
been
pleased
with
the
service
etc.
I
have
been
buying
protein
powders,
preworkouts
and
other
stuff
from
SupplementWarehouse.com
for
a
while
now.
I
signed
up
for
their
e-mail
newsletter,
which
has
all
these
great
deals.
I
save
a
lot
of
money
and
get
free
stuff
as
well.
I
never
have
to
wait
long
for
the
delivery.
I
can
either
pick
it
up
at
work
(I
work
at
UPS)
or
the
other
guys
deliver
it
to
my
home,
which
saves
me
driving
elsewhere.
Thanks
SW.com
for
all
that
you
do
to
provide

with
the

I
need.

Blind,
was
advised
of
despatch,
the
item
arrived
in
perfect
order
and
I
was
able
to
fitthe
blind
without
any
problems.
Very
happy
with
the
service.
This
was
the
first
time
that
I
used
this
service
having
been
dissatisfied
with
another
well
known
florist.
So
I
was
delighted
when
the
flowers
were
delivered
when
expected
and
the
recipient
was
delighted
with
the
flowers.
Ordered
two
items,
they
came
from
different
suppliers
but
both
arrived
within
4
working
days.

Quality
was
good
-
so
I
am
a
happy
shopper.
If
you
have
ever
used
Screwfix
Direct
then
you
will
know
how
fast
and
efficient
they
are,
well
Heinnie
Haynes
are
up
there
as
well.
Ordered
late
but
parts
still
arrived
next
day
with
plenty
of
updates
on
the
status
of
my
order
all
the
way
till
it
arrived
at
my
door.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
all
of
the
fantastic
prices!
I
found
what
I
needed
right
away.
There
was
such
a
huge
selection!
I
shop
both
on
line
and
in
the
34th
st.
store
and
have
never
had
a
problem.
Both
site
and
store
are
very
professionally
run.
I
think
people
are
naturally
reticent
about
using
the
internet
for
purchases
and
they
should
be,
however
my
experience
with
appliances
on-line
can
only
be
complimentary.
While
restoring
my
Technics
SL1210s
I
have
found
Bop
DJ
to
be
my
first
port
of
call
for
genuine
spares.
Everything
I
ordered
has
arrived
on
time
and
exactly
as
described.
I
shall
definitely
use
them
again.
Prices
are
also
very
reasonable.
I
bought
a
wheel
set,
grips
and
a
stem.The
wheels
are
exceptional
for
the
price
and
I
would
say
unbeatable
value
at
£65.
The
spoil
box
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment.

Grab
bags
are
supposed
to
have
about
double
the
retail
value.

I
checked
and
I
could
have
bought
what
was
in
the
box
off
of
your
site
for
the
same
$25
or
so.
And
i
wouldn't
have
picked
a
toy
that
was
too
big
for
my
pugs.
Quick
response
to
my
request.
Very
helpful
in
the
process
of
getting
a
unit.
these
folks
sell
quality
at
a
good
price.
they
don't
hold
you
up
on
getting
your
order
to
you
either.
highly
recommend
.
My
first
key-buying
experience
online
and
it
went
great.
I
provided
false
info
on
my
account
because
I
didn't
think
it
would
matter
so
they
requested
some
ID
which
I
provided
with
a
note
explaining
what
I
did
and
why.
I
asked
if
I
could
still
verify
myself
and
after
a
few
emails
explaining
things,
everything
went
smoothly
and
I
got
my
key
right
away.
Tried
it
and
worked
like
a
charm.
I
rented
Fiat
for
9
pax,
from
01/26
to

Not
only
do
you
get
cheaper
games
in
here
than
if
you
got
them
from
the
main
developer
in
digital
format,
you
get
the
key
so
no
waiting
for
a
physical
copy,
you
will
get
your
key
in
time.
You
can
also
get
nearly
all
the
best
selling
titles
in
here
so
yeah.
I
would
totally
recommend

WITH
THIS
COMPANY
Had
to
wait
for
2
hours
for
the
car.
Tried
to
talk
us
into
taking
out
accident
excess
insurance
at
€28
per
day.
The
air
con
didn't
work
and
the
GPS
they
gave
us
the
wrong
cable
so
went
flat
after
1/2
hour
from
the
airport.
Went
to
a
branch
office
who
were
no
help.
Had
to
alter
our
trip
because
we
got
lost,
wasted
hours
trying
to
find
hotel
and
get
back
to
the
airport
from
Sorrento.
I
would
never
use
them
again,
everybody
waiting
to
get
a
car
was
very
upset
at
the
long
wait
with
slow
service
by
a
few
staff,
no
seating
near
the
counter
to
view
your
ticket
number
made
it
even
worse.
THE
product
arrived
quickley
and
was
in
perfect
condition
with
all
paperwork
etc.Communication
via
e
mails
about
delivery
was
good
.
Have
used
many
providers,
but
Hunt
are
the
most
reliable
&
pricing
is
very
competative.
Delivery
times
are
better
than
other
providers,
and
the
free
sweets
we
got
last
week
went
down
well!!
very
happy
with
the
product
and
service.
Very
satisfied
with
the
service
I
have
received
Fast
friendly
service.
I
know
you
guys
are
legit
and
have
great
prices
for
games.
I
went
to
your
store
from
the
ad
you
had
up
on
pcmag.
But
I
feel
like
a
lot
of
people
are
a
little
turned
off
by
the
lack
of
polish
from
your
site.
Especially
the
verification
part,
where
you
send
the
code
to
the
phone.
Just
saying
that
some
aesthetic
improvement
may
make
people
feel
more
comfortable
when
thinking
about
buying
a
game
from
your
store.
But
besides
that
no
one
can
beat
your
prices
and
that's
all
that
really
matters
to
me
and
probably
most
buyers.
So
THANKS!
Good
support
but
strange

Lost

a

The

I
was
in
need
of
a

for
my

I
called
American
RV
and
they
had
it
in
stock
and
I
was
able
to
pick
it
up
via

call
the

There
prices
are
good
and
they
carry
a
large
inventory
of

I
highly
recommend
them!
I
was
very
please
with
the
purchasing
process
and
receive
my

in
a

I
would
gladly
purchase

I
ordered

rear
brakes
and
rotors
for
my

everything
came
in
quickly
it
all
fit
my

right.
my
only
complaint
is
one
of
my
rotors
had
a
small
nick
on
the
outside
did
not
affect
performance
however,
could
have
been
from

I've
been
using

for
over
a
year
now!
My
only
concern
is
the
cost
of
shipping.
Save
money,
what
more
do
you
have
to
say??
I
have
ordered
8
pairs
of
glasses
thru
Frames
Direct.
Prices
are
fair
although
other
sites
offer
cheaper
prices.
They
honor
their
product.
Only
complaint
is
delivery
is
extremely
slow
and
the
tracking
link
provided
does
not
provide
any
tracking
info
until
frames
are
already
delivered.
Also,
when
my
eye
doctor
used
a
machine
to
check
my
prescription,
the
report
stated
my
lenses
were
progressive
not
single
vision
making
me
question
the
actual
quality
of
the
lenses.
Overall,
great
website,
good
product,
good
customer
service
and
extremely
slow
make-to-delivery
time.
I
found

was

&
without

I
ordered

it
was
promptly
shipped

It
arrived
in
great
condition
&
as
advertised.

The
transaction
went
the
way
all
internet
transactions
should
go
....
unfortunately,
that's
not
always
the
case.

If
you
have
ever
experienced
an
internet
transaction
that
was
a
nightmare
then
you
learn
to
truly
appreciate
the
businesses
that
do
it
right.

I
will
happily
tell
anyone
that
asks
that
WestCoastShaving.com
does
it
right!

Thanks.
I
purchased
2
Michelin
Tyres
from
Tyretraders..
I
went
to
the
Tyre
fitting
Company
14
miles
away
in
Stamford..
Difficult
to
find
the
place,
It
was
a
Tiny
Unit
unmarked
in
a
small
industrial
estate!..
I
eventually
found
the
place
Hi-Q
and
introduced
myself..
I
was
acknowleged
with
a
grunt!..
Which
wheels
mate?..
I
was
asked..
The
rear
ones
please
I
said..
any
chance
you
could
swap
the
front
wheels
to
the
rear
and
put
the
new
ones
on
the
front
please
I
said..
Sorry
mate
we
are
only
paid
to
put
the
new
tyres
on..

OK
I
said
Next
time
I
will
go
to
Black
Circles
they
are
a
little
more
expensive
but
they
have
fitters
local
to
me
and
nothing
is
too
much
trouble!..

Price
The
facility
is
right
next
to
a
bread
factory,
which
is
never
a
bad
thing.
Rental
price
was
right
and
the
location
was
pretty
convenient.
Ho
acquistato
un
paio
di
sneaker
dagli
USA.
La
spedizione
è
stata
praticamente
immediata
ma
ci
hanno
messo
più
tempo
ad
arrivare
da
Bari
a
casa
mia
(100
KM)
che
dagli
stati
Uniti
a
Bari!!!
Ho
scelto
la
spedizione
con
DHL
per
avere
la
sicurezza
che
non
ci
sarebbero
stati
intoppi
ma
così
non
è
stato.
Comunque
la
sede
di
Bari
ha
risolto
il
problema
in
poco
tempo
quindi
il
sito
è
OK,
la
spedizione
di
DHL
un
pò
meno.
I've
booked
with
this
site
and
it
was
quick
and
simple.
I
WAS
GIVEN
NO
HEADS
UP
AS
TO
COST
TO
RETURN
CORE.
ALSO,
NO
RETURN
ADDRESS
LABEL
OR
INFO
UNLESS
I
WENT
ON
LINE...AGAIN.
I

in

5
days
like
they
say
!
Thanx
for
doing
bizness
!
I
ordered
one
of
those
spiffy
economy
fleeces
for
HH
-
the
Patriot
-
looked
great
value
compared
with
my
TAD
Ranger,
and
I'm
a
tightwad.

Looking
up
the
size
tables,
I
carefully
matched
my
measurements
to
those
in
the
table,
sent
off
my
order,
and
waited.
I
purchased
a
Bosch
induction
hob
for
my
wife
as
a
part
of
a
new
kitchen
fitting,
it
was
to
be
a
surprise
for
her,
no
birthday
or
anniversary,
just
a
surprise
present.
It
transpired
that
you
need
special
magnetic
pots
and
pans
to
use
on
the
induction
hob.
as
a
consequence
I
went
online
to
find
the
earliest
delivery
available
for
such
utensils;
the
hob
being
hidden
in
our
garage
until
the
pots
were
delivered.
On
Friday
21st
September
I
found
a
site
for
Hispek
Electronics,
which
boasted
five
working
days
delivery
on
items
bought;
the
price
was
virtually
identical
to
that
of
other
suppliers,
but
the
selling
factor
was
the
5
day
promise.
I
therefore
completed
the
order
form
and
made
payment,
but
at
this
time
was
informed
that
the
delivery
time
was
now
extended
to
5
to
7
working
days.
Having
navigated
the
requisite
pages
I
decided
to
make
the
payment
anyway,
many
companies
I
deal
with,
have
a
safety
time
factor
built
in,
but
deliver
way
ahead
of
forecast.
On
the
following
day
(Saturday
22nd)
I
received
acknowledgement
of
my
order.
On
Friday
28th
September
I
received
an
advice
that
my
package
had
been
despatched
that
day.
The
package
duly
arrived
on
Tuesday
2nd
October;
the
franking
on
the
package
showed
the
pans
had
actually
been
sent
on
Monday
1st
October.
Without
claiming
to
be
a
mathematical
genius,
I
estimated
that

even
assuming
that
Saturdays
were
not
counted
for
packing
and
dispatch
purposes,
the
Friday/Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs/Fri/
and
then
Mon
of
the
following
week,
must
surely
amount
to
seven
working
days.
Thus
my
wait
exceeded
even
their
maximum
scenario.
The
surprise
present
for
my
wife
was
to
my
mind
unnecessarily
delayed,
actually
arriving
finally
on
a
day
when
I
had
to
make
a
trip
abroad,
which
compounded
the
aggravation.
I
could
probably
have
gone
to
any
of
at
least
five
or
six
other
companies
who
without
professing
to
offer
an
express
service,
might
well
have
got
the
goods
to
me
in
a
much
quicker
timespan
more
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
transportation
seems
only
to
have
taken
a
single
day
!
got
exactly
what
i
ordered
fast
Very
happy
with
service,
good
value
for
money
and
good
service
delivery.
Staff
were
well
behaved,
called
ahead
as
hey
said
they
would
and
have
seemingly
donene
a
great
job
too.
He
packed
away
my
spare
and
tied
it
all
down
neatly,
professional;
comes
to
mind
with
attention
to
detail.
Keep
up
the
good
work,
service
is
king!!!
Everything
with
the
grill
was
wonderful.
It
attached
very
easy.
All
the
holes
lined
up
and
it
was
a
snap
installing.
However
I
was
missing
some
hardware
and
I
had
to
make
a
trip
to
the
local
hardware
and
purchase
the
missing
screws
and
nuts
I
needed
to
complete
the
installation.
That
did
not
make
me
to
happy,
but
that
was
a
better
alternative
than
going
back
and
forth
with
PartsGeek.
Great
company
to
deal
with,
bought
a
treadmill
for
a
very
reasonable
price
and
delivery
was
fast.
The
treadmill
is
more
than
enough,
I
use
it
for
8k
per
night
and
it
works
a
treat.
Superdry
offers
great
products
and
good
service,
will
definatly
use
again.
Knowing
that
I
may
be
receiving
a
small
legacy
I
had
set
my
heart
on
a
Fender
Stratacaster,
something
that
I
had
owned
in
!961.
The
group
in
which
I
played
broke
up
in
1962
so
I
sold
it
when
I
got

married
in
1963
and
have

dreaming
of
owning
another
one
for
fifty
years.

Last
November
I
joined

two
other
old
rockers
and
now
play
at
pensioners
lunches,
and
that
was
when
I
seriously
started
looking
at
secondhand
Fenders,
not
knowing
the
amount
of
legacy
expected.
WOW,
now
I
own
a
Stratacaster

Select
in
dark
cherry
and
what
a
stunner
it
is!

Looking
forward
to
our
monthly
lunch
this
coming
Wednesday
16th
February
to
really
try
it
out.
It
certainly
sounds
clearer
and
sharper
than
my
old
secondhand
Sqiuer
that

I
have
occasionally

played
at
home
with
no
serious
intent.
Price
and
service
excellent
Everything
arrived
as
promised,
and
on
time
as
expected.
Part
was
cheap,
exactly
as
described,
and
fit
perfectly.
No
complaints.
I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
Good
pricing.

Excellent
customer
service.
Process
for
ordering
was
clean,
clear
and
quick.

Ordered
part
arrived
within
3
business
days
with
normal
shipping.

Right
Part,
first
time.
I
would
definitely
use
PartsGeek
again
in
the
future.
First
time
user.

The
process
was
so
easy
.
I've
used
BookByte
a
few
times
now
and
have
no
complaints.

The
prices
are
great,
the
shipping
prices
are
fair,
the
site
is
easy
to

It

During

Association's
annual
conference
(February
19
-
22nd)
we
used
for
the
third
consecutive
year
flash
drives
that
contained
our
entire
conference
program.
This
year
we
used
a
pen/flash
drive
combo
with
our
initials
on
the
pen
...
what
an
out
of
this
world
response!
Every
single
person
receiving
one
of
these
was
thrilled
and
most
of
all
they
are
truly
the
gift
that
keeps
on
giving
once
our

becomes
a

there

luckily
the

was
still
in

I
orders

with

everything

Rare
qualities
these

in

Great

excellent
thankyou
Finally
getting
the
best
deal
and
rate
was
painful
as
I
was
given
conflicting
information
by
DriveAway
Holidays.
Each
person
I
spoke
with
was
helpful
and
polite
but
as
I
spoke
to
different
Team
Members
I
was
given
conflicting
info.
and
sensed
I
was
being
given
a
bit
of
a
'runaround'.
They
have
a
complete
line
of
all
the
items
I
need.
Bought
a
few
inks
after
finding
the
site
on
Google.
Excellent

and

Trustable
and
fast

excellent
product!
Quick
and
excellent
work
for
our

cards.
Highly
recommended.
The
only
problem
I
had
was
it
was
supposed
to
be
anonymous
and
it
wasn't
even
though
it
said
it
would
be
if
I
left
out
my
name.
Product
was
just
as
described
and
shipping
was
fast.
Will
def
order
again
in
the

Can't
recommend
John

highly
enough,
great
selection
online,
prompt
delivery
and
excellent
customer
service.

Anyone
buying
from
them
will
not
be
disappointed.
I'll
spend
a
lot
of
time
searching
for
the
best
deal
on
the
internet
for
any
products
I
can
buy
online.

No
matter
how
hard
I
try,
I
have
never
found
any
other
site
with
prices
lower
than
SupplementWarehouse.com
for
the
products
I
purchase.

I've
been
working
out
for
more
than
20
years
and
have
developed
a
loyalty
to
them
because
I
know
they
cant
be
beat.

I
can
only
recall
once
a
few
years
ago
when
I
found
a
lower
price.

Informed
them
and
just
as
promised,
they
lowered
their
price
to
beat
it.
Although
i
have
not
installed
the
part
yet,
that
i
ordererd
i
paid
for
it
online
and
it
arrived
in
perfect
condition
in
a
very
timely
manner.I
would
certainly
recomend
this
company
to
my
best
freind.
Awesome!!!!
I
had
a
good
experience
with
them
for
recent
deliveries
in
UK
&
Australia.
The
communication
was
prompt,
products
as
advertised
and
delivery
was
timely.
Great
service
and
customer
service
Always
on

always
competitive
in
price
can't
ask
for
more
can
you??
I'm
impressed
with
how
fast
I
received
the

Fast
and
efficient.

of

My

website
I
ordered
the
New

bundle
and
using
the
discount
code
from

got
a
bargain
for
only
£49.99
instead
of

As
I've
not

started
using
the
products
I
cannot
comment
on
them
yet
but
it
certainly
looks
good

however
I
was
a
little
disappointed
that
the
goods
took
8
days
to
arrive
especially
as
other
users
had
commented
on
getting
theirs
delivered
the
next

My
Rep.
with
Bulbs.com
(Dave)
is
great
at
helping
me
find
out
what

best
for

needs.
All
I
do
is
call
him
up
tell
the
type
of
bulb
I
need
or
the
scenario
I
currently
trying
to
light
and
he
can
direct
me
where
to
find
what
I
need
and
even
if
his
company
doesn't
carry
what
I
need
(which
is
VERY
Seldom)
he
knows
where
to
find
it.
I

got

key
IMMEDIATELY
through
their
AutoKey
system,
which
is
definitely
a

system.
If

then
I
found
pcgamesupply.
I
will
be
honest,
the
added
fees
for
purchases
could
be
slightly
lower
but
overall,
it's
pretty
great.
I
can
get
any

And
since
it's

delivery
was
quick
as
indicated.
I
will
continue
to
do
business
with
partsgeek....all
good.
The
staffs
are
very
helpful,
and
they
are
willing
to
work
with
you
if
a
cause
occurred
that
allow
you
not
to
move
in
accordingly.
They
are
good,
and
nice
people.
I
liked
that
there
was
no
shipping
fee
and
the
stuff
was
priced
right.
This
is
a
good
source
of
aftermarket
parts
if
you
don't
mind
some
downshifting
in
terms
of
quality.
I
purchased
the
grill
and
it
arrived
fast
with
free
shipping.
It
was
slightly
damaged
though
with
the
tracks
of
repair
efforts.
Nothing
critical,
but
for
other
parts
you
might
want
to
check
thoroughly
when
you
receive
the
parts.
I
ordered
my
screen
wasn't
expecting
it
for
at
least
5
days.
It
was
at
my
house
in
2.
The
packaging
was
well
done
and
the
screen
worked
as
expected.
Ordered
Pentel
brush
pen
and
spare
cartridges.
Really
good
site,
reasonably
priced
items,
and
good
quick
delivery.
Couldn't
be
happier.
Also:
love
the
name
of
the
site.
Caught
my
eye
straight
away,
pen
nerd
that
I
am.
The
web
page
said
that
a
bulb
that
I
purchased
would
fit
my
2006
Prius.

The
proper
bulb
does
NOT
have
three
prongs!

Instead,
the
bullb
base
is
the
same
as
an
incandescent
bulb
of
a
household
table
lamp.

This
is
either
the
dumbest
error
an
alledgedly
competant
and
honest
parts
supplier
can
make,
or
is
a
blatantly
fraudulent
attempt
to
cheat
people
out
of
money.

Those
people
are
the
ones
who
don't
want
to
endure
the
hassle
of
attempting
to
get
reimbursed
from
an
online
supplier.

I
believe
it
to
be
the
latter.
Just
a
good
experience
!!!
The
pricing
for
this
case
was
amazing
and
the
quality
is
equally
as
nice.
The
shipment
was
processed
quickly
and
I
received
that
item
quickly.
Only
one
suggestion.
I
wish
there
were
a
cutout
in
the
case
so
that
I
could
charge
the
Xoom
with
the
case
closed.
Other
then
that
the
case
is
great.
I
purchased
a
power
window
motor
but
the
bolt
pattern
does
not
line
up
with
existing
mounting
holes.

I

Just
the

since
they
have
a
large

of

for

I

other

Parts

the

and

I

what
I

Fault
reported
to
Orange
staff.
While
waiting
for
the
call
to
be
answered
from
my
Orange

mobile
phone,
I
am
told
that
'Orange
prides
itself
on
it's
excellent
customer
care'.
What
a
joke!
I
am
asked
to
dismantle
my
phone
sockets
and
do
tests
otherwise
I
may
be
liable
for
a
£105
fee.
I
am
then
told
by
the
same
non
uk
operative
that
my
fault
would
be
treated
as
a
priority
but
she
couldn't
report
it
because
their
systems
were
down
for
maintenance.
(This
was
on
a
Saturday
afternoon).
She
stated
that
once
systems
were
back
up
she
would
log
the
defect
and
call
me
back
on
my
mobile.
It
goes
without
saying
I
never
got
a
call
back
or
even
a
text.
It
took
a
second
call
to
get
the
fault
recorded
on
the
next
day.
The
earliest
day
would
be
in
3
days
time,
having
been
asked
a
preferred

I
selected

(I
wonder
why!)
My
wife
took
time
off
work
at
a
cost
to
her.
It
goes
without
saying
the
engineer
never
came.
I
rang
to
find
out
why
no
one
attended
and
was
told
I
would
have
to
re
book
the
visit.
No
reason
given!
(Could
it
have
been
because
it
had
never
been
booked
in
the
first
place)
Imagine
how
I
felt!
I
chose
not
to
speak
with
them
and
to
arrange
my
telephone
and
broadband
service
from
another
provider.
I
have
raised
formal
complaints
with
Orange
about
the
actions
of
it;s
staff
during
this
whole
matter,
by
e
mail
on
the
address
they
gave
me.
They
have
responded
saying
the
matter
will
be
dealt
with
within
24
hrs.
Guess
what,
they
haven't
responded
after
5
days!

I
will
take
this
to
the
regulator.
This
company's
service
is
the
lowest
of
the
low.
I
have
been
a
loyal
Orange
customer
via
mobile
for
many,
many
years
but
this
'service'
has
ensured
I
WILL
leave
them,
even
if
it
costs
me
money
and
NEVER
return
for
ANY
service
they
may
choose
to
provide.
This
review
is
totally
honest
in
every
word.
No
one
should
ever
be
expected
to
have
to
suffer
this.
DO
NOT
USE
THEM.
I
understood
the
terms
and
conditions
and
return
policy
of
the
company,
however,
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
discussed
the
item,
(of
which
they
only
had
1).

I
was
also
considering
buying
a
lens
filter/protector.
Because
it
was
a
Saturday,
there
was
no
live
chat
or
person
answering
the
telephone
when
I
rang.
The
store
was
shown
as
being
open.
The
telephone
switched
to
answerphone
and
as
prompted
I
left
a
message
with
my
contact
number
for
someone
to
call
back.
I
sincerely
thought
someone
would
do
that,
even
if
it
was
by
the
end
of
that
day.
I
appreciate
store
staff
could
be
busy.
Sadly,
a
week
later
there
has
not
been
any
contact.
I
did
make
the
purchase
of
the
lens,
but
decided
to
buy
a
filter
from
another
seller.
In
short,
if
you
have
an
answerphone
and
request
details
so
you
can
call
the
customer
back,
then
do
it!
The
item
was
packaged
well
and
arrived
promptly.
Customer
experience
let
down
by
a
lack
of
customer
service.
I
cannot
fault
the
service
from
Speed
Graphic,
very
quick
delivery
of
a
genuine
item
which
had
been
priced
very
competitively.
What
more
can
I
say?
Can’t
fault
the
service
from
the
company,
but
I
could
have
got
the
product
much
cheaper,
sadly
I
found
out
too
late
to
cancel
the
order.
The
item
arrived
very
well
packaged
but
not
by
enough
to
cover
what
I
could
have
saved.
Upgraded
the
RAM
in
my
Macbook.
Very
easy
to
do
and
at
a
very
good
price.
What
a
pleasure
to
deal
with.
The
prices
cannot
be
beat,
the
speed
of
delivery
could
not
have
been
any
quicker.
A
fragile
item
very
well
packaged.
What
more
can
I
say?
I
wanted
a
specific
style,
make
and
pattern
of
mug.
Muglamania
ticked
every
box
and
at
a
price
cheaper
than
anywhere
else
on
the
internet.
My
concern
was
will
I
receive
a
box
of
broken
china,
even
'Royal'
Mail
could
not
cause
any
damage
to
the
items.
Very
well
packaged.
One
very
happy
customer.
I
will
use
them
again.
I
have
recommended
Printerinks

to
many
of
my
friends
and
relatives.
Very
fast,
efficient
service.
Easy
to
use,
great
deals,
B&H
has
it
all
and
they
have
the
best
prices.
Need
I
say
more.
Fast
dependable
service
is
the
name
of
the
game
and
they
have
it
covered.
Excellent
experience
with
eEuroparts
and
highly
recommend
them.

Used
them

They
have
a
large
selection
of
tires
I
always
purchase
my
tires
from
Town
Fair
Tires
the
Hamden
Ct
location.
I
always
buy
Michelins
for
my
vehicles
they
came
stock
on
my
2009
Ford
Escape
never
had
any
problems
they
lasted
me
beyond
the
65,000
tread
life
to
my
amazement
the
Michelin
Factory
stopped
manufacturing
them
for
30
days
or
more
nobody
had
the
Michelin
Latitude
Tour
couldn't
even
order
them
from
a
warehouse.
I
needed
tires
asap

Damon
stepped
in
asked
me
if
I
was
open
to
looking
at
another
brand
and
recommended
the
Toyo
Open
Country
HT
which
he
told
me
he
used
on
his
family
vehicles
SUV's
and
Car's.
They
had
my
size
in
stock
still
disappointed

I
told
him
I
needed
to
do
some
research
on
the
tire
left
went
home
did
some
research
on
the
Toyo
Tire
reviews
were
good
and
found
the
best
price
on
the
internet.
I
also
found
out
that
Michelin
had
a
huge
recall
last
year
a
defect
with
the
side
walls
on
SUV
and
Light
Truck
tires
maybe
this
is
the
reason
they
stopped
manufacturing
them.
I
went
back
told
Damon
I
would
try
out
the
Toyo
tires
he
told
me
in
30
days
if
I
was
unhappy
with
them
he
would
give
me
a
refund
he
matched
the
lowest
price
I
found.They
had
me

the

Though
I
have
only

a
few
products
over
the
past
year,
everything
has
arrived
quickly,
in
perfect

and
worked
as
effectively
as
they
claim.

Keep

Arrived
within

Easy
install
(in
use
now
while
I'm
writing
this),
using
videos
supplied
by
their
customers,

The
one
I
used
was
exact.

Very
happy.

No...very,
very
happy.

Although
I
hope
not
to
need
their
services
again
(my
bad
on
the
original
screen
damage),
replacing
the
screen
using
their
parts
and
instruction
videos,
saved
me
an
easy
$900
considering
the
price
of
a
new
laptop.

Bottom
line?

Good
(no,
very
good)
product.

Fit
perfectly.

Their
install
videos
(supplied
by
other
customers),
are
right
on.
Excellent
price
for
the
product
-
everything
comes
pre-installed
and
in

They
even
named
my

was
a
nice
touch!

I
wasn't
able
to
find
air
filters
to
fit
my
system
locally
and
cutting
the

is
not
the
most
appealing
job.

Now
I
go
to
the
airfiltersdelivered.com
website
and
order
exactly
what
I
need.

It's

I

But

The

both
better

Many
people
look

and

for
the
standard
of

they
are
unparalleled

I
have
been
shopping
for
theater
chairs
for
the
past
three
months,
I
ran
across
the
Seatcraft
12006
chair
from
4seating.

I
first
could
not
believe
the
price
and
was
a
little
worried
about
the
possibility
of
these
not
being
made
well
or
comfortable.

I
decided
to
order
5
chairs
and
when
they
arrived
I
could
not
believe
the
quality
and
comfort,
the
leather
is
soft
and
the
chair
is
better
than
I
expected.

I
would
highly
recommend
to
others.

I
was
a
little
uncertain
before
trying
Ship
Sticks.
Bottom
line,
do
not
hesitate...this
service
was
easy
to
use
and
saved
me
40%
over
UPS.
I
used
UPS
to
ship
clubs
in
a
box
from
Cape
Cod
to
Monterey,
California...surprise
costs
(ie
insurance)
brought
the
1-way
cost
to
$110.
I
signed
up
with
Ship
Sticks
online
in
CA
and
scheduled
my
shipment...cost
$60
including
insurance.
Actually
was
handled
by
UPS.
Flawless
and
actually
easier
than
dealing
with
UPS.
I
chose
to
drop
off
the
clubs
when
I
was
ready
(after
my
last
round)
and
they
were
delivered
to
my
home.
No
question
I'm
now
a
fan
and
will
use
them
again.
One
note,
you
can
also
ship
boxes
or
luggage
if
you'd
like...most
cost
effective
is
if
it
weighs
50lbs
or
more.
25lbs
is
cheaper
to
send
yourself.
The
prices
are
truly
the
cheapest
on
the
web.
I
have
searched
for
better
prices
and
you
just
cant

it.

I
received
the
front
grills
for
my
bmw
on
time
and
they
fit
perfectly
and
look
just
like
the
original.
My
first
time
ordering
from
them
and
I
am
so
happy
with
my
purchase
and
their
good
prices
that
now
I
will
always
order
from
them
as
long
as
I
get
the
same
results.
I
ordered
a
book
online
that
I
had
previously
tried
to
order
through
four
(4)
other
online
stores.
The
other
4
stores
all
showed
the
book
available,
so
I
ordered
it.
Without
fail,
after
each
of
the
4
orders
were
placed,
I
received
an
email
saying
the
book
was
no
longer
available
and
they
have
cancelled
my
order
and
refunded
my
money.

Very
frustrating.
When
I
ordered
the
book
from
Bookbyte,
I
received
a
notice
that
the
book
was
not
available...again,
but
that
they
were
pursuing
other
avenues
to
find
the
book
and
get
it
to
me
instead
of
just
cancelling
my
order.

Two
days
later
I
got
an
email
saying
my
book
was
shipped.
I
received
the
book
a
few
days
later.
After
a
month
of
trying
to
buy
this
book,
Bookbyte
was
the
only
store
that
made
it
happen.
Thank
You!
my
first
experience
went
very
good
and
it
was
very
satisfying.this
time
i
was
told
my
order
was
being
prepared
for
delivery,but
she
never
received
and
i
never
got
any
explanation.i
emailed
customer
service
and
was
told
they
would
look
into
it.her
birthday
passed
and
no
word.a
few
days
later
they
emailed
me
i
would
receive
a
refund.so
disappointing
i
wanted
her
to
enjoy
rather
than
a
refund.not
happy
Arrived
a
few
days
after
order
even
though
I
live
in

about
as
far

as
it
gets.
No

I
was
able
to
view
the
product
via
YouTube
videos
which
showed
step
by
step
unpacking
and
assembly.
This
was
very
reassuring
and
gave
me
confidence
that
I
was
buying
the
right
thing.
I
could
see
the
parts
list
clearly
along
with
the
pictures
of
the
parts.
Orderering
was
easy
and
website
was
also
easy
to
navigate.

Parts
came
in
a
very
reasonable
time.

I
will
definitely
use
them
again.
Hi,
I
don't
know
why
everyone
doesn't
use
them.

Can't
beat
the
price,
and
its
delivered
right
to
your
door.
Item
we
bought
had
a
very
important
part
missing.
So
as
of
now
we
still
do
not
have
the
part
but
were
are
waiting?
Goods
were
despatched
quickly
and
arrived
within
48
hours
of
ordering
on
line.
And
at
a
very
competitive
price.
Couldn't
ask
for
more.
Our
order
was
completed
with
no
problems;
any
advise
given
was
expert
and
knowledgeable.
The
PC
was
delivered
on
time
and
on
the
day
specified
and
was
'double-boxed'
so
there
was
no
damage.
We
will
definitely
use
Dino
PC
again
and
will
recommend
to
family
and
friends.
I
purchased
two
shirts
for
my
hubby
for
our
vacation
to
Cabo
and
while
they
definitely
scream
tourist,
he
was
excited
to
have
the
nice
light
weight
button
up.

We
went
with
the
Batik
print
shirts.

Perfect
for
summer
and
for
vacations.
This
was
a
direct
fit
muffler
with
gasket.

It
is
an
excellent
quality
muffler
and
was
delivered
in
just
a
couple
of
days
from
ordering.

I
would
use
this
vendor
again
Very
happy
with
the
location
and
price.
Ordered
filters,
they
came
in
the
wrong
size.
Immediately
created
a
return
order
and
sent
replacement
ones.
Quick
and
painless.
Great
customer
service.
I
was
impressed
with
the
customer
service.
Pay

you
go

Great
product!
Easy
to
design
and
use.
Today
i
made
another
buy
from
Cjs
Keys,
my
7th
purchase,
so
i
was
curious
to
make
the
math
on
how
much
i've
spent
and
saved
so
far.
Have
used
GAK
many
times
in
the
past
and
will
again
in
the
future.
Super
fast
delivery
once
again
and
better
than
retail
price.
Could
not
recommend
highly
enough!
The
website
is
easy
to
follow,
the
parts
were
delivered
in
a
timely
manner
and
the
price
was
better
than
most.
Amazon
is
quick,
efficient
and
has
reasonable
pricing.
Ordering
was
easy,
can't
rate
this
product
because
I
haven't
received
it
I've
purchased
numerous
goods
from
Heinnie
Haynes
over
the
years.
I
will
continue
to
buy
from
them.
Brilliant
service
and
goods.
Overly
happy
with
my
recent
purchase.
It
was
everything
I
wanted
and
expected.
Can
highly
recommend
the
service
and
professionalism
of
the
company.
I
would
order
again.
Easy
ordering
process
and
fast
shipment.
The
rental
for
both
cars
worked
out
well.
The
cars
were
very
nice
and
new
and
we
had
a
free
upgrade
for
the
New
Zealand
rental.
Only
2
suggestions.
The
pick-up
in
Auckland
airport
was
confusing
because
the
agent
did
not
recognize
our
name
on
the
list
and
almost
had
us
shuttling
into
town.
On
the
drop
off
there
was
no
agent
to
greet
us
or
check
us
in.
We
hoped
it
was
because
it
was
early
in
the
morning
so
we
went
to
the
desk
which
was
on
our
way
to
flight
check
in.
Luckily
we
had
plenty
of
time
and
were
not
delayed
by
this
confusion.
Check
in
was
done
at
the
counter
but
the
car
condition
was
not
checked
with
us.
I
liked
that
the
company
communicates
by
email
often
and
does
a
follow-up.
We
rented
in
wuerzberg
drove
the
autoban
and
romantic
road
to
fussen
over
two
days
then
onto
Munich
.

Impressed
with
car
's
tight
handling
pick
up
and
comfort.

The
were
mo
USB
plugs
to
charge
iPad
.

Tried
to
use
cigarette
lighter
and
adapter
to
charge
iPhone.

Lighter
did
not
work.
Found
vw
dealer
who
changed
the
defective
fuse
and
all
worked
well
rest
of
trip.
I
could
not
find
this
part
at
any
RV
store.
I
found
it
online
and
ordered
the
outside
power
outlet
and
it
was
delivered
promptly.
It
was
easy
to
install
and
I'm
very
satisfied
with
Dyers
and
their
product.
Alaways
use
US
Rentacar
for
the
most
competitive
rates.

Its
a
shame
that
at
the
other
end
Budget
cars
in
the
USA
dont
seem
to
be
able
to
handle
at
any
time,
a
hire
period
of
over
4
weeks
without
the
most
legthy
wait
(even
when
we
have
registered
for
Fast
Track).
Use
price
line
if
you
dont
want
to
get
scewed
by
hotels.com
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
part
and
the
service
that
I
received.

Shipment
was
delayed
on
the
end
of
Fed
Ex
but
I
was
notified.
I
got
paid
in
full
in
a
week
This
whole
ordeal
started
on
4/9/14.
I
received
that
order
on
4/25/14.

Opened
up
the
case
pulled
out
the
glasses
and
the
left
lens
fell
right
out,
I
sent
these
back
that
day
and
Craig
called
me
4/29
apologizing
for
this
terrible
quality
control.
How
could
someone
send
out
a
pair
of
glasses
when
the
lens
didn't
even
fit
right.so
Craig
informed
me
I
would
get
expedited
treatment
and
a
lens
upgrade.

7-10
days
and
here
we
are
5/20
with
no
new
glasses.
I
was
sent
out
an
e-mail
yesterday
to
review
a
product
that
from
what
I
just
found
out
is
still
in
the
lab.

I
called
on
5-16
and
was
told
my
order
was
shipped
and
would
receive
yesterday
5/19
what
a
bunch
of
lies
and
poor
customer
service.
Looks
like
I'm
done
with
this
service
Wowcher
always
has
the
widest
range
of
deals
at
the
best
prices.
Easy
to
use
and
very
reliable.
As
a
lover
of
short-break
holidays
I
find
they
have
lots
of
hotels
in
a
wide
variety
of
locations.
Large
variety
of
costume
options
and
good
delivery
time
but
a
cheaper
delivery
option
should
be
available.
The
price
was
very
reasonable
and
the
service
excellent
from
the
website
through
to
delivery.
Great
site,
great
service.
The
plaque
was
even
better
made
then
it
looked
in
the
pictures.The
3D
effect
was
out
standing.I"m
very
pleased
with
it.I"m
sure
any
one
would
treasure
it
as
much
as
I
do.Thanks

Chuck
Andrews
a
very
fast
transaction
good
communication
The
part
was
shipped
rapidly
and
fit
perfectly.

Great
service?
Luke
turned
up
on
time,
having
called
earlier.

Did
a
good
job,
offered
advice,
quickly
and
efficiently.

20
mins
to
replace/balance
two
tyres.

Would
recommend
to
others.

Price
was
very
competitive.
Ordered
two
pairs
tennis
shoes,
which
were
delivered

24hours
My

nice
selection
for
me.

Order

day
usually

Good
company,
good
selection
but
the
shipping
is
way
too
high
can't
beat
the
selection
or
the
price


handsdown!!!
did
exactly
what
I
wanted
-
clear
and
easy
to
follow
links
and
instructions
Knowledgeable,
helpful,
good
pricing...
some
things
are
excellent
1)
the
web-site
2)
the
range
of
stock
3)
delivery
speed
Used
these
guys
so
many
times
now,
always
worth
a
price
check
and
a
speculative
browse
on
the
web
site...
well
i
ordered
guild
wars
2
instant
and
well
i
got
my
key
only
to
find
its
already
in
use.
i
have
sent
in
a
ticket
and
am
waiting
to
see
what
happens
next.
they
sorted
it
out
within
a
few
mins
and
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
with
how
quick
they
helped
im
very
happy
now
:P
thanks
I
was
looking
for
weeks
and
found
my
parts
on
this
site
in
stock,
couldn't
say
that
about
some
of
the
larger
outfits
out
there.
I
received
confirmation
of
shipment
almost
immediately
and
got
the
package
in
2
days
with
the
free
shipping
option.
Super
service
&
great
job
PartsGeek!
Package
arrive
with
side
pushed
in.

Since
the
part
had
a
raised
plastic
housing,
cardboard
instead
of
crumpled
paper
should
have
been
used
to
protect
the
fan
housing.

The
housing
was
broken,
but
the
fan
and
blade
were
okay,
so
I
installed
the
motor
in
the
old
plastic
housing.

Works
fine
after
a
little
extra
work.
I
like
others
compare
the
majority
of
purchases
on-line.

I
had
not
been
on
the
Hispec
website
before
but
found
prices
competitive,
it
was
easy
to
place
the
order
and
I
received
the
ordered
item
well
packaged
within
a
few
days
with
free
delivery.
Delivery
service
is
the
fastest
Ive
ever
seen,
from
any
supplier,
some
prices
are
cheaper
elsewhere
but
they
do
help
in
facilitating
American
goods
to
the
UK,
I
believe
this
seller
would
be
helpful
when
problems
arise
as
well,
so
can
be
trusted,which
is
so
important
in
any
business,
overall
I
would
recommended
these
to
others.
About
the
third
time
I
started
over
the
process
of
trying
to
fill
out
the
reservations
request
page
I'd
have
given
minus
one
star
as
the
rating...then
I
realized
that
at
almost
80
the
problem
was
operator
error.
Once
I
read
the
instructions
carefully
and
followed
them
precisely
the
system
worked.
Great
purchase...
Though
the
price
of
the
two
racket
deal
was
penny
more
expensive
than
the
one
racket
deal.
Always
have
what
I
want
for
a
great
price.
Easy
to
choose,
delivered
quickly.
Even
the
garage
were
efficient
always
find
what
I
want
at
good
prices
at
B&H
Very
impressed
with
delivery.
Parcel
undamaged
and
no
problems
Bought
a
lovely
item
from
this
company
which
was
at
least
£6
cheaper
than
at
a
high
street
retailer.
Well
wrapped
and
prompt
delivery
We
decided
to
buy
our
arbour
so
we
could
enjoy
a
further
part
of
our
garden
whilst
avoiding
some
of
the
wind.
We
had
seen
a
similar
model
to
the
one
we
chose
at
our
local
garden
centre
but
didn't
want
a
wood
coloured
one.
After
doing
some
research
on.line
I
found
Garden
Best
Buys
who
stock
the
model
we
wanted
in
sage
and
cream
finish.
The
company
kept
us
fully
informed
by
phone
of
delivery
time.The
arbour
came
well
wrapped
and
was
fairly
easy
to
erect.
The
price
was
great
coming
in
a
good
deal
less
than
other
outlets.
The
best
part
is
that
I've
now
got
extra
flower-beds
around
it
to
satisfy
my
planting
urge
!!!!


A
great
buy
all
round.
Very
impressed
with
service
-
delivered
on
time
and
not
a
bad
price
either.We
even
got
a
small
refund
as
they
managed
to
group
several
nearby
places
together
for
delivery.
Appreciated
the
honesty.
While
booking
the
ferry
service
online,
I
had
a
chance
to
call
contact
centre
twice
and
both
times
the
services
I
got
was
very
effective
and
prompt.
The
online
portal
is
also
very
easy
to
navigate.
This
experience
led
me
to
save
home
page
in
my
favourites
for
my
future
travels.
Perfect!
I
really
recommend
this
company!
Competitively
priced.
Great
customer
service.
Lots
of
stock
to
choose
from.
What
more
could
you
want?
very
good
sevice
and
the
spare
part
was
the
rightone
The
side
view
mirror
I
purchased
for
my
1996
Saturn
was
perfect.
It
was
new,
fit
perfect
and
could
not
have
purchased
for
less
then
I
paid.
Just
an
amazing
buy.
Would
buy
from
Parts
Geek
again.
In
fact
I
will
look
up
their
site
first.
Ordered
20kg
of
chicken
was
great
quality
much
larger
breast
than
I
got
at
the
supermarket
well
packaged
and
chilled
delivers
on
time
and
a
great
price.
Bbq
seasoning
is
also
very
nice.
Only
small
gripe
would
be
chicken
could
have
a
little
more
fat
trimmed
and
freezer
bags
could
be
included
as
some
competitors
do.
But
overall
very
happy
and
will
order
again
next
month.
I
went
to
seamless.com
to
order
a
gift
card
for
my
neighbor
for
Christmas
and
found
that
surprisingly
they
did
not
directly
sell
gift
cards
through
their
site.

When
I
googled
"gift
cards
for
seamless",
giftcards.com
was
one
of
the
first
results.
Ordering
through
giftcards.com
was
fast,
safe,
and
easy
-
what
more
could
I
ask
for
in
holiday
shopping?
The
sunglasses
are
very
beautiful
...
I
got
the
part
I
ordered
in
a
timely
manner.
Best
brands,
great
service
We
looked
at
many
different
sites
before
choosing
to
order
from
here.
The
prices
were
great,
saved
a
load
on
shipping
&
we
got
our
order
faster
than
we
expected.
an
easy
way
to
find
an
accommodation
with
budget
yet

comfortable.
Awesome
little
piece
of
kit,
arrived
in
two
days
over
the
christmas
period.
Fits
in
my
wallet
credit
card
section.
Super
wide
blade
for
its
over
all
size
and
it
dry
shaved
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
my
hand
.
Hard
to
believe
but
this
little
beauty
is
forty
pounds
more
on
amazon.
Used
tennisnuts
several
times.
They
offer
competitive
prices
and
deliver
on
time.
In
the
past
when
I
have
sought
advice
the
staff
have
been
knowledgeable
and
courteous.
Can't
ask
much
more
than
that.
5

here.
My

I
would

I

the
goods
to

Fast

The

awesome
and
the
color
and
printing
of
our

looks
impeccable.
Ramon
was
always
there
to
answer

and
was
proactive
in
getting
me
information,

and
quick

Simple.

You

grrrreeeeaaaat
found
the
part
at
a
great
price,
as
usual
and
it
showed
up
before
I
knew
it.
I
always
check
PartsGeek
for
my
cars!
The
website
was
easy
to
navigate
and
the
pictures
were
greatly
helpful.
Price
was
great
and
part
came
in
two
days.
Thanks.
Being
an
ex
partsman
the
simplicity
of
look-up
and
choice
of
part
preference
was
a
big
plus.
I
also
received
my
part
promptly
and
packed
well
at
time
of
shipment
as
well
!!

Totally
recommend
this
outfit
and
am
thankful
for
them!!
I
would
recomend
this
vendor
to
anyone
who
appreciates
good
service
and
quality
parts.I
recieved
my
egr
valve
in
3
days
and
was
very
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
part.
Great
accuracy
of
the
order,
fast
processing
and
shipping.
I'll
use
them
again!
I
find
the
information
to
be
reliable.
I
use
the
BBC
to
confirm
the
news
stories
in
the
U.S..
I
would
like
to
see
ebay
become
more
involved
in
the
process
I
really
like
the
e-mail
confirmations.
I
also
appreciate
how
fast
amazon
is
at
returning
e-mail
and
answering
query's.
The
shipping
company's
employee
shipped
my
last
order
to
the
wrong
adress.
Supplement
Warehouse
made
it
right.
They
are
good
eggs.
Good
quality
supplements
are
helping
me
to
reach
my
goal.
When
you
are
over
fifty
your
body
needs
a
little
help.
Overall
this
is
an
outstanding
company.
Thanks
and
keep
up
the
good
work
guys!
I
have
ordered
online
a
few
times
and
found
it
very
easy.
All
the
information
I
needed
was
available.
Looked
at
lots
of
insurance
sites.
Protect
your
bubble
was
by
far
the
best
so
I
took
it
:-)
I
have
used
Essential
Travel
on
a
number
of
occasions
for
Holiday
insurance
(including
Scuba
Diving)
and
airport
parking.
Their
prices
are
competitive
and
the
process
is
a
no-
Nonsense
approach.
I
would
reccomend
this
company
I
have
used
iWorld
many
times
and
I
have
to
say
their
service
is
second
to
none.
When
you
do
have
the
occasional
blip
they
rectify
it
quickly
and
without
fuss.
A
great
company
and
good
value.
I
purchased
underfloor
heating
to
go
under
stone
tiles
in
a
bathroom.
I
trawled
the
Ambient
site
for
info
on
buying,
fitting,
delivery
and
whether
the
product
would
suit
my
needs.
I
have
to
say
that
it
did
exactly
what
it
said
on
the
tin.
I
feel
as
though
an
expert
guided
me
through
every
step
and
I
am
absolutely
pleased
with
the
product
and
my
toasty
bathroom
floor
Super
products
in
stock
and
very
swift
delivery.
Will
certainly
order
again.
Amazing
stock,
good
offers,
speedy
delivery
and
so
far
always
a
free
gift.
well,
my
experience
here
was
definatly
a
positive
one,
the
site
was
easy
to
navigate,
everything
you
are
looking
for
accessable,
and
everything
looks
really
top
shelf.
i
made
a
few
orders
now
and
everything
went
flawless,
the
responses
came
qwick,
the
security
felt
safe,
and
the
conformation
emails
qwick
and
informative.
i
was
impressed
with
the
whole
effortless
process,,,
i
havent
had
to
deal
with
problems
yet
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
customer
service
as
of
yet,
hopefully
i
wont
have
to
...
so
from
me,
being
a
huge
online
guy,
and
very
hard
to
impress,
i
would
give
them
an
a++
review,
i
will
be
using
them
all
the
time..
They
are
Great!
i've
searched
all
over
the
place
and
nowhere
else
can
i
find
a
place
with
such
low
prices.
i
can
say
i
will
always
be
a
returning
customer
to
supplement
warehouse!
We
really
didn't
want
to
up
give
up
the
boat,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
little
bit
more
than
we
could
handle
in
our
"old
age".

Pop
Yachts
were
very
helpful
with
the
sale,
and
Mike
stayed
in
touch
with
me
on
a
regular
basis.

This
made
giving
up
my
"retirement
baby"
a
little
easier.
Good
cheap
games
but
recently
had
poor
delivery
times
like

Micheal
was
very
helpful,
knowledgeable,
and
extremely
friendly.
I
will
continue
to
use
Town
Fair
Tire
for
all
my
automotive
needs!
Booking
the
ferry
was
fine.
I
wanted
to
book
meals
(after
getting
info).
NO
LUCK
Very
satisfied
with
my
purchase.
Highly
recommend
using
GBposters
I
frequently
purchase
discounted
gift
cards
here.
I
would
do
more
but
you
can
often
buy
at
Costco
for
less.
Kenda
700c
tube.
Good
tube
at
a
good
price,
especially
when
you
have
points
set
aside.
Good
tube!!
I
had
not
expected
to
get
tyres
of
this
quality
at
such
a
good
price
and
have
them
fitted
at
my
own
convenience
so
near
near
to
home;
no
travelling
across
the
county
for
a
bargain
and
no
hassle
!
I
purchased
an
engagement
ring
from
Brilliance
and
it
was
everything
and
more!!!!

At
first
I
was
alittle
skeptical
because
I
couldn't
see
the
diamond
but
once
I
received
it,
I
was
literally
blown
away!

It
was
bigger
than
I
expected
and
so
clear.

The
representative
assisted
me
the
entire
time,
even
when
I
almost
changed
my
mind
2
times!!!!

I
was
impressed
and
thankful
that
I
found
an
engagement
ring
at
Brillance!!!
B&H
Photovideo
is
always
the
first
place
I
send
people
to
for
this
type
of
gear.

It
is
the
quickest,
most
reliable
and
most
affordable
just
about
everytime
for
anything
I'm
looking
for!

Should
have
a
10
star
rating!!
Had
what
I
wanted,
delivered
as
promissed,
great
value.

Happy
days!
Highly
recommend
Since
I
tend
to
wait
to
the
last
miinute
to
place
the
vast
majority
of
my
orders
I
rarely
take
the
time
to
shop
around.

I
am
doing
that
now.

Only
you
have
the
numbers
to
review
this
policy
and
comparisons
to
other
providers.

I
am
thinking
that
some
combination
of
triggers
could
make
this
more
palatable
to
you.
eg:
If
a
customer
is

a
repeat
customer
AND
spends
at
least
$50
in
the
last
three
months
could
trigger
free
delivery.
OR,
you
could
track
customer
buying
and
offer
the
customer
free
shipping
if
they(me)
instead
of
waiting
until
the
last
minute
your
tracking
could
tell
me
to
purchase
more
products
a
few
times
a
year
instead
of
waiting
until
the
last
minute.

You
get
a
bigger
order
and
I
get
free
shipping.
Can't
wait
for
next
order.Good
deal
have
purchased
lots
from
this
company
all
good
price
with
great
delivery
service
only
complaint
there
is
always
a
change
in
customer
service
attitude
when
you
dont
take
up
the
extra
insurance
offer
better
left
to
try
when
warranty
is
out
like
others
do
Exceeded
my
expectations!
Good
after
sales
notifications,
invoices
and
delivery.

All
at
very
cheap
prices
and
very
reasonable
shipping
for
fast
delivery.

Highly
recommend
Hot
Toner.
Bought
it
on
line
and
had
it
delivered
to
my
residence
for
less
than
Wal-mart
charges.
Purchased
a
replacement
passenger-side
mirror
for
my
2000
Mustang
GT.
Shipping
was
lightning
fast,
the
part
was
good
quality,
and
the
price
was
right.
I
will
shop
here
again.
My
total
experience
with
TAX
SOLUTIONS
was
very
professional,
courteous,
knowledgeable,
and
timely.
They
seemed
to
have
a
wide
selection
at
reasonable
prices.
Not
happy
with
the
way
I
was
treated.

Given
a
window
of
3
to
5.

Technician
calls
me
from
Galveston,
1-1/2
hours
away
to
troubleshoot
over
the
phone,
which
they
were
unable
to
previously.

I
was
under
the
impression
that
a
tech
would
be
coming
to
my
house.

Played
along,
and
he
said
I
think
its
the
battery
or
the
contact.

Wanted
to
see
if
it
was
covered
before
I
knew
how
much
It
would
be.

138.00.....For
a
service
call
and
a
5.00
contact.

And
even
if
I
wanted
to
buy
my
own
contact
and
have
the
system
recognize
it,
they
said
I
cant.

Its
in
the
contract...LOL.

Guess
what.
it's
cheaper
to
cancel
the
contract
and
have
another
company
install
a
brand
new
system.


When
I
called
to
customer
service...
the
guy
seemed
like
he
was
right-fighting
me
but
kept
trying
to
say
we're
saving
you
money..
Whatever.

been
without
an
alarm
for
5
days.

Truly
not
happy
with
their
service.

However,
the
1st
installer
they
sent
out
was
awesome...Wish
I
had
his
number..
:(

Try
another
company
1st.
For
California
shoppers,
it's
a
no-brainer.
These
days
lots
of
products
from
B&H
come
with
free
expedited
shipping.
And
no
sales
tax
saves
me
at
least
8%.
And
they
offer
payment
by
Google
checkout
-
quick
&
easy
for
me.
Lowest
prices.
Easy
returns
(if
you
ever
need
them).
At
work
we
always
use
B&H
(since
1996).
So
why
not
at
home
too?
Makes
sense.
Thanks
B&H
for
keeping
your
prices
the
lowest,
and
providing
great
customer
service.
I
went
ahead
and
saved
myself
an
extra
$10
by
ordering
through
Wiggle.
"I
can
wait
a
little
longer",
I
told
myself.
"After
all,
with-in-10
business
days
to
the
United
States
seems
like
a
long
time,
but
I
can
wait.
"
Big
mistake.
Here
I
am
over
half
a
month
later
with
no
item,
and
losing
valuable
training
time
by
the
day.
I
contacted
Wiggle
after
10
business
days
and
I
was
told
it
would
take
them
up
to
48
hours
to
respond
to
an
email.
(At
least
they
met
that
time
frame)
.
I
did
not
receive
an
update
or
estimated
time
of
delivery
on
my
item.
I
was
simply
told
that
I
could
not
be
helped
until
25
business
days.
Yes,
I
have
to
wait
for
over
a
month
before
I
can
even
begin
to
get
my
money
back
or
report
an
item
lost.
I
could
have
waited
a
little
longer
than
if
I
had
ordered
through
Amazon,
but
this
is
just
way
too
long,
and
with
absolutely
no
updates
or
tracking
no.-this
is
just
blind
shopping.

I
fully
regret
ordering
through
Wiggle.
I'm
from
Brazil,
did
not
know
of
anyone
who
had
bought
the
Merlin,
I
found
the
site
by
chance,
risked
buy
the
water
bottle,
arrived
fast
and
perfect,
bought
air
chambers,
arrived
fast
and
perfect.
From
now
on
I
will
only
buy
the
Merlin,
because
honesty
and
variety
of
products
here
in
Brazil
we
do
not
find.
I
searched
all
my
local
hardware
stores
trying
to
find
a
close
match
to
existing
letters
without
success.
DIY
was
easy
and
fast.
One
of
the
items
in
my
order
was
the
wrong
length,
which
is
a
bummer,
but
not
worth
the
effort
to
returning.
Couldent
ask
for
better
help!
After
a
5
minute
conservation
i
got
all
the
information
and
products
i
needed!
Great
customer
service!
Parts
geek
always
have
everything
I
need...especially
those
hard
to
find
parts
that
these
local
part
stores
just
don't
have..and
at
great
prices
Christmas
was
less
than
a
week
away
when
our
very
junior
and
novice
Onnit
supplements,
gear,
podcasts,
and
enthusiasm
has
changed
how
I
work
out
and
how
I
better
myself
physically
and
mentally.
I
am
thrilled
Onnit
produces
so
many
products
for
a
range
of
abilities
and
strengths
and
tastes.
My
wife
and
I
are
also
grateful
Onnit
ships
overseas
to
the
military.
We
appreciate
Onnit
and
it's
team,
thank
you!
I
got
the
wrong
part
inside
the
right





part
box,
but
why
should
it
cost
me
to
fix
it?
I
was
given
a
quote
for
annual
insurance
and
when
I
emailed
to
query
why
it
had
gone
up
so
much
from
last
year
was
given
a
slightly
lower
figure.I
rang
to
take
up
the
revised
quote
as
I
was
about
to
depart
on
a
trip
and
required
continuity
of
cover
but
was
then
asked
for
the
original
figure
and
told
the
second
quote
did
not
include
the
admin
fee!
In
fairness
after
discussion
and
some
consultation
the
second
quote
was
honoured
without
the
admin
fee.
Easy
to
use
and
straight
forward
and
will
highly
recommend
it
I
can
only
speak
highly
of
PDH
sport
and
whole
heartily
recommend
them.
I
only
ordered
1
assembly
the
first
time
because
I
was
suspicious
because
of
the
low
price.
When
I
received
The
bulb
socket
I
order
for
my
mercedes
turn
signal
worked,
but
the
bulb
itself
was
the
wrong
bulb.

Not
worth
fussing
over.
I'm
only
kidding
but
I'm
sure
our
Square
Trade
warranties
with
accidental
drop
coverage
has
made
me
a
lot
easier
to
get
along
with
because
my
wife
breaks
everything!

First
it
was
her
Kindle
and
then
her
iPhone!

The
process
to
file
the
claims
on
both
were
easy
and
each
was
settled
literally
in
a
matter
of
hours.
If
it
wasn't
for
Square
Trade
she'd
be
back
on
a
land
line,
calling
me
from
the
library!

I
keep
telling
her
that
I
wouldn't
be
surprised
to
see
her
picture
on
the
Square
Trade
website
with
a
red
circle
and
slash
through
it,
barring
future
coverage
on
her
electronic
handhelds,
but
it
hasn't
happened
yet!
AFEyewear
has
a
wide
variety
of
"top
of
the
line"
sunglasses
for
a
discounted
rate.

I
purchased
the
Ray
Bans
New
Wayfarer
for
over
35
dollars
off
and
i
received
free
shipping.

There
was
also
a
setback
in
verifying
my
military
affiliation
but
a
quick
call
to
customer
service
cleared
it
up
in
no
time.

Very
satisfied
with
my
purchase
and
will
defiantly
be
using
them
again.
I
used
to
go
to
the
Attleboro
store
but
they
seem
to
be
too
busy
to
give
me
the
individual
attention
I
would
like
when
making
a
purchase.

As
I
found
out
the
two
guys
who
helped
me(Rusty
and
Matt)
used
to
work
there
&
remembered
me
&
my
car.

I
got
a
great
price
&
was
done
in
an
hour.

They
seemed
to
have
alot
of
fun
together.

They
were
cracking
jokes
not
just
w/
each
other,
w/
the
customers
as
well.

They
all
seem
to
work
great
together,
have
fun,
&
care
about
each
other
like
family,
which
you
don't
find
often
in
this
line
of
work.

They
treat
all
their
customers(atleast
while
I
was
there)
as
if
they
were
family
making
everyone
happy
&
laughing.

As
long
as
those
guys
stay
in
that
store
my
family,
myself,
&
all
my
friends
will
go
there
for
life.
Ordered
a
sleeping
bag
online
on
Sunday
afternoon,
and
it
arrived
on
the
Wednesday.

Excellent
service
for
a
'free
delivery'
item.

Cannot
comment
on
the
product
as
it
was
a
present
and
is
as
yet
unopened.
I
bought
a
break
master
cylinder
for
my
sons
97
Land
Rover.
He
is
stuck
out
in
Penn
Valley
Ca.
It
went
out
when
he
was
traveling
and
they
told
him
they
had
to
order
the
part
from
Land
Rover
and
this
could
take
two
weeks.
I
went
on
Parts
Geek
,com
and
they
had
five
to
pick
from.
The
first
two
said
W/O
reservoir
and
they
DID
NOT
show
the
reservoir
on
them.
The
next
one
down
DID
NOT
say
W/O
reservoir
and
IT
DID
SHOW
the
reservoir
on
the
master
cylinder.
So
i
ordered
that
one,
When
they
got
it
out
in
Ca.
They
called
me
and
said
it
did
not
come
with
the
reservoir.
I
called
Partd
Geek,
I
WAS
ON
HOLD
FOR
TWO
AND
A
HALF
HOURS!!!!!!
No
one
picked
up.
I
had
to
order
a
reservoir
from
Land
Rover
$128.00
My
son
has
been
stuck
in
Ca.
for
almost
two
weeks.
Parts
Geek
just
says
sorry
and
return
it.
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME!!
The
website
is
SO
misleading.
I
fix
all
my
cars
and
trucks
myself.
I
WILL
NEVER
BUY
FROM
YOU
AGAIN.I
have
NEVER
in
my
life
ever
taken
the
time
to
complain
about
customer
service.
I
work
in
customer
service
and
I
know
things
can
happen.
But
this
was
just
OVER
THE
TOP
BAD!!!!
I
live
in
Delaware
and
I
was
trying
to
help
my
son
who
is
stuck
on
the
west
coast.
THANKS
AND
MERRY
CHRISTMAS!!!!!
Good
prices,
good
service
-
totally
reliable
I
ordered
a
couple
of
Walker
02
Sensors
for
my
Ferrari
348,
not
only
did
they
beat
everyone
else's
prices
they
delivered
it
quickly.
The
web
site
is
easy
to
use
and
the
jacket
I
ordered
came
very
quickly.
I
have
been
guided
and
helped
by
Argus
Car
Hire
very
often,
when
renting
a
car
overseas
and
locally.
They
have
given
me
the
best
deal,
best
prices
and
the
best
car
rental
company
that
showed
me
the
utmost
courtesy,
respect
and
expertise
in
their
industry.
Well
done
on
top
reliable
service.
It's
a
pleasure
doing

business
with
you.
They
have
good
prices
on
hard
to
find
parts.
They
seam
to
have
all
and
any
parts
that
I
need.
The
shipping
department
could
use
a
little
help.
The
part
was
damaged
a
bit
and
was
not
done
during
transient
since
the
box
was
not
damaged.
If
you
have
time
to
wait
on
your
parts
you
save
a
lot
of
money!
Just
booked
a
cruise
with
cruise
sale
finder
it
was
clearly
set
out
and
very
easy
to
arrange.

All
instructions
were
clear
and
easy
to
follow.
The
Cruise

Specialist
arranged
to
link
our
booking
with
my
daughters
so
we
are
at
the
same
Dining
Table,
same
sitting
for
meals.
Now
I
cannot
wait
until
May
28th
when
we
cruise
the

easy

Easy

to
navigate,
my
shipment
arrived
in
3
days,
I
am
posting
this
from
Maine.
Ive
bought
several
parts
from
this
site.
Quality
of
parts
is
amazing.
I
like
the
fact
that
you
can
choose
to
buy
more
exspensive
aftermarket
parts
giving
you
lots
of
options.
They
have
sent
I
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
Partgeek.com.
I
ordered
several
parts
for
my
79
Chevy
K-5
Blazer
not
knowing
what
to
expect
since
it
was
my
first
time
to
order
from
Partsgeek.
Not
only
did
they
have
many
of
the
hard
to
find
parts
I
needed
the
prices
where
very
competitive.
I
have
to
admit
I
was
skeptical
but

Partgeek
came
through
with
flying
colors.
Everything
I
ordered
was
promptly
shipped
and
arrived
on
time
as
promised.
I
bookmarked
their
website
in
my
web
browser
favorites
and
will
definitely
be
ordering
from
them
in
the
future.
Bought

Installed

Shopto.net
have
always
provided
me
with
great
service,
the
fact
that
games
can
turn
up
to
your
door
the
day
after
purchase
is
brilliant.
Free
postage
on
your
games
is
also
a
great
plus
point
and
I
am
yet
to
see
a
game
fail
to
be
delivered
to
me
on
time.
The
point
scheme
also
works
out
great
due
to
the
number
of
games
I
buy.
Product
was
damaged
but
I
was
able
to
some
old
parts
to
get
my
wife's
van
going.

We
are
really
pleased
with
our
American

we
used
the

a
good
idea
of

my

for

have
ordered

No

I
like
the
variety
of
products
on
your
site.
The
prices
are
always
close
to
the
cheapest
on
the
web
if
not
the
cheapest.
Of

the

are
a
great
way
to
try
new

and
see
if
you
like
them
before
spending
your
hard

I
would
like
to
see
better

and
a
more

on

Overall
it
is
still
my
favorite
place
to
shop.
Thanks
for
the
great

a
while
ago
and
am
now
trying
New
Mood.

Both
products
are
very
impressive,
they
are
just
a
bit
pricey.

However,
considering
New
Mood
helps
with
depression,
being
happy
is
priceless.

It's
natural
and
organic.

I
have
no
complaints
with
the
ordering
process,
other
than
the
coupon
code
is
hard
to
find
(I'm
blind
and
use
a
screen
reader).
I
have
been
getting
MTB
for
9
months
and
I
can't
wait
to
get
my
box
every
month.I
get
about
double
in
lures
then
what
it
costs
me.
I
like
the
variety
that
I
get
from
top
water
to
jigs
and
its
not
some
cheep
junk.
they
also
give
you
a
card
to
tell
you
the
price
of
each
lure
and
even
how
and
where
to
use
it.I
would
have
to
say
MTB
made
me
a
better
fishermen.
When
I
bought
diablo
3
I
was
under
the
assumption
that
I
had
the
global
EU
version,
even
for
that
price.
But
instead,
what
I
got
was
a
russian
limited
version
where
I
can
only
play
in
russian.
Now
I
have
to
buy
a
new
gamecode
to
be
able
to
play
the
game
in
English.
I
have
contacted
the
website
but
no
response
yet
I
would
never
buy
anything
from
parts
geek
and
I
would
never
recommend
them
to
anyone.
Good
part,
good
deal
,
fast
shipping..I
will
buy
from
partsgeek
again
Bought
off
eBay
first
(paid
too
much),
then
found
these
guys
and
paid
a
little
less
than
half
for
the
same
stuff.

Done
and
done.
Excellent
product
and
under
the
severe
weather
circumstances,

perfect
Not
being
fully
compouter
literate,
my
son
built
up
a
gaming
PC
and
ordered
as
required.
When
it
came
time
for
me
to
get
incorporated,
obtain
my
EIN,
file
as
an
S
Corp,
and
have
the
lease
of
my
soon
to
be
coffee
shop
looked
at
I
was
actually
quoted
as
high
as
$14k.

There
was
just
no
way
that
could
happen.

Had
I
been
a
seasoned
Entrepreneur
and
business
owner
who’s
done
this
many
times
maybe
I’d
have
more
money
to
play
with
and
more
experience
to
keep
me
calm,
but
this
was
not
the
case.

So
I
did
some
searching
on
the
internet
right
away!

Initially
I
wanted
to
learn
how
to
incorporate
myself
as
to
only
pay
the
required
state
fees
instead
of
dealing
with
cold
lawyers
and
outrageous
fees.

And
they
did
seem
cold.

I
ended
up
running
into
something
better.

Through
Nevada
Corporate
Headquarters
I
ONLY
paid
state
fees
for
getting
incorporated,
obtaining
my
EIN,
and
file
as
an
S
Corp;
and
all
with
the
help
of
AJ
V.
who
was
(and
is)
amazing
to
work
with.

Communication
has
been
so
easy
and
delightful,
and
a
different
vibe
altogether
in
comparison
to
the
colder
and
personality-less
lawyers
I've
spoken
to.

AJ
is
quite
personable
and
incredibly
helpful,
always
making
sure
that
if
he
can
help
me
with
what
I
need
he
will.

Through
AJ
I
was
able
to
receive
an
additional
service
I
needed.

I
was
able
to
have
someone
at
Nevada
Corporate
Headquarters
review
my
lease
for
less
than
$500.00.

Previous
lawyers
I’ve
spoken
to
wanted
$1,600,
and
another
$2,000
just
to
look
at
the
lease.

Not
only
did
I
most
certainly
not
pay
$14k
I
couldn't
possibly
afford,
but
I
didn’t
even
pay
$1,600
to
get
incorporated,
obtain
my
EIN,
file
as
an
S
Corp,
and
have
my
lease
reviewed.

And
I
had
enough
money
left
over
to
tackle
the
other
details
of
my
coffee
shop
like
construction.

I’m
really
appreciative
of
Nevada
Corporate
Headquarters
and
AJ
V,
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
lovely
people
of
the
staff
who
I've
had
the
pleasure
of
communicating
with.

They
help
new
businesses
in
their
beginning
steps
(very
important
steps)
without
charging
typical
outrageous
fees-
you
only
pay
your
state’s
fees.

Although
saving
money
can
be
a
big
deal
for
a
lot
of
us
my
favorite
part
about
Nevada
Corporate
Headquarters
is
honestly
the
smooth
experience
with
these
very
kind
and
understanding
people-
not
words
I
had
associated
with
lawyers
previously..
they
just
weren't.

Everyone
I
tell
my
story
to
takes
note.

If
you're
opening
a
business
I
hope
you
do
too!

I

I
was
looking
for
a

chairs
for

So
glad
I
came
across

Great
price,

a
quality
product!
To

it
all
off,
I
even
received

I
will
definitely
use
and
recommend
AGS
again!
The
price
for
the
bike
computer
and
bundle
was
the
best
I
could
find.
I
was
hesitant
buying
from
overseas,
but
I
went
ahead
after
reading
the
experiences
of
others
who
had
also
bought
from
overseas.
The
package
came
in
time
and
I
am
happy
with
the
purchase.
I
am
a
15+
year
customer,
with
no
reason
to
change.

Keep
up
the
great
work.
We
noticed
out
freezer
had
stopped
working
and
needed
a
new
device
quickly.
We
wanted
the
same
device
as
we
have
matching
fridge
and
washing
machine.
I
looked
at
the
major
online
suppliers
and
phoned
around
the
large
department
stores
to
be
told
I
would
have
to
wait
about
7
working
days
for
said
appliance.
I
found
this
site
and
checked,
I
was
surprised
they
had
the
device
in
stock,
it
was
only
a
couple
of
pounds
more
expensive
than
the
other
online
suppliers
and

could
deliver
the
next
day
for
a
nomial
delivery
price.
I
actualy
went
for
the
ECO
delivery
day
they
offer
as
well
which
was
only
2
days
later.
Over
all
very
impressed
with
service
from
begining
to
end.
Would
recommned
on
my
experience
and
use
Appliance
online
again
for
future
purchases
I've
ordered
a
number
of
items
from
Heinnie
Haynes
over
the
past
few
years
and
without
exception
they've
always
been
delivered
very
promptly.
I
have
now
used
Tennisnuts
several
times
and
the
service
is
absolutely
first
class.
The
quality,
cost
etc
matches
anything
I
have
found.
Have
ordered
racquets,
tennis
shoes
and
was
so
pleased
with
everything!
I
have
been
buying
from
them
for
over
8
years
now
and
can
honestly
say
they
are
the
best
suppliers
I
have
bought
from.
Nothing
is
ever
too
much
trouble.
WYSIWYG..........What
you

is
what
you

-

Disappointing
I
visited
miami
for
the
first
time
in
late
april
of
2014.

I
was
in
south
beach
but
wanted
to
see
more
then
just
the
beach.

I
saw
trip
advisor
recommended
the
miami
tour
company.
I'm
so
glad
they
did.

I
booked
a
trip
to
see
the
sights
of
miami
and
go
see
the
eveglades.

It
was
awesome.

The
tour
guide
was
funny
and
informative.

The
miami
tour
company
does
not
rush
the
tour.

They
allow
you
time
to
soak
up
the
sights.
When
i
go
back
to
miami
(soon)
i
will
book
another
tour
with
the
miami
tour
company.
The
best
We
were
completely
satisfied
with
the
parts
received.

However,
we
did
receive
one
incorrect
part.

Had
immediate
response
that
the
correct
part
would
be
shipped
7-23-12.

As
of
8-3-12,
no
part,
and
no
response.

What
is
happening????
Very
bad.

Unacceptable
experience.


I'm
now
stuck
with
a
bunch
of
filters
that
I
paid
for
that
don't
fit.
They
say
the
width
is
5"
but
they
actually
measure
5
1/4"
in
width
and
thus
don't
work.
Need
a
prescrition
for
special
diet,
they
took
care
of
everything.

It
doesn't
get
any
better
that
this.
Cheap

Fast,

else

I
really
like
Onnit's
products,
their
fast
and
reliable
deliveries,
and
the
variety
of
products
they
sell.
The
guys
behind
Onnit
are
dedicated
and
motivated
individuals
who
are
constantly
trying
to
improve
their
physical
and
physiological
performance,
and
they
want
to
share
their

with
the
world.
The
products

are

in

compared
to
anything
on

gotten
to

some
of
the
guys
behind
the

on
various
podcasts,
and
I
want
to
say
keep
up
the
good
work!
Only
reason
I
didn't
give
a
5

is
because
I'm
a
college
student
who
can't
afford
to
have
a
constant
supply
of
the

Oh
yea,
and
Maybe

a
little

Very

can't

anything,
just
hope
the

meets
these

I
am

they
will
do.

As
a
"home
mechanic",
I
try
to
save
money
on
shop
labor,
but
I
will
only
use
top
quality
parts!

As
a
returning
customer,
I'm
very
happy
with
the
quality
of
parts
and
great
prices
from
Partsgeek!
From
now
on,
this
is
my
parts
store!
Well
not
quite
that
easy,
but
almost.
This
was
my
first
time
using
partsgeek
and
it
was
easy
to
find
the
part
I
needed
and
it
was
cheaper
then
anywhere
else
I
checked
online.
Fast
delivery,
No
hassles
I
love
coming
here
to
get
my
photo
supplies.

Prices
are
always
very
good
and
the
service
is
second
to
none.

Just
need
to

very
satisfied.
Will

I
was
astonished
to
find
that
this
"travel
service"
charged
my
credit
card
THREE
times
for
the
same,
one
night
hotel
stay.
When
I
called
to
complain
I
was
told
that
the
2
erroneous
charges
would
be
reversed,
plus
the
$1:00
charges
to
'make
sure
I
had
money
in
the
account"
(what?),
and
was
given
confirmation
numbers
for
these
reversal
which
were
supposed
to
take
place
within
24
hours.

When
I
called
back,
25
hours
later
I
was
told
that
there
were
no
erroneous
charges
and
that
the
confirmation
numbers
I
had
been
given
"did
not
mean
anything".
WOW,
what
an
awesome
shopping
experience
I
had
at
Urban
Girl
!!!!
Not
only
did
they
carry
the
product
Tyvek
envelopes
that
I
needed
and
could
not
find
anywhere
else
for
anything
less
than
$1.00
a
piece
but
had
100
envelopes
under
$30.00.
They
beat
out
Amazon
for
price
as
well.
YAHOOOOOOO!!!

Also,
saved
on
the
100
1/3
cut
manilla
file
folders.
They
beat
out
all
other
places!!
Saved
money
there
too.
Really
they
have
awesome
prices,
fast
ship,
and
packaging
was
perfect
and
so
were
my
products.
Thank
you
Urban
Girl,
you
saved
me
a
lot
of
bucks.
Have
a
great
day
and
I
will
definitely
be
purchasing
from
you
again.
YES
you
bet,

I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
They
won't
be
sorry!
Delivered

and

Have
been
shopping
B
H
for
over
30
years.

The
only
place
to
get
photography
items
They
always
have
what
I'm
looking
for.
I
might
be
able
to
find
cheaper
prices
elsewhere
from
time
to
time,
but
I
know
I
won't
have
a
hassle
and
am
willing
to
pay
a
few
extra
bucks
for
that.
I
recently
had
an
issue
changing
my
password.
Lauren
in
customer
service
was
very
helpful
trying
to
address
my
problem.
I
always
feel
like
a
valued
customer!
I
ordered
my
part
on
5/23/14
it
is
now
6/2/14
and
I
will
not
get
my
part
until
6/5/14.
Really
this
is
nuts,
it
should
not
take
15
days
for
me
to
get
my
product
even
with
standard
shipping.
I
wanted
a
reservation
for
the
next
day.
I
called
on
Sunday
and
told
the
clerk
I
needed
a
room
for
tomorrow.
To
my
surprise
when
I
looked
at
the
confirmation
Email
it
said
I
had
a
reservation
for
Tues,
(not
Mon.).
When
I
called
back
to
get
it
straightened
out
I
was
told
there
would
be
a
change
charge.
($7.00).
I
then
told
them
to
cancel
the
entire

as
I
would
not
pay
to
correct
a
mistake
that
they
made.
I'm
so
happy
I
chose
Armstrong
Steel
for
my
building.
After
doing
much
research,
Armstrong
had
the
most
to
offer
for
the
cost.
My
building
has
been
erected
for
nearly
2
years
and
I
still
receive
many
compliments
on
the
look
and
finish.
Anyone
who
is
considering
a
pole
building,
should
first
contact

Armstrong
Steel.
It's
a
much
better
alternative.
These
specs
were
very
good
value.
But
the
issues
I
have
with
them
are:
I
would
rate
the
service
received
from
Hunt
Office
as
the
best.
Good
service
no
issues.
We
order
all
sorts
of
odd
lots
of
odd
bolts,
Bolt
Depot
always
takes
care
of
us...
The
customer
service
was
fantastic,
I
called
with
a
bunch
of
questions
and
they
were
answered
accurately
and
immediately.

Two
thumbs
up
all
around.
I
am
sad
and
dissapointed
because
I
ordred
light
brown
on
line
and
then
called
customer
service
and
was
told
that
my
order
would
be
changed
to
grey
and
then
a
couple
of
days
later
I
recieved
the
light
brown.
Not
what
I

wanted
or
will
ever
use!
Customer
Service
was
excellent.

Pricing
can't
be
beat.
At
the
same
airport,
same

price
with
service
charge
is
vastly
differant.
Buyer
beware.
Having
researched
oak
worktops
online,
Worktop
Express
came
up
top
on
price,
quality
and
user
reviews.
I
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
fabrication
process
as
we
required
a
cut
out
for
a
belfast
sink
and
drainage
grooves
as
well
as
profiled
edges,
irregular
cuts
and
tap
holes.
We
had
an
issue
with
a
small
crack
appearing
across
a
knot,
but
they
offered
to
collect
the
worktop
and
repair
it.
As
I
had
already
installed
it
I
opted
to
repair
myself
but
was
pleased
the
offer
was
made
by
them.
I
will
be
ordering
from
them
again
shortly,
once
the
remaining
part
of
my
new
kitchen
has
been
installed.
I
ordered
a
Shaws
butler
sink,
basket
strainer
and
bridge
tap
as
they
were
the
cheapest
I
could
find
online
for
Shaws
products
plus
their
delivery
charges
are
nominal.
I
needed
to
add
an
additional
item
to
my
order
(Shaws
sink
grid)
which
had
only
just
come
out
and
they
sent
it
out
the
day
after
I
received
the
other
items
which
was
great.
Overall
a
fantastic
service

price

said
no

until
I
double
checked
everything.
When
I
brought
up
the
mistake...He
then
said
there
was
a
problem.

in

my
mistake.

I
ordered
an

for

from
Parts
Geek.

They
sent
the
wrong
one.

I
couldn't
call
them
or
reach
them
by
email
for
several
days.

When
I
finally
did
reach
them
to
explain
the
situation,
it
took
them
another
5
days
to
decide
to
give
me
a
return
authorization
number.

And
of
course,
I
had
to
pay
$22
to
ship
it
back
to
them
when
it
definitely
wasn't
my
fault
in
the
first
place.

This
merchant
definitely
has
a
very
bad
attitude.

I
would
strongly
recommend
everyone
steer

of
these

PartsGeek
came
up

The

The

the
notes

were
detailed

They
have
good

in

with
the

the

the

a
company
who
I
know
will
not
"disappear"
before
the
date
of

Overall
I
was
extremely
happy
with
the
experience,
and
would
use
this

in
the

Hi,
My
wife
backed
her
car
into
another
parked
car
and
shattered
her
passenger
tail
light.
I
went
to
the
local
Kia
dealership
and
asked
about
the
part.
He
told
me
the
part
was
$173
and
the
labor
was
$59.
I
thought
this
was
outrageous.
I
looked
everywhere
with
no
success.
I

then
found
this
website
called
PartsGeek.
The
part
was
$64
and
$77.28
shipped.
Less
than
one
week
later
I
received
the
entire
tail
light
assembly
in
my
hands,
BULBS
AND
ALL!

I
am
somewhat
mechanically
inclined
and
most
things
come
natural
to
me.
All
I
needed
was
a
nut
driver,
a
few
twists
and
my
wife
was
ready
to
get
her
car
inspected.
This
is
a
very
reputable
company.
Thanks
They
did
a
great
job
on
their
transcription.

They
even
spelled
some
of
the
contextual
names
properly.
Excellent

Great

no

After
searching,
searching,
searching
on
the
internet
for
what
seemed
like
hours,
making
phone
calls,
and
doing
live
chats
all
to
no
avail;
I
found
PartsGeek!

What
a
relief.
Found
a
cheaper
price
for
the
same
product
on
Ebay.
However,
SupplementWarehouse
had
a
function
that
enabled
them
to
match
and
beat
the
competitor's
price.
I
am
impressed
and
will
definitely
buy
from
them
again.
Amazing
price,
speedy
delivery,
crummy
web

and

Kinda
hard
to
find
specific
parts
and
some
mis-categorized.
Check
part
numbers
before
ordering,
and
with
prices
as
low
as
their,
don't
expect
customer

like

I
was
not
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the

I
ordered.
It
was
made
with
very
ordinary

and
did
not

I

I
have
been
ordering
stickers
from
Websticker.com
for
about
5
years
now
and
have
always
been
very
pleased
wit
their
prompt
and
courteous
service.
They
have
always
provided
me
with
nice
clear,
well
printed
stickers
and
have
been
very
helpful
in
assisting
me
with
my
designs.
I
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
looking
for
printed
products
for
their
business
or
events.
Made
team
were
helpful,
respectful
and
changed
delivery
dates
to
help
with
my
move.
The
delivery
team
'Dales'
were
excellent,
polite
and
it
couldn't
have
been
better.
I
was
amazed.
The
whole
experience
of
choosing,
buying,
arranging
and
delivering
a
significant
number
of
items
was
completely
painless
and
I'd
do
it
again
without
question.
Wish
they'd
told
me
about
the
'euro'
adapter
on
the
plug
-
is
a
cumbersome
and
silly
problem
that
swapping
for
a
UK
version
(or
supplying
one
at
a
reduced
price)
would
have
made
fitting
it
all
much
simpler
than
it
became.
The
whole
experience
was
excellent.
The
product
range
is
superb
and
the
customer
service
over
the
phone
was
charming
and
well
considered.
The
site
could
be
simpler,
and
I'd
like
to
be
able
to
save
orders
for
later
as
I
build
a
basket.
Only
issue
was
packaging...
the
use
of
polystyrene
was
crazy.
It
took
me
nearly
20
mins
to
pack
it
all
into
bin
bags,
and
I
have
to
take
it
to
the
tip
because
it
can't
be
recycled.
This
is
enough
of
an
issue
for
me
to
re-consider
using
your
service,
so
please
find
a
more
eco-friendly
way
of
packaging.
Your
company
always
saves
me
time
and
money.

Products

I
was
trying
to
order
lower

for

by
calling
the
1-800
number.
I
was
unable
to
get
anyone
to
answer
the
phone
ever
time
I
called.
I
was
Leary
spending
1200.00
without
talking
to
a
person.
Finally
I
just
gave
in
and
ordered
them
on
line.
They
came
to
my
house
in
2
days
by
UPS.
I
was
very
happy
with
the
quality
and
the

fit
perfectly.
I'll
deff
order
parts
again
from
you
guys
in

Thank

I'm
a
eager
user
of
Steam,
and
I
often
buy
steam
games,
but
my
main
problem
is
the
very
steep
price
of
those
games.
I
then
one
day
found
OKS,
(OnlineKeyStore),
and
discovered
that
I
could
get
Steam
game-keys
almost
50%
cheaper.
I
haven't
bought
any
AAA
titles
from
Steam
since
then,
always
through
OKS.
You
have
to
test
this
site
out
and
compare.
Amazing
savings
and
delivered
right
to
my

I
purchased
a
Lochcarron
lambswool
scarf,
it's
very
cozy.

I'm
in
the

but
still
received
it
very
quickly.

I
was
very
satisfied
with
my
purchase.

I
purchased

I

There
were
four

to
our

On
two
of
them,
we
had
to
purchase

wouldn't

any

at
all.

How
can

Great!

I'm

Great
service
guys.
I'll
be
back
and
I've
told
heaps
of
people
about
you
already.

Oh
by
the
way
the
product
is
great
too.
Its
1/3
the
price
of
the
similar
generic
product
@
Officeworks

Harvey

Why
would
you
not
buy
from
Hot
Toner?
Great
prices,
good
parts.

The
parts
came
from
multiple
warehouses.

Two
packages
showed
up
in
a
couple
days
however
the
third
package
took
over
a
week.

If
I'd
have
known
it
was
going
to
be
that
slow
I
would
have
bought
local.
I
think
these
guys
and
gals
are
great.
I
continue
to
get
good
service.
Haven't
purchased
anything
for
awhile,
then
grabbed
a
couple
items
the

from
a

I
forgot
about.
Will
continue
to
use

for

I
made
a
mistake
and
purchased
the
wrong

from

crazy.
I
contacted
them
and
dealt
with
Francis.
Francis
went
above
and
beyond.
He
set
up
a
pick
up
with
fedex
and
had
my
new

delivered
in
a
timely
manner.
Great
experience...
I
will
recommend
to
all
my

the
best

I've
used.
The

nearly
flawless,
the

outstanding,
the
shipping
is
fast
and
normally
free,
and
they
always
have
the
best
prices
I
can
find.
Definitely
my
favorite
place
to
shop!
I
ordered
a

Pro
on
the
9th
September
for
£34.00
and
payment
was
taken
from
my
card
on
the
following
day.

The
website
stated
5-7
days
for
delivery
yet
I'd
received
nothing
by
the
17th
so
I
chased
via
the
online
chat
and
got
no
answer
although
I
did
receive
an
email
later
advising
they
were
waiting
from
the
distributor
to
re-stock
so
fair
enough
I
waited.
I
was
initially
skeptical

never

I
can
now
add
my

These

Gotta
admit,
They
were
as
fast
in

the

as
I`ve
read
in

from

I
started

pretty
quick,
and
if
I
was
ever
really
in

I
would`nt
hesitate

me.

Parts
allways
work
great
but
when
u
have
a
core
to
send
back
its
a
pain
i
had
two
brake
calipers
that
i
sent
back
and
never
got
the
100
dollar
core
back.
I
went
to
this
store
the
other
day
with
a
flat
tire
and
no
replacement.
Not
only
that
but
I
needed
to
get
the
tires
on
my
car
by
2:30
pm
in
order
to
make
it
into
work
on
time.
Due
to
the
specialty
tire
that
I
had
there
were
no
tires
in
the
store
that
fit
my
truck.
Steve
was
working
and
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
call
multiple
stores
and
see
if
they
would
be
able
to
go
to
the
warehouse
and
pick
up
the
tires
so
I
could
make
it
to
work
on
time.
Unfortunately
it
didn't
work
in
my
favor
but
he
did
try.
I
was
looking
for
a
pair
of
Kinvaras
to
use

All
the

searches
led
to

Suspects"
box
shifters.
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
price
and
the
part
was
delivered
promptly.

Thanks
I
was
a
little
apprehensive
before

I
would

I
have
purchased
a
good
few
item
from
Heinnie
Haynes
and
have
had
nothing
but
satisfying
purchases
from
them.
I'm
sure
if
I
did
a
man
hunt
on
the
web
I
could
find
the
item(s)
I'm
looking
for
at
a
smidgen
cheeper
and
possible
save
one
or
two
quid
but
the
customer
service
is
unbeatable,
they
email
you
exactly
when
they
have
dealt
with
your
order
so
you
feel
that
the
package
has
actually
been
picked
up
by
the
courier
as
they
send
it.
Now
this
might
just
be
me
being
crazy

that

is

A

I'm
surprised
that

However,
nothing

Hi
I
am
using
Hw

since
7
years
for
my

to
the

and
within
Europe.
And
I
was
satisfied
very
much
in
the
beginning.
During
the
last
two
years
I
had
to
realise,
that
many
good
our
even
very
goot
Hostels
and
Homestays
no
longer
work
together
with

The
reasen
I
was
told
is,
that
the
Hw
d
com
margin
is
to
high,
especially
for
bookers
longer
than
3
days.
This
might
be
one
of
the
reasons,
that
Hw
d

lists
more

more

lower

so

Frank
I've
been
happy
with
almost
everything
i've
bought
from
Onnit.
The
food
tastes
great
and
is
super
nutritious,
and
the
supplements
are
excellent.
You
can
tell
Onnit
puts
in
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
into
making
sure
the
products
they
provide
are
top
notch.
It
shows
in
the
product
itself,
and
it
show's
in
the
price!
It
bites
a
little,
but
I
keep
coming
back
for
more!

Very

Recommended

and
lived
up
to
everything
they
told
us.
Supplement
Warehouse
has
the
best
prices
to
buy
supplements.
The
prices
are
already
low
and
then
they
offer
a
5%
price
match
if
you
can
find
a
lower
price
anywhere
else
online.
They
charge
a
reasonable
price
for
shipping
based
on
shipping
weight.
They
also
have
a
plethora
of
free
items
including
a
shaker
cup
and
Muscle
&
Fitness
subscription.
I
have
ordered
from
them
several
times
and
have
received
excellent
customer
service.
The
only
(minor)
compliant
I
ever
have
with
them
is
that
sometimes
they
are
not
offering
or
are
out
of
stock
in
an
item
I
am
seeking
to
purchase.
For
instance
this
time
I
was
trying
to
purchase
Optimum
Nutrition
Glutamine
Powder
but
they
were
not
carrying
it
at
all.
However,
overall
the
experience
is
a
5/5.
I
was
impressed
by
the
speed
of
the
delivery,

I
truly
like
you
guys
,
geeat

keep

Viator's
website
is
easy
to
navigate
and
use,
their
response
was
fast
and
efficient
and
when
I
had
a
question
and
used
their
phone
service
the
person
I
spoke
to
was
friendly
informative
and
patient.
I
searched
for
a
better
price,
but
couldn't
find
one.
When
I
was
looking
for
a
company
to
ship
my
car
from
California
to
Pennsylvania
Montway
came
in
less
then
any
other
company
was
able
to
quote
me.
I
made
the
reservations
two
days
before
the
pickup
and
they
were
able
to
accommodate
my
tight
schedule
without
any
problems.
The
total
time
between
pickups
was
4
days,
which
is
quicker
then
I
ever
expected.
Overall
I
would
use
them
again,
and
recommend
them
to
a
friend.
They
have
the
products
I
want
at
competitive
prices,
good
delivery
charges,
and
fast

I
will
shop
with
them
again.

Why

I
booked
by
telephone
as
there
was
a
problem
booking
via
the
website.
The
process
was
easy
and
the
person
I
spoke
with
was
pleasant
and
helpful.

The
cost
of
the
Meet
&
Greet
service
at
Luton
Airport
was
reasonable
and
on
arrival
and
departure
the

company
was
efficient
and
prompt.

I
would
recommend
this
service
and
would
definitely
use
it
again.
It
was
the
simplest
car
buying
experience
that
I've
ever
had.
I
applied
on-
line,
got
approved.
Came
into
a
drive-time
dealership
in
Riverside,
CA.
It
was
easy,
just
picked
my
car,
test
drive
it,
and
made
the
deal.
Pretty
easy!
I
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
from
partsgeek!

Their
price
beat
everyone
elses,
and
the
items
arrived
in
excellent
condition
and
on
time.
I
was
very
pleased
with
all
aspects
from
Appliance
Online,
after
choosing
our
washer/dryer
it
was
just
ordered
and
delivered
in
two
days,
if
you
required
it
could
be
delivered
next
day.
I
want
to
wait
until
I
get
credit
for
the
wrong
parts
you
shipped
me
and
until
I
see
if
you
provide
the
correct
parts.
Easy
to
use
an
quick
delivery.
I
use
the
site
to
research
products
and
the
YouTube
for
training
and
other
info.

They
usually
have
what
you
want
at
the
best
price,
if
not
they
are
close.

Love
the
sight
and
love
stopping
in
the
store
at
least
once
a
year
or
so.

I
seem
to
stay
in
NYC
at
the
New
Yorker
on
34th
and
8th.

The
staff
is
always
very
knowledgeable
and
helpful
on-line
or
in
person.

I
also
like
that
they
are
right
up
front
with
when
they
will
do
business
and
when
you
will
need
to
wait.
Needed
to
have
a
piano

to
my
new

Great
service,
speedy
delivery,
well
packed.
Will
definitely
use
again.
Cheaper

fast

I
would
certainly
recommend
this
company
to
any
one.
Everything
they
said
would
happen,
happened
and
more.
SUPER
FAST
SHIPPING
GREAT
PRICE
The
shipment
was
fast,
and
the
product
was
great!
I
called
Travelup
to
confirm
my
flight
and
book
the
bags.
Travelup
said
for
me
to
call
AerLingus,
AerLingus
said
for
me
to
call
Travelup.
But
in
the
end
after
10P
of
phone
call
cost
and
1
hour's
worth
of
my
time
and
being
passed
around,
my
flight
is
now
confirmed
and
they
told
me
to
book
the
bags
at
the
airport!!!
WHY
THE
HELL
IS
THIS
SO
HARD!!!???
Bought
new
sets
of
the
large
grape
cluster
lights
to
put
on
the
pergola.
Weather
finally
got
to
the
old
ones
and
OOGA
Lights
always
has
stock
and
quick
delivery.
I
don't
normally
rate
things
because
I
always
assume
that
they
get
lost
in
the
mix
of
everything.
The
one
thing
I
feel
that
is
very
important
and
now
a
requirement
of
any
computer
that's
connected
to
the
internet
is
protection
from
whatever
lurks
beyond
the
wall.

Yeah,
that
was
a
Game
of
Thrones
reference.
I,m
very
happy
with
Petflow
with
the
following
exceptions.
One,
it
was
indicated
somewhere
that
you
would
add
a
product
if
you
didn't
offer
it.
I
requested
that
you
offer
large
size
Dentastix
from
Pedigree.
The
person
I
talked
to
made
it
seem
like
like
it
was
up
to
me
to
check
the
list
to
see
if
was
added.
In
other
words,
lip
service.

The
product
is
still
not
on
the
list.
And
two,
your
system
of
sending
the
orders
out
at
a
specific
interval
leaves
something
to
be
desired.
I
by
phone
had
requested
that
an
order
not
be
shipped
until
I
released
it.
I
then
received
a
e-mail
saying
the
order
was
shipping
in
a
week.
Not
good.
The
problem
appears
to
be
straightened
out
now.
I
have
used
Merlin
on
several
occassions
and
have
always
been
very
pleased
with
the
experience.

T
Easy
to
use
website,
allowed
me
to
find
inexpensive
storage
quickly
and
much
easier
then
if
I
did
it
by
calling
around.
I've
made
15+
orders,
and
only
1
time
did
I
have
to
wait
more
than
7
days
for
a
product.

And
even
then,
it
was
shipped
after
I
received
the
rest
of
my
order
without
any
extra
cost.

Customer
service
is
awesome
and
the
prices
are
the
best
around!
I
thought
the
jumpers
would
have
been
thicker
I
didn't
understand
the
weight
they
quoted
so
I
have
returned
one
but
kept
the
other
as
it
will
go
under
a
jacket.
Its
a
pity
they
couldn't
have
explained
that
they
were
thin
and
only
suitable
for
the
summer.
They
look
good
quality
however.
they
should
write
to
me
again
in
a
few
months
and
then
I
can
tell
them
how
it
is
wearing.
Amazed
by
their
efficiency
and
keeping
in
contact.
Good
price
and
good
service
could
you
ask
for
more!
Excellent
product,
quickly
delivered
at
a
competative
price.

I
have
been
purchasing
from
B&H
for
more
than
30
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
-
even
before
online
ordering
was
available.

I
still
check
the
B&H
website
first
and
only
check
others
for
additional

if
necessary.

Thanks,

reliability,

THUMBS
UP
FOR
ME
Excellent
Transaction.
Everything
was
fine
but
the
whole
experience
was
let
down
as
there
were
no
instructions
in
the
box.
The
video
on
the
website
helps
but
as
I
don't
build
this
racking
daily
it
took
a
bit
of
working
out.
The
first
lot
of
shelves
were
a
bit
of
a
struggle
but
when
I
had
worked
out
what
to
do
the
second
set
were
easy.
With
some
basic
instructions
the
whole
process
would
have
been
simple.
Memory
Suppliers
provided
our
company
with
a
very
quick
and
easy
solution
to
getting
our

thumb
drives.

Provided
our
logo
and
information
and
had
a
quick
return
on
the

Ordering
was
easy
and
product
shipped
on

Good,
but
see
above.
More

I've
been
a
loyal
customer
of
supplementwarehouse
for
many
years
and
have
always
been
pleased
with
service,
shipping,
and
products.
Always
have
everything
I
need
plus
so
much
more
with
free
samples
and
products.
Thanx
guys
i
am
still
waiting
for
the
product.
Its
been
almost
6
months
and
the
sunglasses
are
stuck
in
plenty
of
burocract
stuff.
They
say
the
product
is
waiting
to
check
the
autencity
of
it.
I
couldnt
imagine
that
the
company/produdt
is
suspicious
like
that
to
wait
so
long
to
enjoy
a
simple
sunglasses.
So,
i
dont
recommend
this
store.
I've
ordered
a
couple
times
from
supplement
warehouse
and
have
gone
into
the
store.

Every
time
I
go
there,
I've
always
walked
a
way
happy.
Just
be
sure
to
price
match
for
the
best
possible
deal
on
the
net!
The
web
page
made
it
very
easy
to
find
the
sunglasses
I
was
looking
for,
Maui
Jim's.

The
model
number
info
on
my
old
Maui's
had
long
since
worn
off,
but
by
using

the
web
page
I
could
easily
identify
the
replacement
I
needed.
This
company
stinks!
The
Coolshop
is
very

I
bought
a

decoder
after
checking
all
the
usual
sites
and
found
them
to
be
as
cheap
as
anywhere
around.
With
free
postage
it
was
a
must
to
purchase.
I
received
the
decoder
the
next
working
day.
I
will
certainly
be
checking
out
this
company
again
in
the
future

Just
installed
a
rebuilt
3RZFE
engine
in
a
99
Toyota
Tacoma
for
my
son.
For
those
of
you
that
need
1
they
are
hard
to
find
and
$1600.00
plus
core
charge.
Once
complete
it
would
not
run
properly,
We
started
trouble
shooting
to
find
that
2
of
the
4
injectors
were
badly
corroded.
So
I
ordered
replacements
from
BuyAutoParts.com.
After
installing
the
engine
ran
slightly
better
but
still
on
not
all
4
cylinders.
While
starting
a
noid
test
to
see
if
the
injectors
are
getting
the
proper
fire,
on
the
second
injector
the
engine
made
a
loud
knocking
sound
that
concerned
the
mechanic
I
was
working
with.
We
pulled
the
plugs
out
to
see
that
#3
plug
was
drenched
in
fuel
and
had
not
been
firing.
The
new
injector
had
filled
the
cylinder
with
fuel
causing
hydrolock
(bent
cylinder
rod).
After
contacting
BuyAutoparts.com
about
the
defective
part
they
wanted
to
speak
to
the
mechanic
and
they
would
get
back
to
me
shortly.
My
mechanic
called
them
then
called
me
back,
after
4
hours
waiting
for
Buyauto
to
call
me
then
I
finally
called
them
back.
The
customer
service
person
was
to
send
a
replacement
injector
at
no
charge
but
refuses
to
give
me
any
assistance
in
repairing
the
damaged
caused
by
the
faulty
part.
She
even
stated
that
the
part
is
probably
not
bad
but
I
had
other
issued
causing
the
injector
to
dump
fuel
and
the
same
problem
would
happen
with
the
replacement.
I
took
the
injectors
and
had
them
tested
to
find
that
3
were
operating
properly
spraying
10cc's
of
fuel
yet
the
4th
was
spraying
80cc's
which
filled
the
cylinder
with
fuel
and
caused
this
problem.
I
then
contacted
BuyAutoParts.com
again,
I
sent
them
paperwork
indicating
the
test
results
along
with
a
video
of
the
test,
I
again
asked
about
liability
and
how
they
are
going
to
assist
me
in
the
additional
repairs.
They
stated
that
their
warranty
does
not

cover
labor
replacing
a
defective
part
yet
I
kept
stating
I
was
not
looking
for
labor
on
the
part,
I
needed
parts
and
labor
to
repair
other
issued
caused
by
the
part.
They
sent
me
a
copy
of
the
warranty
and
the
last
line
is
"WE
EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM
LIABILITY
FOR
INCIDENTAL
AND
CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES
CAUSED
BY
THE
AUTO
PART
SOLD".
Here
it
is,
I'm
screwed!
I
with
I
could
expressly
disclaim
liability
in
my
business
and
get
away
with
it.
Them
I
realized
that
this
company
is
a
Google
Trusted
Store
so
I
contacted
Google
for
assistance
with
my
issued.
Google
was
able
to
get
me
a
full
refund
of
the
original
cost
of
my
order
but
they
were
not
able
to
get
BuyAutoParts.com
to
take
responsibility
for
the
problems
they
caused
me.
Now
thanks
to
this
faulty
part
I
have
to
spend
another
$300.00
in
additional
parts
along
with
the
labor
cost
to
repair
a
perfectly
good
engine
that
has
never
ran
before!

I
used

While
I
have
not

figured
out
the

to
putting
up

have

I
do
know
it
would
be
completely
impossible
for

without

I
was

The
scrap
yard
wanted
$35.00
for
the
used
part
.
So
I
bought
the
new
ones
for
the
same
price
.

What
a
know
brainer
I
was
about
to
ship
my
clubs
from
CA
to
CT
via
UPS
ground
which
I
estimated
would
cost
at
least
$95
one-way.

I
was
looking
online
to
find
out
about
pricing
and
came
across
the
ShipSticks
website.

I
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
and
am
very
glad
I
did.

The
whole
process
was
very
easy
to
follow.

I
was
also
surprised
at
the
cost.

It
cost
me
$65
to
ship
them
across
the
country.

They
arrived
before
the
date
they
were
scheduled
to
arrive
without
any
issues.

I
would
definitely
recommend
this
site
and
absolutely
plan
to
use
it
again
the
next
time
I
travel.
Couldn't
ask
for
any
better
service
.
Part
works
great.
My
cudos
to
you.
The
best
thing
to
say
is
that
there
were
absolutely
no
issues
with
the
car
rental
process.
Good
quality
and
speed
delivery
-
great
magnets
and
very
strong
ones
too!
Very
easy
to
find
the
right
product,
simple
ordering,
competitive
pricing
and
very
efficient
delivery.
Communications,
I.e.
Status
updates
were
very
good
too.
My
experience
of
buying
online
is
pretty
extensive.
So
for
a
company
to
stand
out
from
the
rest
they
need
to
be
just
that
little
bit
better
than
the
rest.
What
stood
out
for
me
was
the
rapid
delivery,
the
information
provided
about
the
delivery
and
mostly
the
no
nonsense
attitude
to
dealing
with
a
damaged
part.
They
passed
my
message
straight
over
to
the
wholesaler,
who
contacted
me
to
make
sure
they
knew
exactly
which
part
needed
replacing
and
then
dispatched
it
immediately.
You
can't
ask
for
better
than
that!!
I
like
that
they
have
all
the
parts
ur
looking
for
just
like
an
auto
parts
store
great
prices
also
i
would
buy
from
them
again.

I've
used

several
times,
their
prices
are
great,
no
issues
whatsoever.
The
shopping
experience
was
simple
and
quick.
I'll
reserve
final
evaluation
after
I
receive
the
order.
Good
company,
nice
products,
kinda
slow
shipping,
but
that's
the
only
negative.
The
on-line
hiring
was
fairly
simple
but
it
is
not
until
you
have
made
the
booking
that
you
can
see
what
is
included.
In
my
case,
I
saw
that
the
car
was
supplied
with
a
full
tank
but
it
was
not
until
I
was
at
the
Alamo
desk
that
I
realised
that
the
fuel
needed
paying
for
locally.
This
cost
more
than
the
one
day
hire
I
had
booked.
I
think
a
one
day
hire
should
have
provoked
a
warning
on
fuel
charged
and
I
would
have
then
chosen
a
more
inclusive

the
first
thing
I
noticed
was
that

insisting
that
the

the
printer
refused
to
work!
I
did
some
research
and
soon
learned
that
this
was
normal
with
refilled
cartridges

I
was
eventually
able
to

and

so
I
am

looking

When
I
saw
this
deal,
I
was
way
stoked,
but
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
dealt
with
Chris
Castle
and
Showpiece

I
was
actually
very
cautious
because
the
price
was
SO
good.

Very
pleased
with
all
aspects
of
this
deal,
including
very
fast

Purchased
two

after
checking

They
had
the

and

I
received
them
in

few
days.
Hey.
Guess
what?

I
ordered
from
Shower
Doctor
before
3
o'clock
on
Wednesday
and
by
3
o'clock
the
next
day
the
new
shower
unit
had
been
delivered,
fitted
and
tested.The
Supa
jet
202
is
nearly
a
direct
replacement
for
the
Showerforce
2000.
All
I
had
to
do
was
turn
my
pipe
connections
through
90
degrees
anticlockwise

to
accommodate
back
and
bottom
entry.
If
the
202
cover
was
approximately
2"
longer
then
I
wouild
not
have
had
to
cut
the
old
entry
pipeworkfrom
the
showerforce
to
fit
into
the
202
entry
points.
Running
and
installing
the
new
transformer
and
cable
was
also
quite
simple,
using
the
old
low
voltage
cable
as
a
draw
wire
to
feed
the
new
cable
from
the
shower
through
the
plasterboard
and
into
the
fused
switch
supply.
As
i
have
still
not

The

their

I'll
be

next

nothing
wrong
with
the

but
I
am
trying
to

up.
the
second

was

I
got
what
I
expected
with
both
product
and
the
quality
is
great.
I
put

I
am

Finally
the

the

Hi
It
is
very
nice
to
have
access
to
Asian
fashion
and
other
geeky
gadgets,
but
it
is
a
pity
that
the
shipping
&
return
is
so
expensive.
They
don't
give
you
refund
either,
so
you
end
up
buying
stuff
that
you
adore
but
don't
need
anyway.
Our
DriveAway
experience
was
extremely
positive.
The
booking
arrangements
were
straightforward,
the
collection
service
on
arrival
was
fast
and
efficient
and
the
same
can
be
said
with
the
return
of
the
vehicle.
The
car
itself
performed
well
and
met
our
expectations.
I
would
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
DriveAway
to
friends
in
Australia.
Too
bad
I
had
not
noticed
that
the
"Hertz"

Only
noticed
it
after
departing
the
dark
underground
garage
and
at
my
hotel
while
loading
for
the
trip
to
south
France.

the
freight
increased
accordingly

which
is
understandable.

When
I
received
the
order
there
was
1
less
hood
strut,
but
I
was
charged
the
freight
amount
for
2.
I
still
need
1
more
hood
strut.
We
ordered
your
coffee
on
a
Sunday
night.

It
arrived
the
following
Wednesday
morning.

Wow!

What
service!

We
have
been
enjoying
several
of
the
selections
and
we
can
honestly
say
"They
have
all
been
great!"
No
taxes
and
no
shipping,
always
much
faster
than
expected.

This
is
by
far
my
favorite
online
store.

I
have
NEVER
had
a
problem
with
them.

I
have
always
been
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
fast
I
get
my
stuff.

I
don't
even
have
an
account
with
them.

I
just
use
my
Google
wallet.

This
means
I
don't
have
to
have
another
online
account
with
them
and
remember
yet
another
password.

They
have
multiple
payment
options,
so
it's
whatever
you
prefer
(which
all
retailers
should
do!).

When
I
need
to
buy
something
online,
I
check
here
first.

Not
only
do
they
usually
have
the
lowest
prices....
then
most
of
the
merchandise
has
no
taxes
and
no
shipping.

When
you
factor
that
in,
I
can
rarely
find
a
better
deal
...
anywhere.

Then
add
in
the
best
service,
and
it's
a
no
brainer.

I
simply
cannot
say
this
about
any
other
online
vendor
I
have
used.

..
also
don't
think
they
only
sell
cameras...
you
would
be
surprised.

They
sell
almost
every
variety
of
electronics
and
then
some.
You
guys
rock!

We
rented
a

in
Bari,

and
returned
it
at

Check-in
and
drop-offs
at
both
airports
went
quickly
and
smoothly.

Staff
at
both
places
spoke
English
well,
so
communication
was
not
an
issue.

The
vehicle
(a

was
reliable
and
ran
well--no

At
pick-up,
the
vehicle
had
a
few
minor
dints
and
scratches
that
we
had
to
document
with
the
staff.

Only
negative
was
that

were
empty.

I'd
go

First,
I'd
like
to
say
that
it
was
nice
to
find
a
company
that
didn't
have
a
problem
delivering
to
Northern
Ireland
as
many
seem
to,
despite
it
being
part
of
the
UK.
I
placed
my
order
online
on
the
Thursday
evening
and
was
delighted
to
receive
my
new
dining
room
chairs
within
a
week.
The
communication
from
made.com
was
exemplary
and
the
delivery
company
also.
The
chairs
were
exactly
what
I
was
after,
very
easy
to
assemble
and
have
transformed
our
dining
area,
to
the
extent
that
one
visitor
asked
if
we
had
a
new
table
(we
don't).
I
would
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
made.com
and
will
be
the
first
site
I
go
to
when
I
need
my
next
piece
of
furniture.
Well
done
and
thanks!
I
found
TWE
through
google
and
found
the
site
very
easy
to
navigate
and
the
prices
as
keen
as
any
other
whisky
site.
On
ordering
I
received
a
confirmation
email
and
then
subsequent
tracking
emails
to
confirm
despatch
etc.
The
Whisky
arrived
within
5
days
and
my
brother
was
delighted
with
it.
Only
two
small
niggles
I
had
were
that
the
tracking
email
didn't
link
into
anything
other
than
the
delivery
informationpage
on
the
website,
but
as
the
delivery
was
on
time
this
wasn't
a
problem.
The
other
was
that
I
paid
the
extra
for
a
card
to
go
with
the
bottle
as
it
was
a
gift
but
this
didn't
arrive
with
it,
though
apparently
will
follow
later
which
is
a
bit
pointless
as
this
was
a
thankyou
gift.
The
tech
(Pete)
was
great.....He
went
over
the
system
and
answered
any
questions
we
had.

He
was
very
pleasant
and
fun
to
talk
with.

I
recommend
Smith
Monitoring
to
anyone....The
service
and
price
is
great.....The
service
I
signed
up
for
was
more
than
what
I
needed,
the
tech
recommended
what
I
needed
and
it
was
actually
cheaper.

Thanks
again
for
the
great
service

Hello
friend,
This
website
is
on
another
level
of
greatness.
I
am
recommending
the
shit
out
of
it
for
you
After
going
to
stores
like
Napa,
Auto
Zone,
O'Riley's,
etc...
and
walking
away
feeling
like
i
just
got
punched
in
the
gut
because
of
their
mark
up
on
parts,
i
found
partsgeek.com.
I
found
the
parts
i
needed
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
the
auto
parts
stores
locally.
I'll
shop
partsgeek.com
again
with
out
any
reservations.
Item
exactly
as
ordered
and
delivered

a
couple
of
weeks

a

part
that
was
difficult
to
find.
Great
service.
Thanks.
I
booked
a
flight
to
Paris
and
everything
was
super
smooth.
Got
my
tickets

and
was

I
had
some
questions
regarding
the
trip
which
were
answered
by
customer
service

very
quickly
I
will
buy
parts
from
this
company
again
in
the
future
,very
near
future
!!!

I
have
been
with
Identity
Guard
for
several
months.

I
always
look
for
problems
and
then
offer
ways
to
improve
things
using
my
view
of
the
world.

I
have
no
suggestions
for
Identity
Guard.
I
am
currently
fighting
with
the
USPS
regarding
the
delivery
of
my
glasses.

The
USPS
website
show
the
package
as
delivered
but
I
never
received.

A
suggestion
to
help
solve
this
problem
is
to
require
a
signature
at
delivery.

This
will
ensure
the
person
actually
receives
packages.
All
in
all
great.
Only
complaint
is
i
ordered
a
radiator
core
that
holds
the
front
clip/radiator,
not
a
terribly
large
piece
right?
They
sent
it
to
me
in
a
box
i
could
park
my
truck
in,
is
this
why
it
costed
almost
as
much
as
the
part
for
shipping?
Owell
looks
good

I
like
the

and
the
service
(although

is
trust
worthy.
What
I
don't
like
is
that
there
is
a
fee
for
activating
a
Xbox
or
PS
card,
usually
$2.5
and
it's
unacceptable
given
several
sites
sell
you
online
codes
at
their
retail
price.
For
example,
[External

]sells
$20
PSN
cards
at
$20.
I
don't
just
don't
get
why
I
have
to
pay
more
money
for
less.
I
don't
have
special
company
loyalty
to
GAK,
but
they
showed
up
as
the
cheapest
for
all
the
items
I
was
buying
on

shopping,
and
with

they
were
everything
I'd
like
to
expect
from

Dealing

I

Every

I
love

They
take
my

a

Can
we
have

Got
my

got

I
ordered

Before
Ordering
i
called
Toolstop
to
pose
a
few
product

questions.
How
NICE
to
find
an
online
seller
who
actually
"Knows
the
Technicalities
the
Products
they
are
selling"
!!
Having
spent
a
lot
of
time
looking
for
a
diamond
for
an
engagement
ring
I
found
Quality
Diamonds
on
the
web.

Prices
were
a
lot
less
expensive
than
elsewhere,
enough
so
that
I
could
get
a
better
stone,
brilliant.

Messaged,
mailed
and
talked
to
customer
service
agents
who
were
incredibly
helpful
and
couldn't
do
enough
to
get
my
ideal
diamond.

Delivery
was
lightning
fast
and
free,
it
arrived
the
day
after
I
ordered
it.

I
won't
be
buying
another
engagement
ring
but
I
know
where
I'll
be
shopping
for
the
diamonds
for
an
eternity
ring.
Merlin
have
never
missed
a
beat
in
any
of
my
orders,
large
or
small.
Some
of
the
best
prices
around
and
quick
to
post;
they
are
really
the
first
place
I
come
to
when
looking
for
my
bike
bits.
The
website
tells
you
the
manufacturer
of
any
given
part
&
gives
you
options
for
different
ones
(and)
if
they
are
available.
On
the
same
page,
suggestions
for
what
else
you
might
need
for
your
project.
Really
good
service;
they
provided
plenty
of
communication
on
how
the
order
was
progressing
and
when
I'd
get
it;
it
arrived
quickly
and
well
wrapped,
and
was
just
what
I'd
ordered.
The
pencils
were
delivered
on
Monday
after
being
ordered
on
Friday,
which
was
great.

The
packaging
was
good,
and
the
pencils
arrived
in
good
condition.

I
was
very
pleased
with
the
speed
and
quality
of
the
service.
The
selection
of
items
and
the
speed
with
which
they
delivered
was
matched
by
very
reasonable
prices,
all
in
all
first
class.
I
ordered
a
small
office
shredder
which
arrived
promptly.
Unfortunately
it
didn't
seem
to
be
getting
power,
I
phoned
the
warehouse
and
tried
the
various
fixes
they
suggested
to
no
avail.
Without
further
prompting
they
immediately
dispatched
a
new
shredder
which
arrived
a
day
later
and
works
perfectly.
I
was
very
impressed
at
their
willingness
to
make
sure
I
had
a
satisfactory
product
so
quickly.
i
recommend
them
highly.
It
took
a
while
to
realize
I
was
not
talking
to
the
exact
Hampton
Inn
where
I
wanted
a
reservation.
Otherwise,
no
complaints.
Ordered
4pm
and
order
arrived
in
post
next
day.
What
more
could
you
ask
for??
The
service
was
fast
and
as
advertised.
Shipping
was
prompt
and
they
had
lots
of
stuff
to
choose
from.
Customers
like
their
swag
and
I've
gotten
some
good
publicity
for
my
web
site.
I'm
taking
one
star
off
because
AFTER
I
had
already
placed
my
order
they
sent
me
an
offer
for
free
shipping
and
$50
off,but
only
on
my
first
order
which
was,
obviously,
impossible
to
use
since
I
had
already
ordered.
The
web
site
was
easy
to
use
and
offered
great
information
regarding
the
hotels
and
pricing.
B&H
Photovideo
is
a
great
and
reliable
resource
for
all
things
photographic.

I
have
shopped
online
and
at
the
Super
Store
for
many
years.
You
had
better
get
in
contact
with
if
you
want
the
best
service
and
quality
So...
yeah,
B&H
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
photography
merchandise
businesses
around.

Always
has
what
I
need
and
the
items
I
order
come
in
such
a
short
time.

Thanks.

When

the

didn't
get

When
I

added
the

Unfortunatelly
only
one

When
I

again
they
sent
the
missing

directly.
Website
is
to
navigate.
Parts
are
of
good
quality
and
the
prices
are
unbeatable.
The
parts
came
to
my
house
almost
to
the
day
of
what
they
said
the
delivery
date
would
be.
The
shipping
cost
was
low
and
for
some
of
my
purchases.
We
have
used
Printerinks
on
a
couple
of
occasions
now
and
they
have
always
delivered
very
promptly,
particularly
as
we
live
in
Spain.
The
last
order
coincided
with
a
holiday
over
here
in
Spain
and
a
weekend
and
we
still
got
the
package
in
3
days.
Excellent!
Many
thanks.
Very
pleased
with
the
speed
of
delivery
and
when
a
part
was
missing
it
was
dispatched
immediately.
I
purchased
3
books
from

Some

I
purchased
cost
cheaper
than
what
other

offer
for
renting
them.
The
delivery

from

was
a
great
tool
to
track
my

Some
of
the
negative

I
tried
to

It

I

Very

I
was

DAVID
SHUTTLE
WAS
AN
EXCELLENT
ONLINE
STORE
TO
ORDER
FROM
.
Ordered
product
and
literally
15
mins
later
wanted
to
cancel.
Tried
to
call
but
was
sent
to
a
telecomputer
and
unable
to
withdraw
order.
Could
have
saved
myself
and
partsgeek
some
money
if
they
would
have
just
allowed
me
to
cancel
by
phone
but
instead
with
all
the
service
request
orders
i
had
to
email
etc

they
got
back
to
me
after
it
shipped.
Probably
bc
they
make
a
little
money
on
handling
charge.
Anyway,
very
inefficient
and
not
impressed.
This
is
a
great
place
to
buy
parts
and
they
fit
just
fine.
These
parts
were
a
perfect
fit
and
makes
the
car
look
good.
Great
service,
quick
and
easy,
however,
a
little
expensive
source
of
funds
for
me
PartsGeek
has
great
pricing
on
parts
that
would
normally
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg.
Also
I
needed
my
part
before
my
off
days,
so
i
could
work
on
my
car.
I
payed
for
two
day
air,
thinking
i
would
get
it
in
two
days.
At
noon
the
following
day
it
was
at

door.
A
very
welcomed
surprise.

printer.B&H
had
all
the

I
was
looking
for

and
the

helped
me
decide
which
one
to
get.


B&H
had
the
best
price
and
expedited
shipment
for
free.
Better
than
Amazon.
Items
were
exactly
as
described
and
were
delivered
faster
than
requested.

I
have
placed
two
orders
for
hard
to
find
volvo
parts.

The
first
order
arrived
next
day
even
though
I
paid
for
two
day
shipping.

The
second
order
arrived
in
two
days.

One
Email
when
the
order
was
placed,
one
when
the
item
shipped
with
the
tracking
number.

I
did
not
have
to
return
anything
so
further
contact
was
not
necessary.
First
time
that
I
have
ordered
from
this
company,
but
they
had
a
good
range
of
products,
so
I
thought
I
would
give
them
a
try...
They
were
very
easy
to
deal
with,
providing
excellent
communications
on
the
transaction
and
delivery
(allocating
a
1
hour
timeslot
on
the
day).
The
extra
large
chair
bean
bag
I
ordered
looks
good,
is
of
good

and
is
very
very
comfy

If
ever
I
need
anything
like
this
again,
they
will
be
my
first
port
of
call...
Great
service,
with
very
useful
option
to
re-schedule
a

to
a
more
convenient
day.

Ik
heb
onlangs
vier
jack

Allereerst
kon
ik

vinden

goedkoper
was
en
bovendien
viel
het
aanbod
elders
vies
tegen
met
meestal
6m
als

(tenzij
je
ineens
vier
keer
zoveel
wilde

De

zijn

en
ook

Dus
geen

Waiting
to
see
about
delivery...
This
was
a
purchase
from
a
company
which
clearly
cares
very
much
about
their
customers.Goods
are
priced
fairly,delivery
was
arranged
with
attention
to
detail
,prompt
and
efficient
.Customer
satisfaction
is


obviously
a
priority.You
are
left
with
the
confident
knowledge
that
you
have
been
dealing
with
a
quality
organisation.
First
time
I've
bought

Beautiful

look
at,
beautiful

I
found
ordering
process
simple
and
straightforward
and
the
online
consultation
was
thorough
yet
simple
and
a
quick
response
given.would
recommend
this
service
for
people
who
have
little
time
on
their
hands
and
who
know
what
they
require.
Ordered
and
paid
for

hassle
free
and
convenient

Only
improvement
I
would
recommend
is
that
you
cannot
print
the
size
options
&
pricing
screens,
it
does
not
format
correctly
for
print
and
just
garbles
itself.

they
get
it
done,
and
right,
and

and

the

Roller

of
3
young
tech
savvy
daughters.
With
all
of
them
away
at
College
(2
and
Michigan
State
and
one
at
Cal)

my
life
on
the
computer
has
been
much
more
challenging...
However,
when
the
challenge
of
finding
a
place
to
stay
at
my
daughters
parents
weekend
at
Cal
was
staring
at
me
with
its
cold
dead
eyes...
I
wrestled
the
technology
demon
into
submission
and
used
tripping.com
to
find
a
great
place
in
near
by
San
Francisco...
It
was
also
our
25th
wedding
anniversary
so
I
wanted
to
make
it
extra
special.
The
site
was
very
user
friendly
and
I
didn't
need
to
call
upon
the
help
of
my
daughters
once
which
means
that
we
have
a
winner
here!
If
I
could
use
it,
and
believe
me...
I
have
trouble
with
anything
from
iphones
to
turning
on
the
TV
these
days...
then
anyone
can
use
it!
Well
done!

Great

What
can
I
say
except
exceptional!
I
had
a
small
problem
with
my
order
which
in
no
way
was
Heinnie's
fault
and
they
dealt
with
very
professionally.
All
my
emails
were
answered
within
hours
(even
the
pestering
ones!)
and
the
problem
was
sorted
immediately.

This
is
a
company
I
will
trust
in
the
future
with
further
orders
as
I
know
I
will
get
great
advice,
exceptional
service
and
made
to
feel
like
a
valued
customer.

Keep
up
the
great
work,
it's
good
to
find
a
company
where
the
needs
of
the
customer
come
first!
Rock
Auto

...
my
mistake
I
wasted
hours
of
my
time
looking
for
a
lower
price
online
after
seeing
easytobooks
low
price
.
I
won't
next
time
.
Easytobook
saved
me
close
to
ten
dollars
a
night
over

its
closest
competitor
!
Finding
a
storage
space
for
my
car
couldn't
have
been
easier.
I
found
all
the
information
I
needed
accurately
displayed
and
easily
accessible.
I
would
definitely
recommend
this
site.
First,
$50
each
way
to
get
my
clubs
to
my
mom's
in
Florida.
That's
awesome.
Then
-
they
will
pick
them
up
from
wherever
I
want.
I
took
them
to
work
-
didn't
have
to
deal
with
waiting
at
home
for
UPS.
But
here's
where
it
gets
good
-
I
had
to
cancel
the
return
shipment.
Wanted
to
leave
them
in
Florida
for
the
winter
(I
live
in
Minnesota).
I
called
the
customer
service
line
late
at
night
(figured
I'd
hear
a
recording
of
hours
of
operation).
Someone
answered.
I
swear
I
heard
a
TV
in
the
background,
so
I
think
the
call
was
forwarded
to
this
person's
home.
30
seconds
later,
I
had
a
canceled
order
and
a
coupon
code
in
my
inbox.
I
used
it
last
week
-
delivery
without
a
hitch.
For
$50.
Five
stars.
PartsGeek
had
what
i
wanted
and
delivered
it
fast!
They
have
all
the
products
I
need
at
the
lowest
rates
guaranteed.
I've
never
had
a
problem
with
either
shipping
or
picking
things
up
at
the
store
itself.
I
am
so
impressed,
I
will
be
ordering
two
more
as
Christmas
presents;
if
you
hold
the
price.
Simple
and
easy
to
order
via
the
web
site.
Found
me
the
best
price
available.
Various
options
to
choose
from
regarding
delivery
dates
times
etc.
Well
informed
via
text
when
delivery
was
due
and
when
delivery
had
taken
place.
Even
had
the
delivery
driver
ring
to
confirm
he
was
due.
Overall
made
life
very
simple.
Will
certainly
use
this
service
again
and
am
considering
the
direct
debit
scheme
to
spread
the
cost
of
bills.
As
always
Comms
Express
are
a
pleasure
to
do
business
with
from
the
ease
of
using
the
website
to
the
delivery
notifications
they
send
you,
always
spot
on
and
ultra
reliable.
I
discovered
B&H
few
years
ago,
while
traveling
around
the
world,
and
haven't
found
anything
this
good
anywhere
else.
I
systematically
recommend
it
to
anyone
even
hesitantly
interested
in
photography
because
not
only
it
has
the
best
assortment
of
products
at
the
most
competitive
prices,
but
its
staff
is
passionate
in
helping
you
find
what
exactly
you
need
and
is
fit
for
you.
They
won't
try
to
sell
you
the
more
expensive
last
model
if
that's
not
what
suits
you:
they
are
real
professionals
and
give
good
advice.
Working
hours
are
a
bit
weird
and
can
be
annoying
when
you're
traveling
through
town
only
for
a
couple
of
days,
but
other
than
that
I
can't

think
of
a
single
complaint
I
have
about
B&H.
Shipping
was
done
very
fast.
Only
1day
after
I
place
my
order,
I
got
a
call
straight
away
asking
my
details
to
confirm
delivery.
First
of
all
upon
arriving
at
storage
facility,
we
were
greeted
by
a
very
friendly
and
professional
person,
behind
counter.He
then,
took
us
to
the
unit
avaiable
to
rent,
which
was
very
close
and
clean.
We
returned
back
to
the
office,
where
he
explained
everthying
in
detail
on
cost
of
unit,
thru
out
doing
all
the
paper
work.
After
hearing
of
the
website
on
shaving
forums,
I
was
really
pleased
to
see
all
of
the
selections
on
the
website.

I
could
easily
find
all
of
the
products
that
I
was
looking
for
(including
some
cool
stuff
I
hadn't
seen
anywhere
else),
and
my
order
was
shipped
out
fast.

Everything
was
packaged
well
and
it
got
to
me
pretty
fast.

So
far
I
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
Westcoastshaving.
Next
day
delivery
took
4
days.
I
booked
a
flight
from
Malta
to
Amsterdam
which
on
the
Airmalta
website
would
have
cost
around
340
euro,
booking
through
ebookers
I
got
the
flights
for
222
euro.
I
was
so
shocked
about
the
discrepancy
that
I
called
Airmalta
to
confirm
that
the
flight
went
through,
and
it
was.
Really
chuffed.
I
bought
two
pairs
of
glasses,
and
placed
the
order
on
September
8th.
I
was
immediately
sent
an
email
asking
me
to
confirm
my
prescription
which
I
did
immediately,
however
a
response
was
not
forthcoming
after
having
sent
two
emails
over
the
space
of
a
week.
The
call
centre
was
never
available
and
I
began
to
suspect
a
scam.
I
eventually
got
through
to
a
CSR
who
assured
me
that
the
prescription
was
correct,
the
order
was
filled
and
the
glasses
were
dispatched
shortly
after.
The
product
I
wanted
was
dispatched
quickly,
the
quoted
delivery
time
was
5-7
days
yet
it
was
ordered
on
friday
and
arrived
on
monday.
I
will
use
showerdoc
for
all
my
future
bathroom
needs.
Ho

Ma

rispondono
che

I
have
never
used
a
delivery
service
like
thios
before.previously
I
have
simply
used
parcel
force
and
dropped
my
package
off
at
the
post
office.
I
simply
entered
my
detail;s
and
the
package
size
and
weight
etc
onto
the
webpage
and
the
van
turned
up
the
very
next
day
and
took
my
package.
It
couldn't
be
simpler.
I
then
received
an
email
when
my
package
had
been
delivered.
I
will
definately
use
this
company
again.
Order
a
pair
of
Oakleys
which
was
£100
down
to
£50.
With
a
£10
voucher
code
I
paid
£40
plus
p&p.
Absolute
bargain.
Fast
delivery
&
great
sunglasses.
Would
happily
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
Fantastic
service
from
start
to
finish.
Excellent
selection
of
products
to
chose
from
&
most
importantly
great
prices.
For
example
I
ordered
a
2
large
tubs
of
USN
Muscle
fuel
anabolic
which
normaly
costs
around
£65
to
£60.
I
paid
£43.19
each
which
included
a
10%
discount
offer.
Over
all
have
used
this
site
many
times
for
the
great
service
it
offers.
They
also
use
next
day
delivery
DPD
courier
service
who
tex
you
on

of
delivery
with
an

time
slot.
Keep
up
the
good
work.
The
product
was
meant
to
be
delivered
on
timed
delivery
between
7am-12noon
on
the
monday
it
was
10
minutes
late.
The
delivery
driver
told
me
he
had
not
been
told
to
delivery
it
by
12noon
despite
it
telling
him
on
the
box.
Littlewoods
refunded
the
delivery
charge
of
£4.95
but
i
will
not
order
anything
on
timed
delivery
again.
The
sound
quality
of
the
speakers
is
the
standard
you
would
expect
from
ones
costing
double
even
triple
the
price.
I
would
buy
from
3000rpm
again.
It's
a
great
value,
much
better

I
have
used
Select

previously,
but
with
my
new

my
Optician
recommended
Varifocals.
Never
having
worn
them
before,
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
buying
on
line,
so
I
tried
the
cheaper

After
using
the
other

a
few
times
I
found

Very

The

With

Can't

Excellent

fine.
My
shopping
experience
was
very
good.
We
have
dealt
with
Nada
at
Flight
Network
for
a
number
of
years
now
and
have
had
nothing
but
praise
for
her
assistance
in
getting
our
vacation
plans
finalized.
She
has
been
very
helpful
in
booking
our
cruises
and
all
our
connections.
She
has
gone
out
of
her
way
to
make
our
vacations
run
as
smoothly
as
possible.
I
ordered
from
other
companies
on
the
internet,
which
was
very
expensive
until
I
came
upon
HealthyKin.com
.
The
delivery
came
before
the
expected
time
and
the
prices
was
so
much
LEST
expensive.
The
part
came
on
time
and
in
perfect
condition,
better
part
than
I
thought
it
would
be
.
They
answered
my
questions
promptly
and
tracking
was
great
I
will
buy
again
from
this
co.
Outstanding
professionalism,

Thanks

I

(over
$1,000)
but
after

around
fond
their

in-line
with
other
companies.
Rev.com

very
professional
and

the

short

I
would

Great

I
have

never

even
put

and
amended

surprisingly
easy

and
you
will
not

ShopTo
truely
stands
out
amongst
online
retailers.
Their
products
are
greatly
priced
and
you'd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
cheaper
elsewhere.
They
offer
great
bonus
content
with
games
and
also
reward
loyal
customers.
Their
sending
and
delivery
times
are
great
and
I've
never
once
been
disappointed
as
I've
always
received
my
products
in
time.
They
have
a
great
customer
service
team
always
keen
to
help
out
if
you
have
any
queries.
In
all
the

be
anyone's
first

Website
was
easy
to
use
an
navigate,
selection
wide,
and
prices
hard
to
argue
with.
I
have
purchased
many
times
from
is
supplier
he
products
have
always
met
my
expecations
and
I
still
canno
find
another
company
to
match
their
prices.
Once
I
started
using
Supplement
Warehouse
I
was
very
satisfied.

I
even
told
my
buddies
about
all
the
great
supplements
and
items
they
have
on
SupplementWarehouse.com.

The
variety
and
usefulness
of
every
product
on
the
entire
site
is
astonishing.

I
honestly
need
more
time
just
to
look
through
the
entire
site
and
view
every
product
because
there
are
so
many
options.

I
previously
used
bodybuilder.com
but
I
compared
prices
and
specials
and
it
was
a
no
brainer.

Supplement
Warehouse
was
the
outright
winner
from
my
non
bias
point
of
view.

I
will
continue
to
seek
more
products
from
SupplementWarehouse.com
in
the
future.
I
was
very
pleased
with
my
transaction.
From
ordering
to
delivery
everything
was
perfect!
It
is
awesome
to
order
something
online
and
get
it
fast
and
its
the
right
product.
You
took
care
of
an
error
in

a
way
that
impressed
all

you.

However,
customer

response
to
their

was
they
don't

That
it
the
only
thing
that
let
down
my
experience,
why
advertise
something
that
you
don't
actually
offer.
This
site
is
really
easy
to
use.
Prices
and
tyre
types
and
manufacturers
clearly
laid
out.
You
can
choose
where
you

Very
easy
process.
Wasn't
the
cheapest
price
(by
£2.00
per
tyre)
that
I
could
find,
but
the
ordering
process
together
with
seamless
delivery
process
to
fitting

determined
my
purchase
decision.
Bought
a
pair
of

only
were
they
significantly
cheaper
than
other
retailers
they
also
arrived
within
5
days.

was
also
able
to
be
fully
tracked.
The
website
has
a
wide
range
of
outfits
available
and
it's
easy
to
use.
The
great
thing
for
us
was
that
they
offered

our

arrived
by

the
morning.
I
have
used
ActivInstinct
on
many

I
have
never
found
the
site

either

sizes
available,

Top

When
I
was
trying
to
find
a
storage
unit
(which
is
harder
than
you
might
think)
sparefoot
told
me
about
a
10x10
available.
Since
there
was
only
one
size
and
it
was
too
big,
I
looked
elsewhere
to
no
avail.

By
the
time
I
had
set
up
the
unit
on
the
site,
it
was
too
late
to
call
the
provider
so
I
waited
till
the
next
morning
thinking
I
had
gotten
the
only
available
unit
in
Greeley.

However,
the
provider
said
there
was
no
such
thing.

However,
I
got
lucky
when
he
did
a
search
and
found
a
5x10
no
one
was
using
which
was
just
the
size
I
needed.

Spare
foot
led
me
to
the
place,
but
potentially
could've
wasted
time
if
I
wasn't
stupidly
lucky.
ordering
was
simple,
I
received

with

Although
I
parked
in
the
wrong
place
-
'Valet
Parking'
-
I
was
still
greeted
by
the
StressFree
driver
and
the
handover
was
quick
&
painless.

On
return
the
car
&
driver
were
waiting
for
me
at
the
rendezvous
point.
B&H
just
does
it
right!
They
have
stock,
their
website
is
easy,
and
the
stuff
gets
here
immediately.
Their
prices
are
also
competitive
and
often
lower.

Well

Parts

were
different
then
parts
shown
in

at
time
of
ordering,
parts
also
did
not
fit
and
had
to
be

I
didn't
have

I
wouldn't

anything

I
like

The

security,
and

all
plusses.

I
just
think
$80
dollars

is
a
bit
much
for
the

We
have
been
ordering
from

Ordered
part
on
Thursday
evening.
Due
to
Jubilee
celebrations
was
told
to
expect
delivery
on
the
Wednesday.
Plesently
surprised
when
the
part
arrived
Saturday
morning.
All
worked
well,
very
easy
very
fast.
can't
wait
til
they
add
more
currencies.
Slow
customer
service,
unhelpful,
rude,
and
immature
operators.
Not
able
to
help
a
lick.
Would
not
recommend
to
anyone
else.
Great
bargain
would
definately
purchase
again
.
Both
Steve,
my
sales
person,
&
Bruce,
service
manager,
were
very
professional
&
eager
to
satisfy
my
needs.

I
purchased
four
new
tires
&
alignment.
Arrived
next
day
and
brighter
than
I
expected
from
solar
Always
a
easy,
pleasant
company
to
deal
with
that
expedites
the
goods
FAST
!
I
got
into
Onnit
because
of
the
Rogan
podcast
and
him
boasting
about
Alpha
Brain.

I
have
tried
the
stuff
and
love
it.

I
have
also
tried
Hemp
force,
delicious.

After
trying
these
two,
I
decided
to
give
the
Shroom
Tech
sport
a
try.

I
used
to
be
in
the
military,
and
I
would
take
them
before
I
went
on
my
morning
runs
or
my
gym
sessions
and
felt
like
everything
was
just...
easier
cardiovascular
wise.

Amazing
stuff.

By
far
though,
my
favorite
product
that
Onnit
offers
is
New
Mood.

This
stuff
is
amazing.

I
take
it
before
bed
at
night
and
literally
wake
up
in
a
new
mood.

Best
sleep
I
have
ever
had.

I
feel
great
all
day
too,
focused,
energized
and
ready
to
do
"the
big
work"!


Thanks
Rogan!

Thanks
Onnit!

Keep
making
amazing
products!
I
bought
my
jacket
with
the
frigid
chicago
weather
in
mind.
I
received
a
few
conpliments
the
FIRST
day
I
wore
it.

It
was
delivered
really
quickly
and
handled
with
care.
On
my
first
day
wearing
it,
it
faced
weather
in
10°F,
snow,
and
wind.
It
passed
with
flying
colors.
What
more
can
I
say?
"Write
as
if
you're
speaking
to
a
friend."
ordered
a
part
and
was
under
my
dash
removing
broken
part
and
a
guy
walked
up
and
handed
me
the
new
part
2
days
after
i
ordered
it!!
FREAKY
FAST!
Finally
GREAT
service!
the
only
bad
thing!
they
could've
sent
a
tech
to
install
it
lol!
I
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
company
in
that
they
seemingly
have
all
the
bases
covered
regardless
of
the
type
and
year
of
the
car!
I
need
a
part
and
poof,
they
got
the
part
and
the
one
time
they
sent
me
the
wrong
part,
they
bit
the
bullet
and
resent
the
correct
part
without
any
hassle.
I
am
glad
I
found
them,
I
just
wish
I
could
go
to
the
warehouse
and
pick
up
my
own
parts,
I
live
in
NJ
The
website
is
user-friendly,
the
service
irreproachable,
and
the
freebie
a
nice,
useful
surprise.
Good
choice
of
coffee
brands,
fast
shipping,
a
reasonable
price
-
I
like
the
Coffee
Club!!
Excellent
service!
I'd
thoroughly
recommend
using
this
company.
Great
web
site,
easy
ordering
process,
tracking
all
the
way
to
the
door.
Excellent
service.
I
have
a
well
known
rival
of
GAK

almost
on
my
doorstep
but
their
web
site
was
misleading,
they
didn't
have
the
goods
I
wanted
in
stock
and
the
customer
service
was
poor.
So....next
time
it
will
be
GAK
again.
The
order
was
handled
very
quickly,
two
days
after
ordering
the
shipment
arrived.
The
packaging
was
perfect
and
everything
was
in
perfect
order.
A
friend
of
mine
had
provided
me
with
a
link
to
Cult
Pens
since
I
needed
some
new
supplies
to
doodle,
draw
and
"paint"
with.
I
do
believe
it
was
the
best
link
I
was
ever
forwarded,
as
there
is
quite
a
vast
array
of
pens,
inks
and
writing
material
to
choose
from,
and
for
different
projects.
Quite
like
the
site
and
how
one
can
exploit
the
search
facilities
to
refine
the
results.
The
transactions
are
always
smooth,
and
the
service
is
very
friendly
and
professional.
I
was
looking
for
Barbour
wax
and
found
that
using
auction
sites
was

more
expensive
and
delivery
time
was
longer
than
using
County
Attire
Limited.
It
was
obvious
that
these
were
the
best
people
to
go
with...and
they
were!
They
kept
me
informed
all
the
way
and
delivery
was
spot
on.
Brilliant!
I
would
thoroughly
recommend
their
services
to
anyone.
No
problems

with
compatibility...good
quality,
far
better
than
what
l
have
been
using.
Will
use
you
again!!
Great
curtains
and
wonderful
service
I
had
been
waiting
for
7
weeks
for
a
fridge/freezer
from
a
well
known
local
retailer,
I
cancelled
the
order,
went
on-line
to
AO.com.
Ordered
the
fridge/freezer
monday
3;00pm
received
the
fridge/freezer
thursday

That's
what
I
call
excellent
service,
by
the
way
I
live
in
Northern
Ireland,
Yeah,
very
quick
delivery.
plus
I
received
phone
calls
every
step
of
the
way
telling
date
and
times
of
delivery.
Thoughout
this
purchase
AO.com
have
been
faultless
and
i'm
still
singing
their
praises.
Extremely
rewarding
experience
in
collecting
and
delivering
personal
items.
Order
was
completed
and
shipped
super
fast.
Everything
I
received
was
exactly
what
I
ordered.
I
will
buy
from
Bolt
Depot
only
for
all
my
further
fastner
needs.
DriveAway
Holidays
were
brilliant,
they
helped
us
promptly
all
the
way
and
we
picked
up
our
brand
new
Peugeot
in
France
which
allowed
us
so
much
freedom
with
no
concerns
about
the
car
itself
or
insurance.
At
the
end
of
4
months
we
simply
handed
it
back
after
exploring
a
large
area
of
France
and
Spain.
An
excellent
company
and
service,
I
have
no
hesitation
in
recommending
them
and
they
were
the
best
cost
wise.

Very

We
are
fully
satisfied
with
the
courtesy
&
promptness
of
service
we
have
experienced
when
dealing
with
this
company.

Their
customer-sevice
people
have
been
very
helpful.
I
have
been
using
this
website
for
years
and
their
selection
has
never
failed
to
amaze.
From
the
bread
and
butter
to
the
rare
they
seem
to
have
everything.
B&H
has
become
my
GO
TO
source
for
both
business
technology
and
consumer
electronics.
These
guys
are
the
model
for
how
eBusiness
should
be
done.
The
customer
service
was
very
good
and
the
delivery
was
very
quick.
I
was
very
surprised
to
see
it
on
my
doorstep
so
quickly.
I
have
used
Parts
Geek
for
the
past
several
purchases
and
very
satisfied
with
their
service.
A
refreshingly
good
online
experience
I
have
used
The
Shower
Doctor
twice
now
to
source
parts
to
repair
my
old
shower.

They
have
a
diagram
showing
how
the
shower
is
put
together
making
it
easy
to
identify
the
parts
needed,
and
for
the
carbon
brushes
needed
this
time,
there
was
a
video
showing
how
to
change
them.

Parts
arrived
quickly.

Saved
me
loads
of
money
and
hassle
of
getting
a
new
shower.
Good
products,
good
prices
and
excellent
selection.

I
am
like
a
kid
in
a
candy
store
when
I
get
on
their
web
site.

And
stuff
comes
in
a
jiffy,
with
tracking
and
everything...good
old
time
service.
It
took
a
while,
but
eventually
a
bitdefender
agent
sorted
my
problem
out
after
SEVERAL

backwards
and
forwards.
Offered
me
an
EXTENSION
to
my
license
key
for
my
troubles,
which
i
thought
was
very
good
of
them.
All-in-all,
a
good
result,
and
i
will
continue
to
use
there

Having

Thank

Discovered
Onnit
through
the
Jason
Ellis
show.

Bought
some
T+,
Hemp
Force
Protein
Bars
and
Powder,
Shroom
Tech,
Coconut
Oil
and
Alpha
Brain.

Happy
to
report
I'm
a
return
shopper,
some
of
the
best
supplements
I've
found
and
great
tasting
too.

Choco
Maca
powder
is
now
my
favorite
tasting
protein
supplement
out
there,
and
the
Vanilla
bars
are
a
great
snack
for
when
you're
hungry.

Appreciative
that
I
was
able
to
find
you
guys,
and
will
continue
buying
in
the
future.
I've
had
SquareTrade
on
a
number
of
things
I
have
bought
over
the
past
few
years,
and
luckily
have
not
had
to
make
any
claims
to
date.

That
is,
until
I
dropped
my
1
year
old
phone
and
the
screen
broke.

I
submitted
my
claim
online,
which
was
approved
within
24
hours.

They
gave
me
the
option
of
getting
the
phone
serviced
myself,
or
sending
it
in
to
be
serviced.

I
chose
the
former,
as
there
was
a
repair
shop
close
that
could
work
on
my
Samsung
and
I
could
get
it
fixed
within
a
day.

After
paying
for
it
myself,
all
I
had
to
do
was
send
the
receipt
in
via
e-mail.

Less
than
a
week
later,
I
was
reimbursed
the
full
amount,
plus
5%
as
I
chose
the
option
to
receive
my
refund
via
Amazon.com
gift
card.

This
was
by
far
the
easiest
insurance
claim
I've
made
on
a
product,
and
was
impressed
that
I
had
no
hassles
in
getting
what
I
needed
fixed
and
reimbursed
in
record
time.

Thanks,
SquareTrade.
Fast
shipping
I
saved
a
fortune
on
the
precise
goods
I
needed
and
they
were
delivered
when
promised
and
free,
I
didn't
have
to
leave
the
house.
Guess
where
I'll
shop
next
time?
thank
you,
Ed.
every

I

Been
buying
ONNIT
products
since
early
this
year,
and
all
I
can
say
is
HEMP
FORCE
is
by
far
the
best
tasting
PROTEIN
out
there!
Joe
Rogan
and
Joey
Diaz
suckered
me
into
buying
this
stuff,
and
I
feel
like
it
has
helped!

Not
only
because
these
fancy
celebrities
told
me
but
because
it
is
a
quality
product.


It
has
also
encouraged
me
to
live
a
healthier
lifestyle.

Thanks
Onnit!
ONNIT
has
been
a
company
that
I
have
trusted
and
used
for
years
now.
And
my
mentor,
Mike
Dolce
partnering
with
them
has
only
made
me
trust
them
more.
They
have
fantastic
customer
service
and
always
respond
quickly
and
with
sincerity.
The
only
problem
I
have
had
with
them
is
that
they
used
Dye
in
one
of
their
supplements,
however,
they
corrected
this
with
their
new
"naked"
program.
Now
I
have
absolutely
no
complaints
and
support
them
to
the
fullest
Website
is
easy
to
use
and
all
products
I've
tried
so
far
are
amazing.
Hi.

If
you

about

through
SquareTrade,
don't!
I've
been
a
faithful

Not

Having
my
favorites
of
the
supplies
I
use
regularly
makes
placing
an
order
a
snap!

I
have
always
received
my
orders
within
two
days
and
cannot
ever
recall
any
items
being
out
of
stock.
I
would
recommend
this
company
to
anyone.
Very
easy
to
use.

really
struggled

the
only
folk
that
carried
a
full
size

subsequently
keeping
my
noggin
safe

warm.
I
have
never
had
any
issues
at
all
with
Urban
Industry,
my
orders
have
always
been
sent
promptly,
turned
up
in
good
time
and
in
one
piece.
I
visited
Cult
Pens
to
find
a
refill
for
an
obscure
japanese
trio
pen.
Not
only
did
I
find
it
easily,
but
I
also
found
pens
I’d
been
trying
to
pick
up
for
months

I
never

I

until
now.
I
love
the
prices
and
ease

however,
Two
of
four
times
I
have
ordered
parts
the
wrong
parts
arrived...When
you
factor
in
the
time
to
schedule
your
installation
of
the
parts,
and
subsequent
realization
that
they
are
WRONG!,
the
30
day
period
is
gone
and
you
are
stuck.
In
my
garage
I
have
front
brakes
for
my
Mini
that
are
for
an
S
and
yes,
I
checked...A
set
of
front
brakes
for
my
Mini
that
received
and
have
no
idea
as
to
what
they
fit
and
look
like
nothing
on
my
car...and
a
heater
hose,
confirmed
by
PartsGeek
as
correct,
that
is
nothing
that
fits
my
X5...Yes,
I
get
what
I
order
most
of
the
time...but
I
am
thinking
maybe
I
should
move
on
as
I
have
a
garage
full
of
parts
for
cars
i
don't
own.
What
good
is
price
when
fit
is
a
failure?
Through
plumbingnetworks
I
had
a
plumber
on
my
phone
20
minutes
after
I
reported
the
problem.
He
was

reasonable
and
got
us
back

fast.

Since
my
first

this
has
been
my
go-to

I
have
told

I
meet
that
this
is
THE
PLACE.
Prompt

Wasn't
sure
about
ordering
parts
from
the
east
coast
to
get
them
here
in
Hawai'i.


The
transaction
went
well
and
part
was
delivered
quickly.

The
quality
of
the
part
was
above
average
and
fit
like
the
original.
I
know
for
a
fact
that
Holiday

However,
there
was
no

on

state
this
fact.

I
will
be

Home
Multi

what

would
expect,
decent

product
but
obviously
not

I
have
always
had
a
friendly
and
helpful
service
from
Cultpens,
their
website
is
easy
to
use
and
their
prices
are,
in
my
opinion,
very
good.
Also
they
have
a
huge
range,
I
would
recommend
them
to
everyone.
I
will
buy
from
Parts

whenever
I
can.
A
very

Efficient

The

was
very
straightforward.
It
stated
that
it
can
take
up

I
was
unable
to
book
on
my
mobile
phone.
I
wound
up
just
going
to
the
hotel
and
having
them
do
it
on
their
computer.
A
little
awkward
and
took
like
20
minutes.
It
wound
up
working
out!
I
ordered
my
math
book
the
first
week
of
school
and
the
book
was
supposed
to
be
sent
in
3
to
5
business
days,
so
I
assumed
since
I
had
ordered
it
in
the
middle
of
the
week
I
would
recieve
the
book
the
next
week,
or
the
week
after
that.
When
I
didn't
receive
my
book
by
the
third
week,
I
looked
up
my
order
with
the
tracking
number.
It
said
my
order
had
been
cancelled.
I
then
contacted
Boobyte
customer
service
to
find
out
why
it
was
cancelled,
and
why
I
had
not
been
notified.
They
told
me
that
when
I
ordered
the
book
they
were
out
of
stock
(which
is
not
what
the
website
said)
and
they
stated
that
an
email
should
have
been
sent
automatically...
I
then
searched
all
my
mail
box's
to
the
account
I
gave
them
and
there
was
no
email,
I
even
checked
the
spam
and
junk
mail
box's
and
searched
for
their
name
in
the
search
box,
nothing.
So
almost
a
month
into
the
class
I'm
stuck
with
three
weeks
worth
of
MATH
homework
to
catch
up
on
with
no
book....
don't
rely
on
Bookbyte.

I
had
never
used
First4Magnets
before
but
I
knew
which
magnets
I
was
in
need
of
and
found
them
on
their
website.
The
website
was
easy
to
use
and
gave
various
delivery
options.
I
selected
the
standard
3
day
option
but,
hey
ho,
they
turned
up
the
next
day.
The
account
manager
was
informing
us
about
any
possibilities
and
changes
immediately
and
reacted
very
promptly.
All
cooperation
was
very
flexible
and
was
supported
with
previews
of
the
final
product.
The
production
and
shipping
time
was
extremely
fast
without
any
delays.
The
final
product
is
just
exactly
as
we
discussed
and
what
was
confirmed
by
us.
We
would
recommend
this
company
to
other
parties.
I
do
my
research
on

I

Fort

was
able
to
work
with
our
builder's
supplier
so
we
had
no
unnecessary
expense
in
replacing
parts
of
the
system.
They
were
prompt
and
courteous,
even
when
the
installer
had
to
go
up
and
down
a
ladder
because
our
stairs
had
just
been
stained.
EXCELLENT

Amazing

Would
reccomend
to
anyone.
Used
this
company
for
the
first
time
ever
about
2
weeks
ago.
As
you
do
with
all
new
suppliers
you
buy
from
you
have
to
set
up
an
account
which
on
most
websites
i
find
to
be
an
utter
nightmare
however
the
setup
process
on
MyProtein
was
simple
and
fast.
I
ordered
odd
sized
special
order
filters.
Ordering
was
simple.
Product
was
fabricated
and
shipped
ahead
of
schedule.
Tracking
notification
was
sent.

Product
was
received
in
tact.
Price
was
fair.
NO
problems.
Wow.
The
end.
I
have
used
eSpares
several
times
now
and
I
find
their
service
excellent.
They
have
a
good
website
with
a
very
comprehensive
product
range
and
I
can
always
expect
super
quick
delivery.

very
happy
with

Only
problem
is
the
butterfly
system
as
it
feels
very
uncomfortable
while
using.
Overall
great
bench
I
got
a
damaged
part
from
partsgeek.
The
damage
was
obvious.
Besides,
it
looked
like
a
customer
return.
Factory
box
was
open
and
had
some

RMA
number
written
on
it.
The
return
process
was
smooth.
But,
they
didn't
offer
to
pay
the
return
sipping.
I
didn't
insist,
because
the
price
for
the
part
was
low.
What
did
surprise
me,
was
that
they
didn't
refund
the
shipping
part
of
the
order.
I
don't
mind
paying
shipping
if
I
made
a
mistake
ordering.
I
expect
the
same
thing
from
a
merchant.
The
funniest
thing
was
that
the
replacement
part
I
got
from
them
was
not
much
better.
The
best
price
I
found
for
my
new
brake
calipers
which
arrived
the
next
day!!
Very
happy!!
I
have
purchased
thousands
of
dollars
of
cameras,
lens.
and
accessories
from
B&H
for
fifteen
years.

I
was
burned
once
by
another
online
site
and
found
B&H
and
never
left.

There
is
no
'bait
and
switch',
no
BS.

B&H
has
honored
every
claim
made
on
their
site.

Their
integrity
and
product
honesty
is
beyond
reproach.

I
returned
a
$2200
lens
with
in
the
14
day
period
conforming
to
the
return
policy
instructions
and
was
credited
the
purchase
with
no
questions
asked.

Not
only
do
I
highly
recommend
B&H,
I'll
go
so
far
as
to
say,
don't
even
waste
your
time
with
other
sites.
The
costume

I've
used
aferry
twice
now
to
cross
to
France
and
back
and
their
interface
is
easy
to
use,
just
put
in
a
date
and
get
comparison
of
companies
showing
times,
cost
and
service.
Much
easier
than
going
to
all
the
different
ferry
companies
sites.
Friendly
and
efficient
service.
I'm
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
my
contract
renewal
is
handled
within
the
notice
period
required
by
the
supplier
and
I
achieve
the
most
competative
price
available.
JO

handled
all
the
'official
stuff'
thoroughly,
with
great
humour
and
understanding
-
really
refreshing
when
we
get
so
many
uninvited
'cold
calls'
from
unknown
origins.
I
can
always
count
on
B&H
We
have
bought
our

from
Titmuss
since

having
her

their

has
always
been

When

ONCE
AGAIN,
VERY
SPEEDY
DELIVERY.
Fast
and
friendly
service
i
ordered
a
ps3
version
of
Syndicate
&
the
sony
wireless
7.1
headphones.
shop
to
net
were
great,as
usual
but
i
was
let
down
by
the
courier
TNT
who
dont
have
a
local
depot
to
me(in
Bournemouth).
I
ordered
a
number
of
guitar
pedals
though
the
GAK
website,
one
in
particular
was
displayed
as
an
older
"more
desireable"
model,
when
I
recieved
the
product
it
was
the
newer
less
impressive
version.
There
was
no
communication
explaining
that
this
was
being
sent
instead
of
the
one
shown.
The
delivery
itself
was
great,
and
I
was
very
happy
with
the
rest
of
the
order,
I
would
not
recommend
people
buy
pedals
from
this
retailer
if
they
are
fussy
about
the
version
you
desire
(I'm
fussy
in
this
respect).
Everything
works
perfect
but
at
the
end
you
pay
more,
they
hide
fees.
Shopping
for
big
clothes
used
to
be
a
real
drag.

Did
not
like
it.

Now,
with
Big
Tall
Direct,
it's
easy.

I
get
notices
of
good
sales
and
the
website
is
intuitive
so
my
time
is
not
wasted.

Quality
products
at
great
prices.

What
could
be
better?

And
Big
Tall
Direct
ships
via
Federal
Express.

No
more
hassles
with
"the
other
big
parcel
company."
It
was
a
pleasant
experience.
Good
selection,
found
what
I
wanted,
sensible
price
and
it
was
delivered
on
time.
I
had
ordered
an
e-card
to
be
sent
to
my
niece
and
nephew
for
the
holidays.

It
took
three
days
fore
the
e-card
to
arrive.

As
this
was
a
digital
delivery
I
do
not
understand
why
it
too
so
long.

I
would
have
chosen
physical
delivery
if
I
had
know
that
the
e-card
took
so
long
to
be
delivered.

Because
of
the
delay,
the
e-card
did
not
get
to
them
until
after
the
holiday.
The
part
I
thought
ordered
based
upon
the
photo
does
not
match
what
was
shipped
to
my
home.
The
photo
was
a
rear
wheel
hub
assy,
however
only
a
bearing
was
shipped
to
me.
We
live
about
35
miles
from
the
nearest
place
to
purchase
the
same
Pro
Plan
dog
food
so
with
the
current
fuel
prices
we
consider
you
an
outstanding
find.
Top
notch
service
got
it
fast
and
it
works
perfectly
:)
AFEyewear
not
only
had
the
exact
lenses
i
was
looking
for,
they
had
them
for
hundreds
less
than
I
could
get
them
anywhere
else.

The
processing
took
less
than
the
initial
estimate
and
the
shipping
was
quick.

I
would
order
again
without
hesitation
and
I
would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
looking
for
new
glasses.
Ordered
the
Fantech
hp190.
eComfort
was
the
lowest
price
on
the
internet,
had
free
shipping
and
turned
the
order
quickly.

I
have
already
installed
the
fan
and
it's
working
as
it
should.
One
of
the
easiest
sites
to
navigate
and
to
find
places
to
stay.
The
map
with
the
places
that
are
available,
make
it
really
easy
to
browse.
Love
that.
Communication
and
booking
was
easy
and
smooth.
The
only
problems
I
had
were
in
communicating
with
some
of
the
hosts.
When
making
the
initial
contact
via
HouseTrip,
they
didn't
get
back
to
me
(don't
know
if
the
message
didn't
get
forwarded
to
them,
or
lost
on
the
way
back),but
once
they
replied
and
I
had
their
email
address
it
was
no
problem.
These
sites
are
usually
a
nightmare,
but
not
this
one.
I
could
see
exactly
what
I
was
supposed
to
do,
no
ambiguous
questions.
Enter
what
you
want,
press
return,
and
see
what
you've
done!
No
waiting
30
seconds
to
see
if
it
actually

is
doing
what
is
says
it's
doing
with
that
temptation
to
press
return
again
and
ruin
the
whole
process.
Easy
and
quick,
what
else
do
you
want?
Recommended?
Yes,
definitely.

Made

Never
have
had
a
bad
experience
with
Hodges
Badge
Company
in
all
the
many
years
our
club
has
been
working
with
them!
Their
productions
are
excellent
and
the
service
first
rate.
My
experience
with
this
company
was
positive.
I
am
moving
house
and
have
been
selling
stuff
as
we
are
down-sizing.

To
sell
old
books
and
DVD's
we
have
used
We
Buy
Books,
Ziffit,
Music
Magpie
and
Zapper.

ZIFFIT
have
by
far
been
the
best
company
to
deal
with.

I
have
sent
a
total
of
4
batches
to
them
and
I
have
received
cleared
payment
to
my
PayPal
account
for
all
my
trades.

I
am
still
waiting
to
hear
from
Music
Magpie
and
Zapper
to
even
confirm
if
they
have
even
received
my
boxes
and
it's
been
over
a
week
since
I've
sent
them.

If
I
had
my
time
over
I
would
have
sent
all
my
old
stuff
to
ZIFFIT
-
I
strongly
recommend
ZIFFIT
and
that's
coming
from
someone
who
never
usually
reads
or
writes
reviews.
I
have
purchased
the
800
Elite
scooter
from
this
company.

The
stock
drive
sprocket
is
must
faster
than
the
hill
gear
sprocket.

I
pre-paid
at
the
time,
and
Alex,
the
owner
offered
the
extra
hill
gear,
spare
chain,
tool
kit,
stainless
steel
hardware,
and
excellent
service.

The
unit
came
with
the
hill
gear
installed.

All
items
he
sells
are
listed
as
free
shipping.

There
are
no
hidden
charges.

The
invoice
will
show
the
shipping,
but
what
you
see
advertised
is
your
cost.
This
site
was
easy
to
use.

I
did
look
into
some
product
reviews
before
making
a
decision.

I
trust
everything
will
work
out
just
fine.
Fast
and
easy
ordering,
I
ordered
a
citizen
divers
watch
from
deepblue
and
paid
extra
for
next
day
delivery.
After
3
days
it
hadn't
turned
up
so
I
contacted
them
and
they
told
me
it
would
be
least
2
weeks.
Quick,
cheap,
quality
service,
outrageous
selection,
what
else
is
there
to
say
I
was
able
to
go
on
line,
easily
find
the
part
I
needed,
get
it
at
a
great
price
and
have
it
in
my
hands
3
days
later.
The
product
arrived
exactly
as
it
was
promised
and
I
was
able
to
install
it
in
under
ten
minutes.
The
dealership
had
quoted
a
price
of
$120
just
for
installing
the
part!!!
I
have
used
the
Star
Trac
eSpinner
Indoor
Spin
Bike
at
the
gym
for
the
last
year
and
decided
I
needed
one
of
my
own.

Tim
was
great
to
work
with
during
the
order
process
and
scheduling
delivery.

Francisco
showed
up
at
the
agreed
upon
time
and
delivered
the
bike
and
ensured
it
worked
properly
before
leaving.

I
would
highly
recommend
Fitness
Superstore
to
anyone
in
the
market
for
gym
equipment.
The
word
"EXCELLENT"
said
everything,
do
you
agree?
God
pris,
skøn
vin,
problemfri
levering
-
hvad
mere
kan
man
ønske?
They
had
what
I
needed
at
a
substantial
savings
and
were
quick
to
get
it
to
me.
My
mate
Amy
says
that
her
optician
sends
her
free
samples
of
different
new
lenses,
because
she's
got
one
eye
that's
just
weird,
and
none
of
them
fit
comfortably
anyway.
You're
not
going
to
get
that
level
of
personal
service
online,
but
on
the
other
had
Amy's
optician
is
in
Cambridge
and
Amy
works
in
Marlow
which
is
like
2
hours
away
so
it
not
exactly
local.
Wait
on
phone
was
too
long.
First
time
I
have
used
appliances
online
but
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
from
them
again.
I
think
someone
mismarked
the
shirts.
One
xlt
looked
like
a
4x.I
am
sorry
it
didn't
work
out---maybe
next
time.
Workiong
through
the
website
was
an
easy
thing
to
do
and
I
could
quickly
find
the
product
I
wanted.
The
ordering
process
was
very
straight
forward
and
I
could
place
my
order
as
easily
as
I
have
elsewhere.
My
order
arrived
within
a
couple
of
days
and
it
was
packaged
to
a
very
high
standard.
All
in
all
a
pleasurable
company

deal
with..Pit
I
have
to
wait
until

This
is
the
second
time
I've
used
photoworld,
and
am
very
happy
with
their
speed
and
efficiency
and
the
quality
of
the
album.
We've
decided
to
keep
an
album
recording
each
year's
events
now
and
wish
we'd
done
it
earlier.
Sanderson

by
Bedeckhome
-
what's

like.
Quick
efficient
and
well
packaged.
I
was
disappointed
because
I
gave
my
physical
address
which
is
on
my
package.
BUT
IT
WAS
SENT
TO
MY
LOCAL
POST
OFFICE.
WHICH
I
don't
understand
how
that
happen.
Wonderful
experience
calling
and
getting
connected
with
an
appointment
to
a
storage
facility
that
I'd
never
have
found
if
not
for
Sparefoot.

Was
a
good
experience.
Great
price.
Great
delivery
times.
Great
customer
service.

I
have
been
a
customer
of
PCGameSupply
for
well
over
a
year
now.
I
have
had
very
little
trouble
with
them.
Very
useful,
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
more
complicated
than
it
was,
worked
fast
and
affeciently
I
am
a
shareholder
in
Brockmans
,
but
as
it
is
not
widely
avaailable
in
retail
outlets
I
bought
through
you.
B&H
was
recommended
by
a
professional
photographer
friend
and
I
agree
it
is
a
great
place
to
shop.

Nearly
always
find
what
I
want
and
always
at
very
competitive
prices.

Highly
recommend
it.
The
models
from
1001modelkits
are
excellent.
The
delivery
was
fine
but
you
do
have
take
in
consideration
that
some
items
ship
from
overseas.
So
the
waiting
period
may
be
a
few
weeks.
However,
every
model
builder
knows
that
it
does
take
time
to
get
items.
My
items
actually
came
in
a
few
days
earlier
than
expected.
That
made
me
happy,
happy,
happy.
They
do
have
models
that
are
hard
to
find.
All
this
together
makes
it
a
great
experience
and
I
will
be
ordering
from
them
again
in
the
near
future.
I
ordered
industrial
AAA
bateries.
The
web
site
was
easy
to
navigate
and
the
ordering
was
simple.
The
batteries
were
ordered
Monday
PM
and
arrived
first
thing
Wednesday
morning,
they
were
well
packed
and
exactly
what
I
was
looking
for.
The
greenhouse
was
delivered
earlier
than
expected,
the
person
who
delivered
it
was
cheerful
and
very
helpful,
giving
me
tips
on
the
construction
of
the
greenhouse.
after
reading
the
instructions
carefully
I
laid
all
the
parts
out
and
checked
them.
I
had
no
problems
building
the
greenhouse
by
myself,
the
only
time
I
needed
assistance
was
when
fitting
the
assembled
sections
together,
which
took
about
ten
minutes.
I
ordered
a
coolant
valve
for
my
car
it
came
in
2
days
and
was
the
right
part
and
I
have
had
no
problems
with
it.
I
will
shop
here
again.
Great
dealer
low
prices
and
quick
service!
Im
like
a
kid
in
the
candy
store
when
I
go
there.
Everything
is
priced
great
and
I
dont
feel
like
im
getting
ripped
off.
The
employees
are
top
knotch
also.
Im
a
chef
and
I
WILL
NEVER
shop
anywhere
else
for
my
supplies.
Website
had
some
issues,
had
to
close
cart
and
go
to
account
in
order
to
change
shipping
address.
Like
that
I
could
use
Google
Checkout.
Had
the
item
I
seached
for
at
a
"great"
price,and
shipped
it
fast.
The
tour
covers
a
huge
distance.
You
see
the
most
important
spots
in
London.
There
are
so
many
buses
going
through.
It
is
recommended
when
you
do
nbot
have
much
time
and
you
cannot
walk
for
very
long
(children,
elderly,
disabled,
etc.).
A
tip:
since
it
si
quite
expensive
(as
everything
in
cedntral
London),
make
an
online
booking
in
advance;
you'll
save
a
good
amount
of
pounds.
I've
used
a
number
of
similar
sites,
but
prefer
Pond5.
The
contract
is
easy
to
understand
and
less
restrictive
than
some
sites.
The
layout
of
the
site
is
good,
and
I've
noticed
that
certain
other
sites
have
copied
it,
such
as
hovering
to
preview.
I
also,
like
being
able
to
see
entire
audio
waveforms
and
play
them
in
full.
Prices
are
generally
good,
although
I
see
some
artists
have
raised
prices
to
match
other
sites
they
post
on
(some
don't
give
the
option
to
set
your
own
price).
It's
a
good
site,
both
for
creators
and
consumers.
Checkout
and
download
is
easy.
Would
definitely
recommend
Pond5
to
others.
Easy
to
use
website
with
a
great
range
of
products
to
suit
everyone's
needs.
Great
service
and
reliable.
Can
not
fualt
them
for
quality
and
efficiency.
I
ordered
some
tile
cleaning
fluids
as
the
builders
who'd
installed
the
tiled
floor
in
the
kitchen
had
left
it
in
a
bit
of
a
state.
I
ordered
on
the
Sunday
and
the
stuff
arrived
by
tuesday
which
was
great.
Bestbuy

Nuff

This
represents
the
start
of
my
endeavor
to
present
an
issue
to
the
public
relating
to
money
handling
by
PeoplePerHour,
which
is
the
result
of
several
days
of
correspondence.
I
think
it
is
incredibly
important
that
potential
customers
are
made
aware
of
what
is
going
on
at
PeoplePerHour,
and
i
will
therefore
avoid
any
conjecture,
or
emotive
language,
which
might
suggest
that
this
is
merely
sour
grapes
over
a
dispute.
Can'

Purchased
the
BF3
Russian
key
Saturday
afternoon,
and
about
7
hours
later
I
got
the
key
in
the
e-mail.
No
instructions
to
convert
to
english,
but
those
are
easily
found
elsewhere.
The
key
is
working
great.
Only
negative
is
that
I
wish
they
had
e-mailed
the
key
sooner
(ie.
instantly).
Overall,
good
transation.
I
can't
begin
to
count
all
the
uses
I've
found
for
these
products.
Hunting,
working
in
tight,
dark
places,
etc,
etc.
The
products
deliver
an
astounding
amount
of
light
and
features,
and
always
work.

They
are
relatively
easy
to
change
batteries
on,
and
I've
never
had
a
problem
with
their
service.
Thumbs

When
we
told
our
team
they
were
getting
plaques,
they
groaned
expecting
something
ugly
and
cheap.
When
we
handed
them
the
PlaqueMaker
plaques
their
attitude
turned
around
immediately.

The
PlaqueMaker
plaque
generated
a
lot
of
buzz
within
the
company.
The
printing,
metalwork
and
woodwork
were
all
perfect.

From
the
purchaser's
perspective,
PlaqueMaker
was
great
to
work
with,
offered
a
competitive
price,
and
put
up
with
some
last
minute
changes
with
good
grace.
Received
everything
as
expected.
Fast
shipping
and
great
prices.
I
appreciate
Rev's
service,
it's
fast
and
useful.
I
had
some
problems
with
the

called
the

and
got
solved
immediately.
I
always
buy
my
kit
from
Heinnie,
because
of
the
prices,
choice
and
the
great
customer
service.
Ordered
a
gas
cap
and
was
told
they
first
had
to
approve

Then
received
message
advising
that
the

could
not
be
canceled
for
any
reason.
Went
a
few
days
and
received
another
e-mail
advising
that
my
payment
was
being
refunded
no
explanation
provided.
Several
days
since
the
last
e-mail
and
no
refund.
Would
have
been
nice
to
know
why
they
couldn't
fill
my
order,
maybe
there
was
a
legitimate
reason
they
couldn't

fill
the
order
but
no
one
took
the
time
to
explain.
Ordered
from

ordered
from

got
an

and
shorty
after
they
sent

The
goods
arrived
the
next
day,
exactly
as
ordered
and
well
packed.
Great

an
excellent
experience
with
FramesDirect
from
the
first

I
found
their

to
the
time
I
received
my
glasses.
Their
website
is
easy
to
navigate
and
my

were
as
expected.
I
had
question
about
how

with

Top

I
can't
recommend
these
guys
highly
enough.
Found
what
I
wanted
quickly.
You
were
the
best
price.
Ordering
took
60
seconds
and
then
it

before
it
said
it
would.
Brilliant.
Lovely

Well

Amazingly

Thanks.
We
got
3
sets
of
StarMarque
business
cards
delivered
last
week
and
we
were
bowled
over
with
the
quality.
Upon
enquiring,
the
staff
were
very
helpful
and
friendly,
the
cards
were
completed
ahead
of
the
estimated
date
and
the
quality
was
second-to-none!
This
was
my
first
time
using
Hostelbookers
and
it
was
great!
I
was
looking
for
a
place
in
Kolkata,
India
and
I
tried
making
a
reservation
through
a
hostel's
website.
When
my
reservation
wasn't
confirmed,
I
turned
to
Hostelbookers.
Not
only
did
they
provide
great
information
and
confirm
my
reservation,
but
the
price
was
even
a
bit
cheaper!
The
fact
that
I
didn't
have
to
pay
a
booking
fee
was
great.
I'd
surely
use
them
again.
Only
downside
is
the
limited
selection
and
number
of
reviews
people
have
left.
Extremely
quick,
informative
transaction
followed
by
next
day
delivery.
I

Great

service.

The
final
product
looks
beautiful.

I
will
use
them
again.

My
customer
is
very
happy.
This
is
the
second
time
we
have
ordered
from
Inkfarm.com
and
would
do
so
again.

We
were
totally
satisfied
with
all
aspects
of
service
from
this
company
as
well
as
their
product.
I
had
a
problem
with
my
order
and
when
this
problem
was
recognized,
Goodens'
not
only
took
accountability,
but
corrected
the
order
and
did
so
with
expedited
processing,
over-night
delivery
and
no
charge
or
inconvenience
(other
than
the
delay)
to
me.

I
would
have
no
problem
at
all
in
dealing
with
them
again.

I
got
a
great
deal
on
a
Vintage
V100
guitar
from
DV's
B
stock
list,
the
price
was
amazing,
and
the
guitar
turned
up
the
next
day.

What's
even
better,
the
courier
sent
me
a
text
giving
me
a
one
hour
slot
in
which
to
expect
delivery,
then
turned
up
precisely
one
minute
into
the
time
window
-
brilliant.

My
guitar
was
well
set-up
out
of
the
box,
looks,
sound
and
plays
wonderfully,
and
although
it
was
a
repaired
item,
I
could
see
no
sign
of
it
having
been
worked
on
(plus
it
has
a
12
month
warranty).

I
gigged
it
for
the
first
time
yesterday,
and
it
blew
me,
and
the
rest
of
the
band,
away.

I
can't
believe
I
got
such
a
great
instrument
for
such
a
good
price.

I've
always
had
great
service
from
Digital
Village,
but
this
time
they've
surpassed
myself.

They're
always
my
first
stop
when
I'm
looking
for
gear.
My
first
order
from
PartsGeek
was
a
cover
for
my
car.

The
price
was
below
most
of
their
competitors,
shipping
was
fast
and
the
quality
far
exceeded
my
expectations.

I
walked
in
to
the
Johnston
RI

store
location,
my
intent
was
to
have
my
tires
rotated.
Based
on
the
amount
of
people
waiting
I
was
going
to
be
there
for
a
long
time.

I
was
told
that
the
wait
would
be
between
2
to
3
hours
and
that
there
were
6
vehicles
ahead
of
mine.

I
had
a
nice
conversation
with
one
of
the
guys
behind
the
counter
.
During
the
time
that
I
was
waiting,
we
also
check
on
the
next
set
of
tires
I
will
be
needing
in
the
near
future
for
another
car.

Then
he
told
me
that
my
vehicle
was
completed
and
I
did
not
even
realize
I
was
there
for
2
hours.


I
will
return
because
of
the
service
I
received.

WHAT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO

FOR
ME
TO
RECTIFI
MY
$150.00
PROBLEM?
I
arrived
early
to
see
two
familiar
faces
smiling
at
me.

Work
to
change
all
four
tyres
started
immediately.
Benjamin-my
youngest
son-
was
made
most
welcome
in
the
reception
office.
I
mentioned
my
most
recent
vehicle
service
from
the
Mazda
garage
I
used
and
once
again
I
was
given
priceless
information
from
the
service
team
at
Blackcircles.
My
knowledge
gained
will
be
of
benefit
both
to
myself
and
Noyland
and
Rhodes
as
I
intend
to
get
my
present
and
future
cars
serviced
there
as
well!
A
project
came
up
suddenly
for
the
need
of
marketing
materials
for
our
new
sales
person.
We
decided
to
make
a
promotional
video
of
our
product
and
hand
it
out
in
flash
drives.
I
found
Flashbay
and
was
amazed
at
how
quick
they
moved.
The
next
day
I
had
a
sample
pack
and
digital
proofs
of
our
logo
on
the
product.
We
decided
to
go
with
the
Pop
model
and
had
them
in
less
than
a
week.
The
product
we
received
is
exactly
what
was
expected.
Sam
my
sales
person
was
wonderful
he
did
an
excellent
job
with
everything.
I
purchased
a
third
brake
light
for
my
car
from
Parts
Geek
due
to
their
low
prices
and
free
shipping.

I
received
the
light
in
a
few
days
which
was
faster
than
I
had
expected.

It
worked
so
all
is
fine.
Well,
there
ARE
other
search
engines
but
honestly,
why
would
I
bother?
None
offer
the
speed
and
interconnectivity
that
Google
do,
and
the
Chrome
browser
is
the
best
out
there.
Firstly
I
must
say
that
I've
found
Amazon
to
be
mostly
reliable,
but
Ooooh
when
they
get
something
wrong...
I
recently
pre-ordered
a
videogame
from
them
and
when
it
had
failed
to
arrive
by
the
Monday
after
release
I
phoned
contacted
them,
only
to
hear
that
I'd
have
to
wait
the
usual
(11?)
working
days
before
reporting
it
lost.
Nothing
arrived
so
I
complained
again,
and
a
replacement
was
finally
sent.
In
the
meantime,
because
it
was
a
birthday
gift,
I
had
to
buy
a
second
copy
elsewhere
(from
shopto.net
incidentally)
which
was
ordered
at
7pm
on
the
Monday
and
arrived
the
NEXT
morning!
FIVE
days
after
the
original
11-day
wait
the
replacement
arrived
from
Amazon,
and
then,
a
week
later
what
I
could
only
presume
was
the
original
order
arrived,
post
dated
well
after
it
should
have
been
shipped
(it
was
a
pre-order
remember?),
but
before
the
replacement
was
posted.
This
of
course
I
returned
which
was
a
simpleprocess
that
cost
me
nothing
extra
but
was
an
unwanted
hassle
nonetheless.
I
keep
looking
at
their
competitors
with
a
view
to
trying
them
out
and
end
up
thinking
"why
bother?"
I've
been
using
eBay
and
Paypal
for
several
years
now
and
found
them
an
extremely
safe
and
rewarding
way
to
buy
but
also
to
sell
unwanted
items,
and
things
that
used
to
go
to
the
dump
or
get
traded
in
to
highstreet
stores
for
next
to
nothing
now
often
sell
for
some
handy
pocket
money.
There's
nothing
more
pleasing
than
finding
that
someone
out
there
values
something
you
don't
want
anymore
(last
year
I
sold
a
25
year-old
Millenium
Falcon
Airfix
model,
broken
in
pieces
to
a
model
collector
who
was
delighted
with
it!)
I
don't
know
what
I'd
do
without
Paypal
to
be
honest,
but
they
could
drop
their
prices
slightly,
I
used
to
wonder
how
they
functioned
for
the
money,
now
I
don't.
Shopto.net
are
my
favoured
games
supplier
because
of
their
unfailing
reliability
(games
often
arrive
the
day
before
official
release)
and
their
constant
policy
of
keeping
prices
real.
There
are
cheaper
online
stores
out
there
(but
not
many)
but
none
more
reliable
in
my
experience.
I
have
had
ONE
item
not
arrive
on
time
in
3+
years
of
using
them,
and
that
was
lost
by
Royal
Mail.
Shopto.net
offered
me
a
replacement
or
a
full
credit
immediately.
Fast,
efficient
and
flexible
solutions
Mike
and
Matt
are
the
best.
I
called
on
a
Thursday
with
questions.
Ordered
on
Friday
and
received
my
order
on
Monday.Fast
service
and
FREE
shipping.
I
will
do
business
with
these
guys
again.
Parts
Geek
is
the
kind
of
company

I
recommend
to
everyone.
They
very
rarely
do
not
have
what
I
need
and
it
is
shipped
very
quickly.
Their
prices
can't
be
beat
and
quality
of
the
parts
I
have
bought
so
far
has
been
good.
They
shipped
a
wrong
part
to
me
once
and
although
communicating
through
e-mail
was
slow,
they
completely
handled
the
return
and
shipped
the
correct
part
right
away.
Parts
Geek
has
earned
my
trust.
Cheap!
Fast!
Quality!
Says
it
all.
What
more
could
you
ask
for.
Good
prices,
fast
shipping
and
excellent
products.
Smooth
and
seamless
as
usual
despite
the
severe
weather
the
country
has
been
experiencing
this
winter.
THX!
Use

5
times
and
they
have
come
through
every
time!
Even
when
ATT
was
blocking
unlocking
phones
they
work
with
me
a
communicated
through
out
the
time.

on
Monday
evening
at
9pm
ish,
delivered
Wednesday

Product
was
exactly
as
described
and
the
speed
of

fantastic.
No
hesitation
in
using
this
company
again
:)
order
has
not
arrived
Of
course,
if
it
had
been
a
non-free
gift,
I
would've
been
a
little
peeved.

The
pen
I
bought
was
one
recommended
on
the
web
site,
and
I'm
very
happy
with
it
so
far.
I
received
my
order
(replacement
mirror)
broken
and
unusable.
There
was
no
contact
info
on
the
shipping
bill
so
I
had
to
try
to
find
them
on
the
internet.
Once
I
found
them
I
discovered
that
there
is
no
easy
way
to
reach
them.
I
tried
calling
but
was
routed
to
a
3rd
party
with
a
long
wait
so
I
tried
to
email
them
and
am
still
waiting
for
a
reply
after
24
hrs.
I
went
to
the
local
auto
parts
store
and
ordered
it
from
them.
I
will
have
it
tomorrow
but
it
looks
like
I
am
out
the
money
I
sent
partsgeek.
Never
again.
I
already
have
an
Account
with
your
rival,
MoneyCorp.
So
I
was
able
to
compare
their
rate
that
I
would
have
previously
settled
on
with
the
one
finally
secured
by
TransferWise.
I
was
able
to
secure
an
average
of
2.8%
more
Euros
than
Moneycorp
would
have
paid.
Naturally,
I
intend
to
pursue
TransferWise
services
in
future.
Great
service
and
great
savings
Totally
satisfied.

Very
quick
service.
JUST
ORDER
AND
GO
VERY
GOOD
SERVICE,AND
FAST
DELIVERY
ONLY
WAY
TO
GO
AND
GET
THINGS
DONE
No
hassle
and
I
got
what
I
wanted.

Thanks
for
doing

who
I
go
to
when
I
need

Simply
the
best.
Best

This
was
my
first
purchase
from
eEuroparts,
but
the
part
was
clearly
and
accurately
described
and
depicted;

was
lower
than
any
other
source
I
could
find,
and
it

I'm
very
happy
with
my

THANKYOU
The
RD12D
dehumidifier
is
brilliant,
it
is
so
quiet
you
can
leave
it
on
all
night
and
not
lose
any
sleep.It
really
does
take
a
lot
of
condensation
out
of
the
atmosphere.
I
needed
to
find
serpentine

pulleys
for
my
2003
LandRover

and

was
the
only
one
I
could
find
that
had
all
three.

I
ordered
and
they
shipped
them
out
fast
and
I
got
them
fast.

I
will
definitely
be
buying
from
them
again!

Couldn't

asked
for
better

and

The
shuttle
driver,
Frank,
was
wonderful
and
really
made
the

enjoyable,
it
was
a
highlight
of

It's
a

I
had
to
phone
to
sort
out
a
problem
(that
I
had
created)
with
my
order.
What
a
treat
to
talk
with
someone
who
not
only
took
an
interest
in
resolving
my
issue,
but
it
was
like
talking
with
someone
I
had
known
for
years!
Very
straightforward
set
of
products.
Good
pricing.
Never
had
to
make
a
claim
so
only
reason
not
getting
five
stars
very
good
price
and
fast
delivery,
will
use
again.
I
ordered
two
french
tip
straight
catheters
about
one
month
a
go.

I
have
had
to
boil
and
mold
the
straight
catheters
to
make
it
curved
since
no
one
makes
the
curved
ones
anymore.

After
boiling
and
molding
the
catheters,
I
noticed
the
opening
was
no
longer
tapered.

It
hurt
to
insert
the
catheter
because
the
tip
was
too
large.

It
was
a
wasted
$30.

At
first
I
thought
I
had
ordered
the
wrong
tip.

I
ordered
two
more
and
upon
delivery,
I
quickly
noticed
the
tips
were
french
tipped
and
tapered
to
my
liking.

I
boiled
a
third
one
and
sure
enough,
the
tip
lost
it
shape,
even
at
very
shoert
boil.

Frustrated,
I
finally
was
able
to
boil
just
the
middle
of
the
catheter
and
the
4th
time
was
the
charm.

I
am
sure
I
can't
be
the
only
person
frustrated
with
not
having
the
option
of
a
curved
catheter.

I
am
also
out
$45
on
catheters
that
if
I
were
to
use
them,

could
very
easily
cause
harm
to
my
internal
valve.
P.S.
I
would
feel
much
better
if
I
were
to
receive
a
refund.
It
is

Dude,
I
had
a

at
the

went

I
bought
dozen
itunes
gift
cards
from
pcgamesupply,
I
had
a
issue
with
one
of
my
orders,
so
I
contacted
the
support,
they
answered
in
less
than
30
minutes
and
I
was
the
one
who
made
a
mistake.
Great
site!
Ordered
a
key
from
these
guys
who
delivered
it
within
5
minutes
of
payment.
Key
authenticated
fine,
exactly
what
you
need.
I
was
very
skeptical
buying
a
cd
key
online,

as
the
price
was
nearly
£20
less
than
the
official
Guild

digital
download.
You
know
the
saying,
if
it's
too
good
to
be
true...
then
it
probably
is!
Part
does
not
fit
my
2008
Jetta
even
though
it
lists
as
an
OEM
replacement.
Which
isn't
a
big
deal.
Return
policy
is
0
hassle
but
shipping
a
return
is
on
my
dime.
Which
seems
a
little
iffy
because
I
used
their
program
to
pick
the
part
and
according
to
that
program
it
should
fit.
So
I'm
out
8.00
in
return
shipping.
This
is
my
only
complaint
(other
than
the
part
not
being
for
my
car)
return
policy
will
prevent
me
from
using
them
again.
Too
many
other
places
provide
free
return
shipping
for
incorrect
shipped
parts.
Easy
to
reserve,
easy
to
find,
easy
to
pay,
easy
to
get

Unibaggage
are
a
fantastic
company
and
looked
after
my
bag
for
me
and
better
still
it
arrived
all
in
1
piece
(unlike
their
rivals
who
I've
switched
from).
Their
customer
service
on
the
phone,
twitter
and
Facebook
is
excellent
and
they're
very
helpful
esp
when
I
start
panicking
about
where
my
bag
is
as
it
always
goes
off
the
radar
after
Aberdeen.
Their
Customer
Service
is
so
good
that
they
can
link
my
twitter
accounts
and
my
unibaggage
account
even
though
they're
in
different
names!
Can't
recommend
them
enough!
Rev.com
transcribed
a
27-minute
talk
for
me,
and
it
came
back

and
quicker

promised.
Will
definitely
use
them
again.
I
found
it
very
convenient
to

time
I

The

Guitar
I
bought
is
superb...
The
first
frame
I
ordered
did
not
look
good
when
I
first
tried
them
on.


However,
the
company
promptly
refunded
my
money
when
I
returned
the
frames.


Subsequently,
I
purchased
a
second
frame
and
they
were
"fabulous"
!




I
am

the

When
I
was
fitting
the
riser
bar
to
my
shower
I
cracked
the
bracket
at
the

point.This
rendered
it
useless
and
to
make
matters
worse
I
damaged
the
bottom

when
I
removed
it.I
tried
various
places
including
the

to

I

As
the
Victoria
Plumb
advert
states,I
did
shop
around
comparing
quality
and
prices.Some
others
had
fair
quality
but
due
to
stock
shortages
they
could
not
supply
a
matching
set
.Others
were
poor
quality
and
I
could
see
they
would
become
pitted
and
rusty
in
a
few
months.
I
went
to
Victoria
Plumb,
everything
was
in
stock
the
prices
were
good.Everything
arrived
on
the
stated
delivery
day.The
quality
was
excellent
and
every
item
felt
solid
and
strong,also
they
came
with
all
screws
and
wallplugs
,which
some
other
suppliers
did
not
provide.Great
value
and
great
customer
service!

First
of
all
we
were

minutes

to

off

Fair

I
hadn't
given
them
my
mobile

it
turned
out
they
were
looking
for
the

I

I

had

This
is
my
first
time
using
supplementwarehouse.com
and
i
was
really
surprise
on
just
the
value
or
all
the
supplements
i
needed.
The
checkout
process
was
really
fast
and
easy.
And
the
great
thing
is
they
offer
a
lot
of
free
items
to
go
only
with
your
purchase.
This
is
my
first
time
using
this
website,
but
its
already
saved
on
my
computer
and
i
will
be
buying
here
every
month.
They
have
won
me
over
for
life,
i
will
tell
all
my
friends
and
family
about
this

Im
happy
and

The
transaction
could
not
have
been
any
easier
I
can`t
beleive
how
cheap
those
toothbrushes
are
i`ll
never
buy
the
real
ones
again
,they
are
so
expensive,I`m
going
to
buy
them
from
Molarclean
from
now
on
,
there
so
cheap
and
look
and
do

exactly
like
the
the
dear
ones.
We
were
lead
to
believe
that
we
were
renting
a
Mercedes
A-class
or
similar.

We
got
a
Skoda
Roomster.

No
disrespect
for
the
Skoda
brand,
it
has
served
us
well
in
the
past,
but
there
is
no
comparison.

The
1.2L
engine
was
underpowered
for
the
fast
paced
European
highways
and
that
was
especially
noticeable
when
overtaking
semi's
at
>90
km/h.

The
cars'
appearance
and
the
service
from
the
people
at
the
desk
in
Zaventem
airport
was
however
impeccable,
no
complaints
there
at
all.
Manager
was
extremely
helpful
and
we
never
felt
pressure.
Amazing
purchases.
I'll
order
all
my
parts
from
PartsGeek
from
now
on.
WOW
Super
deals
love
the
combo
packs
with
free
bonus
As
I
said,
the
idea
is
very
good,
the
service
is
very
good
and
trustworthy.
Quick
and
easy
service
to
use.
Instructions
are
easy
to
follow
and
the
postage
is
free!!
Selling
my
phone
couldn't
be
easier.
Overall
very
satisfied.
Its
nice
to
order
from
a
company
that
knows
customer
service.
I
ordered
a
batch
of
USB's
with
my
organisation's
logo
and
they
were
delivered
within
days.
On
submitting
my
initial
query
I
was
promptly
contacted
and
a
sample
kit
was
delivered
within
24
hours.
On
providing
them
with
our
logo
their
designer
got
back
to
us
with
some
examples
of
how
it
would
look.
We
selected
our
preferred
model
and
color,
and
it
was
delivered
in
a
couple
of
days.
No
dramas.
Can't
fault
them
at
all,
if
you
have
worries
about
ordering
clothes
without
being
able
to
try
them
on
first
then
don't.
I
ordered
a
suit
which
i
thought
would
fit
(it
didn't)
and
returned
it
with
no
fuss
for
a
different
size.
fast
delivery
and
good
prices.
What's
not
to
like?
Every
time
I
come

web
site,
I
am
seeking
information
about
products
that
I
hope
will
improve
my
experience
as
a
a
photographer.

I
find
the
information
provided
to
be
comprehensive,
understandable,
and
helpful,
and
they've
led
me
to
purchase
decisions
that
I
haven't
regretted
-
both
in
products
I've
chosen
to
purchase,
and
in
products
that
I've
decided
were
not
right
for
me.
My
purchase
was
a
small
one
but
was
promptly
handled.

The
product
was
accurately
described
on
the
Web
page.
Our
dog

an
acute

right

VetRXDirect

us
the
best

and
a
quick,
painless
delivery
to
our
home
in
Chicago.

We'll
use
them
again!

it
in

It
was

At

I've
met
with

I
haven't
experienced
before

any
other

and

due
to

as
I've

after

I

it

just

I

They
are
trustworthy,
honest,

efficient.
They

and
are
always
willing

I
recently
placed
a
very
large
order
and
had
to
cancel
it
and
they
gladly
did
and
promptly
refunded
my
money
without
any
problems.
The
website
was
easy
to
manage
and
they
offered
a
great
selection.
I
would
definitely
use
them
again
for
future
purchases.
They
offered
the
same
items
as
Auto

and
it
was
half
the
price
and
shipping
was
cheaper.

The
condition
was
just
a

worse
than
described
when
purchasing.
It
did
not
detract
from
the
use
of
the

it
just
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
upon

I
always
look
on
trip
advisor
before
travelling.
Even
if
its
just
for
a
day
out.
The
restaurant
and
pub
reviews
are
great
too.
I've
been
to
few
places
'on
spec'
when
I've
been
out
and
about
and
regretted
it.
Reading
the
reviews
after
the
event
just
confirmed
why
trip
advisor
should
always
be
read
before
hand!
Excellent
prices,
products
as
described
and
delivery
earlier
than
expected.
I
would
have
given
five
stars
if
the
part
had
not
arrived
in
a
damaged
box
but
it
appears
to
be
OK
I
have
not
had
a
chance
to
install
part
yet
so
I
cannot
give
a
full
review
at
this
time.

I
love
the
ten
dollar
mall.
The
only
problem
I
have
is
sometimes
the
sleeves
run
short
or
pants
run
short.
So
I
don't
return
it,
I
just
give
them
away.
I'd
like
for
yem

I'll

On

up

I
found
them
while
researching
parts
suppliers
for
my
total
restoration
of
a
1987
VW
Westfalia
Syncro.
They
have
an
unbelievable
selection
of
parts
that
I
couldn't
find
anywhere
else.
The
prices
I've
paid
are
very
reasonable
and
their
shipping
couldn't
be
quicker.
Add
to
that
the
frequent
discount
coupons
that
they've
emailed
me
and
they
are
now
the
first
place
I
turn
to
when
I
work
on
any
of
my
vehicles
from
a
regular
Honda
to
my
Unimog.
Solid
company!
Great
product.
Install
and
let
it
do
it's
job.
How
easy
is
that?
So
quick.
So

I

no

a
friend
of
mine
told
me
of
this
site
that
sells
cheep
ink
for
pinters
and
said
give
it
a
try
so
with
a
wink
and
sip
of
my
pint
i
said
ye
no
probs
so
a
few
days
later
i
was
stuck
run
out
of
ink
and
not
a
lot
of
cash
in
the
bank
so
i
decided
to
treck
the
net
for
this
site
and
i
found
it
its
called
3000
rpm
so
i
looked
found
my
ink
still
price
was
to
much
then
i
notice
compatible
ink
for
a
fraction
of
the
price
and
thought
well
give
it
a
go
and
i
bought
5
full
sets
of
4
inks
for
just
under
half
the
price
i
would
pay
for
original
set
of
inks
and
i
have
been
buying
ever
since
so
if
i
was
you
i
would
have
a
go
it
wont
hurt
i
promise
you
i
was
looking
for
a
drill
so
i
typed
in
the

to

and
after
looking
ata
few
sites
i
found
buyaparcel.com
so
i
had
a
look
on
their
and
found
the
dril
i
was
looking
for
cheaper
than
any
where
else
then
a
few
days
later
i
went
back
to
that
site
and
bought
again
cheaper
than
any

Have

On
this

I

direct
from

with

Order
very
quickly
delivered
in
perfect
condition
what
more
is
there
to
say.
Had
some
things
sent
out
to
Italy.
Arrived
quickly
with
good
comunication.
Shopto
is
great
for
buying
computer/videogames,
especially
new
releases.
They
do
not
always
have
the
absolute
cheapest
prices
(though
sometimes
they
do),
but
as
long
as
you
order
before
5pm
you
can
be
sure
to
get
your
item
the
next
day.
And
they
will
email
and
text
you
to
give
you
a
timeslot
as
to
when
the
item
will
actually
arrive!
When
I
am
excited
about
a
new
game
being
released,
I
preorder
it
from
Shopto
as
I'm
guaranteed
to
actually
receive
it
on
release
day,
whether
I
order
it
months
before
or
at
4:55pm
on
the
day
before.
Easy
to
use
site
but
there
are
no
contact
details
for
Hostelworld
and
hard
to
find
out
what
to
do
when
something
goes
wrong.
For
all
your
CB
needs
this
is
an
excellent
resource.
Helpful
service
and
the
parts
and
equipment
were
received
on
time!
I
ordered
the
part
and
really
expected
I
would
get
a
great
part.

It
was
what
I
expected.

Thanks
Great
buying
experience.

I
plan
to
buy
from
West
Coast
Shaving
again.

The
clippers
work
great
and
look
nice.
Was
kept
in
the
loop
the
whole
process,
from
design
to
sample
patch
to
production.

Product
came
out
great,
delivered
well
before
expected
ship
date.

Would
order
from
these
guys
again
ordered
a
part
for
half
the
cost
of
that
from
O'reiley's.
Estimated
arrival
for
a
week
later,
and
arrived
within
3
days.
My
order
is
showing
as
being
despatched

they
have
not
arrived

over
a

A
good,

with
competent,
friendly

you
need
the
human
element

I
did
when
I
botched
a
booking.
Very
good
price
&
easy
to
install.
Works
just
as
good
as
others
costing
twice
as
much
at
other
sites
and
local
stores.
Thumbs
up
!!!
its
amazing
how
many
things
they
sell
for
my
car(toyota
celicaGT)
always
going
to
come
here
to
order
original
pieces
for
my
car
Very
nice
hostel,
far
from
the
party
places
but
near
to
the
bus
station.
Very
nice
rooms
with
good
beds
however
the
rooms
are
very
hot.

There
is
a
ceiling
fan
which
doesn't
blow
that
much
and
no
free
air
conditioning
(they
charge
and
it's
not
cheap).
Bathrooms
needed
to
be
cleaned
a
little
more
but
the
hostel
is
ok
I
managed
to
secure
a
copy
of

collectors
edition
late
on
in

pre
orders,
i
was
kept
well
informed
of
my
delivery
status
and
it
turned
up
on
the
day
of
release.
great
job
all
round,
will
very
happily
use
them
again.
Received
a
quote
and
because
of
short
notice
did
not
shop
around.
Proceeded
to
enter
all
details
only
to
find
that
having
done
all
this
the
actual
cost
was
over
10%
more
than
quoted.

The
choice
you
have
is
either
pay
the
extra
or
go
back
to
the
start.

Angry
-
this
is
what
I
did
and
managed
to
knock
off
the
late
cancellation
charge.
However
the
other
hidden
charge
-
the
booking
fee
-
is
not
an
option
and
has
to
be
paid
SO
WHY
ISN'T
IT
INCLUDED
IN
THE
QUOTE.
I
saved
about
$100
on
a
new
radiator
and
got
it
within
3
days.
Especially
pleased
Marcie's

Cudos!!!!

I

Look,
Bud,
I'd
like
to
be
able
to
at
least
try
ID
Vault,
PrivacyProtect,
and
ZoneAlarm,
but
I
can't
because
you
don't
offer
Mac-compatible
software.

I
shouldn't
have
to
waste
my
time
writing
this,
because
you
should
already
know
that
a
lot
of
people
run
Macs.

By
not
offering
Mac-compatible
software,
are
you
implicitly
stating
that
a
Mac
computer
doesn't
need
it,
and
so
Mac
computers
are
superior
to
PCs
when
it
comes
to
protection?

Whatever
the
case
may
be,
I'm
not
happy
about
paying
for
services
I
can't
use
or
spending
the
time
to
tell
you
so,
and
it's
too
bad
that
your
QC
department
is
so
small
that
it
has
to
rely
on
"squeaky
wheels"
to
find
out
how
to
improve
your
product
in
this
area.
I
have
had
nothing
but
good
come
from
doing
business
with
this
company,
I'm
truly
glad
we
found
each
other.
Yeah,
I
went
into
a
search
engine
looking
for
a
place
to
store
my
motorhome,
one
that
had
security
and
a
camera
system.
After
I
entered
my
request,
the
next
thing
I
knew
was
that
there
were
so
many
units
for
rent,
but
none
compareable
to
the
one
I
found.
It
was
so
easy,
I
was
even
able
to
secure
the
one
I
wanted
right
there
and
then,
one
word
"Remarkable".
And
so
easy.
Really
liked
the
simplicity
of
using
my
B&H
rewards
code
and
pin
to
pick
up
a
few
accessories.
i
looked
round
for
a
company
so
i
could
send
money
to
thailand
and
found
the
best
one,they
have
a
good
prompt
service
and
excellent
rates
for
sending
money
abroad,
When
I
order
a
part
I
expect
it
to
be
exactly
like
described
and
I
want
it
ASAP!
We'll
that's
exsactly
what
I
got.
A
great
product
and
had
it
the
next
day.
No
hassle
no
problems.
Can't
thank
you
enough.
Will
be
back
for
more.
The
purchase
of
my
1998
35'
Cabo
Flybridge
was
the
first
time
I
worked
with
a
boat
broker.
My
initial
impression
of
brokers
was
that
there
was
no
need
for
them
as
they
were
just
more
hands
in
the
kitchen.
After
working
with
Scott
E.
from
POP
Yachts,
I
have
to
say
that
impression
has
since
changed.
During
the
negotiation
process,
Scott
went
out
of
his
way
to
make
sure
he
completely
understood
my
conditions
(and
also
helped
me
understand
what
I
actually
wanted).
There
was
a
point
where
the
seller
and
I
could
not
agree
on
the
performance
of
one
of
the
boat's
systems;
Scott
went
as
far
to
call
up
the
manufacturer
and
get
the
specs
to
determine
if
the
system
was
properly
operating.
He
conferenced
me
into
the
call
and
the
3
of
us
worked
out
the
issue
within
minutes!
Ultimately
I
was
very
impressed
with
Scott's
care
and
concern
for
his
clients
and
it
certainly
shows
in
his
work.
There's
a
good
chance
if
Scott
didn't
represent
me
in
this
transaction,
I
may
not
be
the
proud
owner
of
a
35'
Cabo!
Thanks
Scott!

a
small
part
for
a
shower
on
two
occasions
and
I
have
been
easily
able
to
locate
the
part
online
and
it
has
arrived
quickly
enabling
me
to
do
a
good
service
for
my
customer.
The
service
provide
by
Luggage
Forward
was
great.

As
anyone
who
traveled
when
you
have
more
than
2
pieces
of
Luggage
plus
carry
on
items
it
can
be
quite
a
chore
to
mange
them.

I
found
that
this
service
provides
great
service
&
our
luggage
was
at
our
cabin
door
when
we
boarded.

It
makes
traveling
a
lot
easier.
I
had
a
minor
problem
with
one
of
my
reservations
and
they
were
prompt
in
responding
to
my
emails
and
resolving
the
issue.
I
ordered
a
t-shirt
in
size
medium,
yet
a
size
medium
box
was
delivered
with
an
extra
large
t-shirt
inside.
I
emailed
saying
the
item
was
incorrect
and
will
send
back
and
was
contacted
within
24
hours
apologising
and
that
a
new
item
would
be
sent
in
the
correct
size.
I
would
have
thought
that
the
correct
item
would
be
sent
to
arrive
asap,
I'm
still
yet
to
receive
it.
Not
the
greatest
experience.

We
were
looking
for
a
new
fridge-freezer
and
washing
machine
and
got
both
of
these
from
Appliances
Online.
I
hadn't
heard
of
them
before
but
their
website
was
much
more
informative
than
others
I
had
looked
at.
Their
delivery
options
were
great
and
the
check
out
process
was
very
easy.
Would
definitely
use
them
again
and
would
recommend.
I
found
the
web
site
very
easily
allowed
me
to
compare
many
different
tires.
My
purchase
(EOS
600D
&
18-55mm
lens)
arrived
as
predicted,
and
I
was
impressed
with
the
speed
and
price.
Your
carriers
emailed
me
with
the
time,
within
an
hour,
when
they
were
going
to
deliver.
They
too
deserve
compliments.

I'm
in

right
now
and
I'm
moving

I
needed
a
place
to
keep
my
things
for
the
moment
and
SpareFoot
put
me
in
touch
with
a
really
reputable
storage
facility.
I
even
had
to
change
my
reservation
date
at
the
last
minute
and
SpareFoot
allowed
me
to
do
that
without
any
hassles.
If
I
need
any
storage
in
the
future
I'll
be
using
SpareFoot.

everything
was
as

Polite
staff
and
reasonable
service
I
had
a
requirement
that
our
usual
IT
supplier
could
not
fulfil
so
I
shopped
around
on-line
and
came
across
Comms

The
quoted
price
was
the
cheapest
I
could
find,
with
free

Part

as
guaranteed,
so
my
only
experience
of
this
Company
is
first
class.
I
wanted
20
minatures
for
a
funeral
and
put
in
an
order
not
knowing
how
fast
they
would
be
delivered.
I
need
not
have
worried,
they
arrived
in
plenty
of
time
for
the
wake.
The
staff
at
Heinnies
are
kind
and
helpful.
Ordered
them
one
day
and
got
them
the
next.
What
more
can
i
say

-
keep
up
the
good
work!
I've
used
this
service
a
few
times,
and
generally
they
are
quite
good.
However
on
a
couple
of
occasions,
the
orders
have
turned
up
after
3
weeks,
and
sometimes
not
even
at
all.
I
found
the

light

for
my
volvo
which
I
could

The

on

enthusiastic

the

fine
enough.
The
inclusion

well

and
allowed
to
me
to
ensure
I
received
my
item
despite

I
basically

found
this

Seamless.
B&H
always
delivers
a
great
product,
fair
price,
and
on
schedule.
Shopping
with
B&H
is
an
enjoyable
experience
because
I
can
find
what
I
need
quickly,
and
they
have
a
massive
inventory
-
so
even
hard
to
find

are
in

....Luv
this

Very
satisfied
with
both
response
and
response
time.
This
is
the
worst
merchandise/purchase
I
ever
made.
I
ordered
a
pair
of
Ray
Ban
prescription
sunglasses
about
three
weeks
ago
from
smartbuyglasses.com,
it
took
them
that
long
to
complete
my
order.
So
guess
what?
The
14
day
return
policy
that
they
have
is
NO
good
because
they
take
over
14
days
to
send
the
order.
When
I
finally
got
my
order
the
shades
were
in
separate
plastic
bags.
So
I'm
thinking
there
has
to
be
an
instruction
manual
on
how
to
attach
my
shades
to
my
prescription
glasses,
but
there
wasn't.
So
I
sent
them
an
email
asking
for
instructions
and
this
is
there
original
email
response:
Good
service,
No
problems
everything
arrived
on
time.
I've
now
been
using
Physio
Supplies
for
about
3
years
now
for
the
supplies
of
equipment
that
I
use
myself
and
with
my
clients.
Aside
from
that,
I
had
a
problem
with
a
previous
order
when
I
found
a
cord
to
be
malfunctioning.
B&H
replaced
the
cord
and
did
not
even
request
I
send
the
previous
one
back
saving
us
both
time
and
money.
Thanks
B&H.
When
time
is
money,
speed,
quality

and
customer
service
matters.

Town

3.
I
have
always
been
happy
with
Chewy.
Com
--
so
have
my
dogs!
I
ordered
a
part
for
my
electric
shower,
but
when
it
arrived
it
was
the
wrong
part
-
my
fault.
I
reordered
the
right
part
and
returned
the
incorrect
part.
The
correct
part
arrrived
and
I
received
a
refund
on
the
incorrect
one.
This
all
happped
in
about
a
week.
Clearly
a
very
efficient
and
prompt
service.
Excellant.
I
have
ordered
from
DRIS
several
times
and
always
been
given
great
service.
The
customer
service
has
been
excellent.
Shipping
has
always
been
handled
quick
and
efficiently

Great

Booking
a
trip
from
Boston
to
San
Francisco,
I
entered
18
March
for
departure
date
instead
of
18
April
way
back
in
November
and
realized
my
mistake
a
few
days
later.

After
several
phone
calls
to
Travelocity
and
spending
hours
on
the
phone
and
being
transferred
from
one
to
the
other,
all
they
could
do
was
get
me
a
$100
refund
on
800
dollars
worth
of
tickets....


I
expected
better
as
a
regular
user
of
Travelocity
the
only
thing
wrong
is
slow
shipping....but
had
the
parts
i
needed
at
a
good
price.
Upon
arriving
at
the
storage
unit,
I
was
amazed
not
only
by
the
professionalism
of
the
staff;
but,
also
the
cleanliness
of
the
facilty.
The
lawn
eas
well
maintained
and
the
trees
and
flowering
gave
you
a
sence
of
peace.
The
storage
unit
was
so
clean
and
maintained
that
you
would
have
taught
this
was
a
new
storage
facilty.
Upon
leaving
I
could
not
get
over
how
hospitable
the
employees
were
and
felt
confident
that
my
belongings
were
safe
from
not
only
theft;
but
also,
any
type
of
inclimate
weather.
I
would
recommend
this
storage
facilty
to
all
people
needing
a
storage
unit.
This
place
left
me
truly
amazed
in
each
and
every
way
imaginable.
I
sent
my
close
friend
and
ex-girlfriend
a
bouquet
of
your
flowers,
the
strawberry
sundae
variety.

She
loves
pink,
I
think
she
enjoyed
receiving
them
for
Valentine's
Day!
I
recently
bought
a
Berghaus
rucksack
from
the
Outdoor
Shop.
It
was
the
cheapest
I
could
find
anywhere
and
was
delivered
just
two
days
after
ordering.
Couldn't
really
ask
for
more!
I've
been
looking
for
a
way
to
sharpen
drills
without
buying
an
expensive
electric
machine.
Tooled-Up
sell
the
Draper
drill
stand
which
allows
me
to
use
my
own
grinder
and
accurately
sharpen
all
my
drills.
Easy
to
find,
easy
to
buy
and
a
sharp
delivery,
too.
Over
two
years,
e-magnets
have
outperformed
the
others,
and
above
all,
they
have
been
ultimately
helpful
with
my
inquiries.
I
needed
to
learn
about
the
magnetic
field
as
well
as
the
best
shapes
for
my
new
product
development.
Each
product
uses
two
ring
magnets
and
the
first
ten
units
will
be
sent
to
the
US
customer
in
July
for
trials.
E-magnets
made
it
easy
for
me.
I
ordered
most
my
camera
stuff
on
B&H
and
that
really
saved
me
lots
of
time.
I
trusted
their
quality
and
can
find
things
that
is
hard
to
find
like
the
120
film.
Got
my
replacement
mirror
from
PartsGeek
and
it
arrived
quickly.

Price
was
great
compared
to
other
sites.
Great
prices
and
excellent
service.

They
now
carry
everything
I
use.

I
emailed
them
once
with
a
question
and
they
responded
quickly
and
professionally.
Easy
to
review
information
and
register
on
website.
Absolutely
fantastic.
Exceeded
our
expectations!
Extremely
high
quality
and
we
will
use
again.
I
went
in
for
an
alignment,
balance
and
rotation.
I
bought
my
tires
4years
ago
and
I
have
been
in
every
year
for
the
same
service.
Tires
are
still
in
very
good
condition.
I
do
about
8
to
10
thousand
miles
per
year.
Great
service.
Only
a
40
minute
wait.
I
was
a
little
skeptical
about
how
this
would
work
out-
delivery
of
a
30+
pound
bag
of
dogfood-
every
2
weeks.

So
far,
my
expectations
have
been
exceeded
and
there
have
been
no
issues.

I
also
just
signed
up
for
the
monthly
spoiled
me
rotten
program
too.

PetFlow
really
seems
to
be
onto
something
here
and
their
customer
service
so
far
has
been
top-notch.

I've
recommended
them
to
all
my
friends
and
family
and
will
likely
be
a
customer
for
life.
Received
sales
pack
the
next
day,
all
the
forms
were
filled
out
so
I
just
had
to
sign
and
post
the
phone
off.
They
received
this
within
two
days
and
payment
was
made
the
following
day.
really
impressed
and
relieved
that
there
was
no
haggling
over
the
phone
condition
etc.
Really
good
service!
so
easy
,
just
a
few
clicks
,
next
day
goods
sat
on
my
desk,
I
bought
a
beautiful
Eames
inspired
chair
and
ottoman
set
which
was
slightly
damaged.

The
set
was
replaced
without
question.

Marilyn
of
Interior
Icons
provided
personal,
considerate
and
efficient
customer
care
throughout.
The
Items
were
exactly
what
I
needed,
installed
easily,
and
arrived
promptly!!
Very
quick
delivery
-
ordered
late
on
a
saturday
night
and
had
it
by
tuesday.
Fantastic
value,
cheaper
than
any
other
website
I
could
find
by
a
significant
amount.
Once
again,
Parts
Geek
beat
out
the
rest,
they
are
the
best.
I
received
my
rotors
in
less
time
than
expected.
This
was
a
really
quick
and
easy
to
navigate
site.

Uncomplicated,
easy
to
read
and
with
helpful
explanations.

Best
of
all
-
great
value
too!
I
have
been
delighted
with
the
service
from
bOnline.
Jono
Breen
was
extremely
helpful
and
proficient
in
assisting
my
initial
set
up
and
getting
me
started.
The
support
has
been
very
useful
and
swift
and
I
have
received
several
follow-up
emails
to
make
sure
that
everything
is
to
my
satisfaction.
I
am
impressed
with
how
user-friendly
the
set-up
was
and
I
would
recommend
bOnline
to
anyone.
Thank
you.
Couldn't
ask
for
a
better
service,
ordered
goods
and

2
days
later
had
arrived,
would
certainly
recommend
them,
will
order
again.
Thanks
very
much.
Have
used
The
Whisky
Exchange
quite
a
few
times,
never
had
a
problem,
always
very
prompt
deliveries,
very
well
packed,
and
competitively
priced.
I
booked
to
send
two
gifts
to
my
friends
in
cinci...
They
collected
at
2ish
and
said
they
would
be
delivered
the
next
day.....
And
they
were!!!
I
am
ecsatic.
Could
not
fault
the
service
I've
used
Blackcircles
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
the
past
-
the
prices
have
(nearly)
always
been
the
best
and
the
fitting
quick
and
convenient
-
his
is
an
on-line
service
that
really
can
be
trusted
to
come
up
with
the
goods!
I
highly
recommend
parts
geek
because
their
prices
are
great
and
the
items
are
exactly(even
better)
than
advertised.
I
would
recommend
Parts
Geek
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
parts.
They
have
very
fast
delivery
and
the
prices
are
right.
Very
happy!

Customer
Service
was
outstanding,
very
polite
and
helpful.

I
will
definitely
buy
glasses
from
FramesDirect
again.

Thank
you
:)
Very
happy
period
The

and
cheep.

parts,
imagine
that!
Great
company
to
do
business
with.
Slow
shipping
but
it
came
in
when
they
said
it
would!!!
First
delivery
was
very
fast,
before
expected.

Second
delivery
was
delayed
do
to
the
holiday
but
was
tracked
the
whole
time.
I
will
do
more
buisness
with
partsgeek.

Thanks
Good
service,
good
price.
Will
use
again,
as
long
as
I
remember
my
password!
Ordered
an
oil
pan
gasket
for
my
wife's
car.
Part
showed
up
in
four
days,
and
fit
perfectly.
This
was
my
first
purchase
from
Partsgeek,
but
won't
hesitate
to
buy
from
them
again.
I
get
my
parts
form
local
stores.

Most
of
the
time
they
have
to
order
them,
and
the
cost
is
more
then
I
would
like
to
pay.


I
was
recomend
to
greekparts.


I'm
glad
I
was.

Exact
part
and
cheeper.
I
found
the
site
easy
to
use
and
the
prices
were
competitive.
My
order
was
here
in
3
days.


I
highly
recomend
this
site
to
others.
I
have
purchased
from
this
store
in
the
past
and
had
good
service.
No
problems
yet,
so
I
am
not
sure
if
something
was
bad
with
some
equipment
that
I
would
have
trouble
sending
it
back.....but
others
have
good
words
to
say
about
returns.
I
can't
believe
how
many
calls
I
got
related
to
my
tiny
order.

Had
anything
gone
wrong
(which
it
didnt)
there
would
have
been
someone
calling
me
before
I
would
even
be
aware.


Great
customer
service.
Cheaper
than
the
high
street
optitons
and
you
don't
have
to
agree
a
monthly
subscription,
my
contact
lenses
were
dispatched
the
same
day,
great
service
and
I
will
use
again
Products
first
class
but
pins
on
current
Davey
rigging
screws
and
toggles
are
not
the
same
size
as
my
75
year
old
ones
so
I
returned
2
toggles
for
reimbursement.
No
problem

Laura.
I
don't
drive
many
miles
since
I
retired
11
years
ago
so
this
is
only
the
second
set
of
tyres
I've
had
fitted
in
5
years.
I
used
Blackcircles
last
time
for
an
identical
order
and
the
total
price
has
risen
only
£1-76
!!!
Having
rented
a
flat

in
Spain
for
6
winter
months
I
wanted
to
be
able
to
pay
monthly
on
the
Internet.
I
had
two
problems
with
my
UK
bank.
Although
tyre
centre
was
very
busy
they
fitted
my
tyres
within
20
minutes,
waiting
room
was
excellent
with
TV
and
Coffee
facilities
even
free
WIFI.
Couldn't
have
been
happier
will
certainly
use
Blackcircles
again.
Try
them
yourself
you
will
be
impressed.
We
orginally
bought
our
raspberry
pi
from
MCM
and
now
they
have
everything
for
this
unit
and
at
great
prices.
We
always
check
back
to
see
what
is
available
for
our
Pi.
I
was
very
pleased
to
get
my
books
on

when
I
had
ordered
so
late.
would
be
great
if
they
would
have
sent
the
part
I
ordered!
I
had
a
need
for
an
odd
size
filter,
this
company
offers
a
variety
of
odd
sizes.
In
order
to
make
up
my
size
they
toof
2
standard
length
filters
and
basically
cut
the
edge
off
of
one
to
make
the
correct
size
width.
The
added
a
card
board
strip
in
secure
the
two
together.
It
didn't
work.

Couple
that
with
the
filter
being
sent
in
a
too
large
box
that
was
crushed
in
transit
.
The
result
a
filter
that
had
no
rigidity,
would
have
got
sucked
right
in
to
the
intake.
On
a
positive
note
they
were
quick
to
refund
my
money
with
a
picture
of
the
defective
filter.
I
like

Travelling
from
Australia
to
Hawaii
we
needed
to
hire
cars
at
5
locations,
we
booked
through
DriveAway
Holidays
Australia
for
all
5.
The
great
thing
is
it
includes
all
the
different
insurances
that
are
required
in
the
USA
which
is
confusing
and
expensive
when
you
are
at
the
hire
car
counter
and
if
you
don`t
have
these
insurances
your
travel
insurance
doesn`t
always
cover
the
car
hire
excess
etc.
We
also
liked
the
fact
we
paid
in
australian
dollars
and
found
the
rates
extremely
good.
On
four
of
our
hires
we
were
upgraded
at
the
counter
free
of
charge
from
a
compact
car
to
something
larger
as
they
seem
to
"look
after"
their
corperate
customers
which
is
what
this
rate
seems
to
be.
The
only
negative
was
we
hired
with
Dollar
on
three
occasions
and
at
one
location
had
a
major
issue
which
cost
us
a
few
hours
of
our
valueable
holiday
time
but
that
is
not
DriveAway
Holidays
fault
I
would
just
advise
anyone
else
booking
in
the
USA
to
use
Avis
or
Hertz
through
the
driveaway
website
even
if
it`s
a
bit
more
expensive,
this
particular
dollar
location
did
not
like
the
rate
we
were
given
and
that
it
had
included
the
insurance
and
GPS
they
seemed
to
want
to
make
more
money
from
us.
Overall
though
we
had
an
excellent
experience
using
Driveaway
Holidays
Australia.
With
various
ways
of
identifying
the
tyres
you
need,
Tyre
Shooper
provides
a
quick,
easy
route
to
tyre
selection.

Once
selected
it
is
straight
forward
to
book
your
appointment
at
a
local
garage
to
have
them
fitted
at
a
time
convenient
to
you.

The
selection
of
tyres
on
offer
is
excellent
and
the
price
all
inclusive
and
very
competitive.
Price
and
selection
are
very

good
though
the
price
is
marred
a
little
by
expensive
postage
charges.
Leaves
a
slightly
sour
taste
in
the
mouth
at
the
end.
Only
minor
gripe
was
that
I
was
given
conflicting
advice
on
a
recommendation
on
a
regulator
as
compared
to
my
girlfriend.

I
had
purchased
the
regulator
(but
it
had
not
been
despatched)
and
wanted
to
determine
whether
I
had
made
a
sensible
choice
(customer
care
was
not
open
on
the
day
of
purchase,
hence
the
post-purchase
check).

I
was
advised
that
the
one
I
had
purchased
was
the
recommended
one
in
that
price
bracket
but
when
my
girlfriend
asked
the
same
question
-
having
not
bought
anything
-
she
was
given
a
different
answer.

The
impression
left
was
that
maybe
I
was
advised
in
such
a
manner
as
to
avoid
the
hassle
of
my
changing
my
order.

I
would
accept,
however,
that
more
than
one
recommendation
could
be
made
and
I
was
possibly
advised
appropriately.
I
came
to
B&H
because
my
son
recommended
it.

B&H
beat
Nikon's
price
for
the
product
I
wanted.
It
was
easy
to
find

and
easy
to
make
the
purchase.
Had
to
go
to
the
new
warehouse
at
Martland
Park,
Wigan,
to
buy
some
lights.

Staff
were
excellent
and
opened
up
especially
for
us
as
they
had
not
quiet
finished
the
opening
displays.

Served
us
without
any
problems.

Can't
wait
for
christmas
to
set
up
the
lights.

Everything
we
wanted
we
got
in
the
one
place.
Very
helpful
staff
@Leigh.

Got
what
I
wanted
quickly
and
efficiently.
Hi
there:
Ok
I
placed
an
order
a
few
days
ago
and
tried
to
price
match
one
of
my
products
to
another
site
and
at
the
beginning
of
my
order
they
gave
me
the
5%
less
as
advertised.
But
then
I
got
an
email
saying
that
the
site
that
I
found
with
the
lower
price
wasn’t
eligible
because
of
the
way
they
do
their
shipping.
Then
the
next
day
I
got
an
email
saying
my
order
was
canceled
due
to
a
credit
card
issue.
The
credit
card
thing
was
probably
my
fault
(fat
fingers).
However,
I
just
resubmitted
my
order
and
did
a
side
by
side
comparison
to
bodybuilding.com
and
even
with
a
10%
coupon
my
price
was
25$
less
with
SW.
I
had
heard
some
bad
review
but
opted
to
try
them
anyway.
It
all
worked
out
fine,
delivery
was
good
and
the
food
was
right
on
the
mark.
The
delivery
guy
is
a
very
nice
man
with
a
moustache
who
always
makes
me
feel
happy
that
I
ordered
from
there,
not
like
I
am
too
lazy
to
go
to
the
store
a
block
away.
He
is
cheerful
and
polite,
and
very
prompt.
I
am
always
surprised
at
the
speed
of
delivery.

Now

with
the

professionalism
of
the

the
quality
of
the

the

and
the

The

B&H
will
have
them
at

It
was
quick
and
easy
to
use.
Very
nice,
courteous,
always
have
what
we
need.
Excellent
prices,
easy

Good
selection,
but
hoping
to
see
more
of
the
San

I
use
in
the
future.
All
the
San

I
was
looking
for
are
now
there.

Quick

similar

offered
by
my
MasterCard

This
site
has
everything
you
would
need
supplement
wise.
You
cant
find
a
better
price
because
they
will
match
it
and
then
beat
the
price
from
another
website.
Along
with
that
the
closeout
sales
and
free
samples
are
unmatched
by
any
other
site
I
have
ever
seen.
Great

We

look
forward
to
continuing
our
relationship
with
their
company.
I
ordered

a
powered
right
mirror
for
my
car
for
a
low
price.
The
mirror
looks
exactly
like
the
original
and
works
fine!
This
was
a
good
deal,
and
I
will
certainly
order
again
from
PartsGeek.
I
bought
two
stainless
steel
food/water
bowls
from
Basis
Pet
and
I'm
very
happy
with
the
quality.
You
can't
really
tell
from
the
photos
but
the
bowls
are
heavy
grade
and
thicker
on
the
bottom
so
they
sit
well
and
are
solid.
They
don't
look
or
feel
cheap
like
some
other
metal
bowls
you
may
see
in
the
pet
store
and
it's
good
to
know
Basis
Pet
is
dedicated
to
a
quality
made,
safe,
US
made
product.
Got
my
order
real
quick
which
was
very
nice
when
your
car
needs
that
part
right
away.
We
received
two
large
deer
antler
chews
from
Chewy.
The
response
was
great,
our
order
arrived
within
4
days
of
purchase.
The
dog
has
been
so
happy
he
just
sits
around
chewing
all
day.
We
actually
had
a
doggy
house
guest
who
has
been
chewing
on
the
second,
and
she
normally
doesn't
play
with
toys.
Great
experience,
will
definitely
buy
again.
The
item
I
ordered
was
the
correct
part,
unlike
when
I
have
ordered
from
other
sites,
and
it
shipped
very
quickly.

It
was
easy
to
install
and
I
will
continue
to
use
Parts

because
of
their
great

great

on

My

using
this
company
was
very
easy
and
painless
and
the
products
worked
well

Love

Global
Airport
Parking.

Their
website
is
very
easy
to
use,
has
a
good
selection
of
parking
lots
and
garages,
has
an
easy
check
out

process,
really
makes
traveling
easy,
and
takes
one
part
of
the
inevitable
headache
that
comes
with
traveling
easy.

I
really
appreciate
the
option
to
round
up
my
total
to
give
a
donation
to
a
charity.
I'd
read
a
couple
reviews
that
mentioned
a
couple
problems
with
this
part-
threaded
pegs
with
no
nuts
as
opposed
to
the
threaded
hole
on
the
original,
and,
incompatable
connector
that
had
to
be
re-wired
to
work.
And
then,
the
part
showed
up
in
a
banged
up
box
that
I
took
pictures
of
in
case
the
part
was
damaged.
Everything
worked
out
fine.
The
part
fit
perfect
and
plugged
right
in
and
I'm
very
happy
with
the
experience.

A
company
that
did
what
we
couldn't
do
for
the
longest
time.
Trying
to
fill
in
all
those
tricky
forms
led
us
to
multiple
form
filling
and
still
no
hope
anywhere.
After
browsing
thru
many
company's
and
looking
at
their
credentials
some
how
our
final
decision
was
to
hire
Legal
Force
which
made
our
life
so
easy
that
it's
beyond
our
imagination.
There
we
were
with
the
results
that
took
us
months
to
achieve.
We
are
so
happy
that
finally
our
happy
face
logo
got
it's
happiness.
Very
professional
and
efficient
with
great
customer
service.
Couldn't
have
asked
for
anything
better
than
that.
They
have
the
ability
to
turn
any
impossible
job
into
possible.
We
highly
recommend
them.
Lowest
prices
anywhere
and
fast
shipping!
Everything
about
this
company
is
pristine.
Products,

inventory,
specials,
customer
service,
EVERYTHING.
I
order
all
my

from

Always
will
and
highly

it.
If
you
get
a
chance
to
go
to
their
store
in
NYC,
it
is
AMAZING.
Recommend
that
too.

I
was
really
impressed
with
the
knowledge
&
flexibility
of
Joe
in
the
Billerica
shop.

After
scheduling
tires
based
on
my
own
research,
Joe
explained
that
the
tires
I
selected
were
really
designed
for
a
larger
vehicle.

He
then
helped
me
pick
out
a
more
appropriate
tire
that
he
had
in
stock.

I
initially
agreed
with
his
selection,
but
then
halfway
into
the
job,
changed
my
tire
selection
(after
more
on-line
research).

Joe
had
no
problem
stopping
the
job
mid-stream
and
rescheduling
based
on
my
new
selection.
That's
flexibility!

Joe
wasn't
kidding
when
he
said
"satisfaction
guaranteed"
Thanks
Joe!
I
have
no
problems
with
this
part.
A
perfect
match
Placed
an
order
with
GAK,
it
arrived
less
than
24
hours
later,
and
im
from
North
East
Scotland.
Not
only
was
the
delivery
the
fastest
i
have
experienced
ANYWHERE
but
the
customer
service
was
spot
on
(Thanks
Eddie).
The
response
to
my
queries
was
fast
and
hassle
free...
so
overall
GAK
in
my
eyes
is
a
very
friendly/reliable
company
due
to
the
good
people
who
work
there
and
not
forgetting
their
amazing
prices
and
deals.
I
really
enjoyed
my
experience
at
partsgeek.
The
price
was
perfect,
and
the
free
shipping
was
a
great
deal.
The
only
complaint
I
have
and
that
didn't
make
it
5
stars
is
that
I
never
got
a
confirmation
email
that
my
item
shipped
with
the
tracking
info.
That
left
me
wondering
for
a
couple
days
if
it
was
coming,
it
it'd
be
here
this
week,
next,
or
in
a
couple.
Fortunately
it
came
within
the
week.
I
would
still
highly
recommend
them
based
on
my
first
experience.
I
got
a
2
pairs
of
cool
glasses
that
I've
not
seen
in
the
usual
optician's
on
the
high
street.
Best
of
all,

they
have
different
colours
unlike
all
the
black
only
geek
style
frames
on
the
high
street.
Ive
had
many
items
from
Littlewoods
without
a
hitch.
This
time
i
ordered
a
galaxy
s3
mobile.
Guess
what?
Yodel
say
its
been
delivered
with
someone
elses
signature?
Not
got
no
phone
but
a
big
bill
to
remove.
They
say
it
will
take
up
to
21
days
to
investigate.
Drag
the
Yodel
driver
in
and
ask
him
to
show
where
he
delivered
it
to
and
who
signed
for
it
with
unknown
initials.
Product
damaged.
I
had
to
removed
a
part
from
the
old
unit
to
fix
inside
the
new
unit.
Packaging
need
to
be
much
better
to
protect
fragile
parts.
I
am
happy
with
the
service
and
speed
in
acquiring
the
product
I
bought.
Buying
parts
there
is
ok,
but
"stay
away"
from
the
service
department.
Seems
the
average
walking
the
street
atv
riders
is
smarter
than
their
mechanics.

I
cannot
beleive
the
crap
I
went
through
with
these
people.
I
especially
loved
the
two
hour
waits,
while
they
search
for
my
keys
when
I
came
to
pick
up
my
machine.

And
to
think
I
paid
for
this
special
service
and
treatment
in
the
form
of
an
extended
warranty.

BIG
MISTAKE!
I
will
recommend
this
company
to
anyone
needed
any
parts,

Thanks.
I
ordered
a
flower
arrangement
from
SerenataFlowers
for

my
wife
as
a
wedding
anniversary
gift.
The
arrangement
was
beautifully
presented
and
much
appreciated
by
my
wife.
I
first
used
Printer
Basics
as
I
was
unable
to
find
locally
the
cartridge
I
required.
The
service
is
easily
accessible
online,
the
delivery
time
is
excellent
and
the
cartridge
is
of
good
quality.
When
we
appointed

didn't
know
what
to

but
from

they
were
amazing.

it

Left
the

at

but
it
took
almost
two

Then
another
two

to

Having
said
that
I
would
use
the

again.
Ratings
can
be

The
representative
doesn't
seem
to
know
the
areas
where
hotels
are
located.
I
chose
shima

as
it
came
up
on
the
supplies
list
and
was
considerably
cheaper
than
some
of
the
others.
Sensibly
my
order
was
sent
by
post
so
I
did
not
have
to
sign
for
it.
Highly
recommended
speedy
informative
service,
sensibly
packed.
Great!
I
booked
a
two
night
trip
with
these
guys,
and
it
was
49.00
higher,
than
i
got
it
direct
from
the
hotel.
Call
direct
first,
save
money.
They

could
not
even
spell
my
name
right
!!!
I
thought
this
seemed
like
a
good
deal
and
it
was
until
I
got
my
clubs
back.
I
used
my
own
case
and
it
arrived
with
the
handle
broken
off.
I
emailed
ship
sticks
but
never
received
a
reply.
Obviously
they
don't
stand
behind
their
service.
Mechanical
failure
at
any
level
can
wreck
your
day.
Speedy
delivery
of
the
right
part
goes
a
long
way
to
ease
the
frustration.
Parts

I
was

to
get
a
replacement
for
a
tire
damaged
by
a
pothole
and
got

about
a

for

The

was
extremely
knowledgable

not
pushy
about

I
ordered
items
on
a
Weds
that
I
needed
by
Sat.

There
were
multiple
shipping
choices.

It
was
before
noon,
so
I
chose
2-day
shipping.

I
didn't
receive
a
confirmation
of
shipping
until
30
hours
later
and
noted
that
goods
would
not
arrive
until
Mon.

I
called
customer
service
who
basically
said
that
"technically
we
are
right
and
you
are
wrong."

Not
good
choice
of
words
in
that
situation.

I
wanted
to
cancel
order,
but
they
said
too
bad
that
goods
already
on
the
way
and
can't
stop
the
FedEx
machine.

I
looked
at
how
to
return
goods,
but
those
needed
a
form
to
be
attached
else
they
would
not
refund
all
money.

Since
items
are
gong
to
a
third
party's
address,
that
one
won't
work
either.

Overall,
a
bad
experience
in
trying
to
order
with
respect
to
a
timeline,
in
having
order
filled
and
shipped
in
timely
fashion,
and
in
getting
help
from
customer
service
to
find
a
solution.

I
won't
do
business
with
this
firm
EVER
again.

I
chose
2-day
shipping.
I
didn't
receive
a
confirmation
of
shipping
until
30
hours
later
and
noted
that
goods
would
not
arrive
until
Mon.
I
called
customer
service
who
basically
said
that
"technically
we
are
right
and
you
are
wrong."
Not
good
choice
of
words
in
that
situation.
I
wanted
to
cancel
order,
but
they
said
too
bad
that
goods
already
on
the
way
and
can't
stop
the
FedEx
machine.
I
looked
at
how
to
return
goods,
but
those
needed
a
form
to
be
attached
else
they
would
not
refund
all
money.
Since
items
are
gong
to
a
third
party's
address,
that
one
won't
work
either.
Overall,
a
bad
experience
in
trying
to
order
with
respect
to
a
timeline,
in
having
order
filled
and
shipped
in
timely
fashion,
and
in
getting
help
from
customer
service
to
find
a
solution.
I
won't
do
business
with
this
firm
EVER
again.

in
coming
up
with
an
idea
on
a
gift
for
my
daughter
and
son
in
law
that
reside
in
Arizona
until
my
wife
mentioned
sending
them
lobsters.
I
came
across
the
site

for
Maine
Lobsters
Now
and
placed
an
order.
The
lobsters
arrived
the
following
morning
at
11am
and
my
daughter
said
the
lobsters
were
full
of
life
and
as
tasty
a
lobster
as
she
as
ever
had.
She
said
it
was
one
of
the
best
gifts
that
she
could
have

She
said
the
only
thing
that
was
missing
was
the

in

But,
when

I

the

of
this

The
item
arrived
on
time,
all
seems
to
be
in
perfect
condition.
Is
has
not
been
possible
to
use
it
as
the
weather
has
been
too
cold,
plenty
of

Needed

Primarily
because
of
the
lower
cost,
I've
ordered
filters
from
Air
Filters
Direct
on
two
(2)
separate
occasions.

My
last
order
generated
a
telephone
call
from
an
employee
of
Air
Filters
Delivered
whereby
I
was
advised
that
my
latest
order
differed
from
my
order
of
over
one
(1)
year
ago.

That
call
both
saved
me
money
and
time
as
it
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
correct
an
error
I
had
made
before
the
order
was
mindlessly
filled.

That
was
truly
impressive
and
refreshing
when
considering
most
of
my
experiences
in
dealing
with
mail
order
organizations.


Such
attention
to
detail
seems
to
have
been
lost
in
today's
business
practices.

I
will
gladly
order
from
AFD
when
I
need
air
filters
in
the
future.

Highly
recommend
purchasing
filters
from
AFD.
This
was
a
good
experience
The
LCD

replacement
screen
for
my
Asus
laptop
saved
it
from

The
service
was
exemplary
and
the
product
so
far
exceeds
my
expectations.

I
look
forward
to
sharing
my
experience
with
any
of
my
colleagues
who
find
they
need
a
replacement
screen
for
any
PC-based
product.

I
ordered
two
rack
shelves,
a
2U
wall-mount
frame
and
three
patch
panels.
The
box
looked
OK
on
delivery,
but
evidently
had
been
dropped
as
one
of
the
mounting
ears
on
one
patch
panel
was
slightly
bent
(I
was
able
to
manually
straighten
it),
and
both
the
rack
shelves
had
sustained
damage
(scratches
and
one
shelf
bowed).
Not
enough
to
warrant
the
pain
of
returning
them,
but
annoying
nonetheless.

service.
I

ordered
a
set
of
speaker
covers
from
djkit
&
service
was
great
from
start
to
finish.
Very
pleased
with
this
delightful
gift
for
Mothers
day.
Great
customer
services,
swift
delivery.
The
brandy
was
a
gift
and
we
have
already
been
told
that
it
was
a
lovely
boxed
gift,
with
a
card
attached,
the
Brandy
was
superb!
Highly
recommended.
Great
concept,
horrible
company.
I
would
highly
reccommend
this
company
to
anyone.
Great
service
and
products.
Pre-delivery
service
was
efficient
and
courteous.

Product
was
as-ordered.

(Non-trivial
to
assemble
but
that's
another
matter).
Good
table,
easy
to
use
and
move
around.
Their
parts
fit
perfectly
and
were
a
good
price.
noting
to
say
except...brilliant.
Many
stores
sell
great
gear.

A
lot
of
them
have
great
pricing.


Some
offer
free
shipping.

B&H
is
all
of
these
reasons,
but
their
people
are
unbeatable.

Those
very
people
are
courteous,
knowledgable,
and
eager
to
please
their
customer.

What
else
can
a
customer
expect
from
a
business?

A
single

and
I
needed
a

Good

Imam
clueless
about
car
and
truck
repair.

I'm
on
a
budget
and
needed
a
replacement
mirror
for
my
GMC
Sonoma
truck.

I
found
it
here
and
orders
it.

The
price
was
much
lower
than
expected
and
it
arrived
very,
very
quickly.

I
could
not
be
more
pleased
with
the
service,
communication
and
product
in
my
dealings
with
PartsGeek.
My
experience
was
great
while
ordering,
the
prices
were
great,
free
shipping
was
a
real
plus.
The
customer
service
needs
some
work,
slow
response
time,
cannot
connect
when
I
call.
I
have
ordered
parts
for
various
vehicles
from
this
business.
They
have
always
sent
me
the
correct
parts
that
I
ordered.
The
delivery
time
was
also
quite
fast.
And
the
prices
are
very
good.
I
would
recommend
then
to
anyone
.
I
purchased
a
game
here
for
good
price.
Even
though
there
was
some
verification
problem
(perhaps
my
fault)
it
was
solver
in
quick
and
simple
manner.
I
bought
tablet
PIPO
M6
PRO
32GB.
Delivery
was
ok,
although
the
vat
tax
in
Netherlands
was
not
counted
in
so
I
had
to
pay
that
extra
(70
EUR)
when
it
went
through
customs
in
Netherlands.
I
ordered
a
case
but
it
had
opening
for
camera
on
the
wrong
side.
Golf18
provides
some
of
the
best
pricing
available.
Making
them
even
better

is
the

new
incentive
program
they
are
offering.

Also
their
website
is
uncluttered
and
simple
to
use.
Part
was
delivered
in
a
timely
fashion.

Price
was
cheaper
then
anywhere
else.

Well
something
went
wrong
with
my
order
and
one
phone
call
later
I
was
an
extremely
happy
customer.
It
is
always
a
pleasure
to
use
a
reliable
auto
parts
dealer
like
parts
geek
Prompt,
excellent
service
and
prices
but
sometimes
I
find
the
website
a
little
bit
of
a
maze.
That
said,
the
website
has
improved
since
I
first
used
it
and
I
am
sure
this
is
an
ongoing
development
of
the
ShopTo.Net
team!
The
delivery
was
quick
as
possible

the
transaction
was
easy

the
product
was
exactly
as
named


works
perfect

couldnt
be
anymore
satisfied,

i
will
defanetly
be
buying
from
you
again


count
on
it
:D
This
place
is
great.
It
has
quality
OEM
parts
that
beat
any
competion
in
price
and
overall
value.
They
deliver
quickly
and
stand
behind
their
product.
Look
to
PartsGeek
first
before
you
spend
that
hard
earned
cash
with
some
other
auto
parts
supplier.
You
will
be
glad
that
you
did.
You
guys
Rock!
This
is
my
second
order
from
Royalshave.

Good
service
and
products.

No
complaints.
I
placed
the
order
quick
and
easy.
It
helped
me
find
the
correct
parts
for
my
car
and
get
them
ordered.
read
the
catchy
phrase
I
grateful
for
the
service,
thanks
I
ordered
around
lunchtime
and
it
was
delivered
the
following
day
before
lunchtime
well
worth
£5
delivery
excellent
service.
I
have
done
lots
of
business
with
this
company
and
all
I
can
say
is
don't
shop
around
this
is
the
place
to
buy.
Whenever
I
register
for
classes
I
start
by
copying
and
pasting
isbn
numbers
from
my
university's
website
into
the
bookbyte
web
page.
So
far
using
bookbyte
saved
me
a
couple
hundred
dollars
per
term...
for
4
years
at
three
terms
per
year,
that's
HUGE
SAVINGS!
Cant
beat
the
prices
they
have
a
wide
selection
of
parts
definitely
well
stocked
it
there
were
additional
money
saving
perks
possibly
i
dont
want
to
sound
greedy
but
hey
why
not
offer
shipping
discounts
would
score
five
stars
but
the
shipping
is
god
awful
i
should
say
the
packaging
everything
usually
is
on
time
it
just
seems
like
either
they
got
children,
really
lazy
people,
or
monkeys
that
package
the
parts
i
actually
laugh
when
i
see
the
package
and
laugh
even
harder
saying
things
like
how
did
that
possibly
make
it
here
or
how
did
they
make
it
fit
or
are
you
effin
kidding
me
for
example
when
a
set
of
rotors
came
in
they
came
in
a
nearly
empty
oversized
box
bouncing
off
each
other
the
entire
journey
to
me
i
assumed
by
the
look
of
them
they
are
coated
with
a
paint
btw
so
it
was
obvious
(Zimmerman
rotors)
it
wont
stop
me
from
buying
from
them
but
thats
because
i
take
risks
and
dont
have
tons
of
dough
Do
like
the
fact
you
have
drive
up
gate
entry.



Low

Who

Anyway,
entrance
into
my
unit
unloading
took
the
edge
off.
Im
honestly
astonished
with
the
product
offering
from
this
company.
My
friend
in
Los
Angeles
told
me
that
he
did
an
advertising
spot
for
ClothingShopOnline.com
locally
and
told
me
I
had
to
check
out
them
out.
I
have
now
bought
from
them
twice
for
workout
gear,
and
I
am
shocked
that
I
am
able
to
get
$100
type
Lulu
lemon
workout
stuff
for
$20-$30
bucks.
Its
a
must
find
-
just
trying
to
spread
the
love
to
any
other
workout
enthusiasts
Excellent
products,
good
prices
and
excellent
delivery.

I
had
not
heard
of
Grooves
Inc
before
but
entered
a
Quiz
on
Facebook
expecting
to
just
go
on
a
mailing
list,
but
was
surprised
to
receive
an
e-mail
saying
I
had
won
100
Euros
to
spend
online
at
Grooves
Inc.
I
was
a
little
skeptical
but
visited
the
site,
which
has
a
very
good
selection
of
CDs,
DVDs
and
other
items,
and
made
my
selection.
I
used
the
code
in
the
e-mail
to
pay
and
free
delivery
was
promised
worldwide
so
my
living
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
was
a
good
test.
Good
product
and
reasonable
price.
Also
shipping
was
fast
and
on
time.
I
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone.
I
have
already
passed
on
to
a
few
friends.
I
have
always
purchased
my
tires
from
Town
Fair.
On
more
then
two
occasions
I
have
had
to
use
the
replacement
tire
option
because
of
roadside
hazards.
The
tires
were
swapped
without
question.
For
the
first
time
I
have
gone
to
snow
tires
and
they
were
very
helpful
in
choosing
the
proper
tire
for
my
vehicle.
Rotating
my
tires
have
become
a
habit
and
I
feel
it
helps
the
tire
longevity.

This
is
the
only
place
to
buy
tires.
Correspondance
by
email
was
great.
They
went
out
of
their
way
to
assist
me
and
help
me.
Delivery
was
also
fast.
The
service
I
received
was
great.
The
manager
that
helped
me
was
really
good
and
answered
all
of
my
questions.
Thanks.

Magents
arrived
promptly
and
as
ordered
but
I
have
to
buy
more
to
continue
the
experimentation
-
could
really
do
with
playing
the
wharehouse
for
a
day
to
find
the
ideal
magnet
-
but
we
will
get
there
eventually.
We
picked
Worktop
Express
because
of
their
competitive
prices
but
everything
about
the
company
was
brilliant:
excellent
show
room
with
plenty
of
assistance;
they
changed
our
order
twice
without
question,
their
delivery
was
faultless
and
exactly
on
time,
clear
and
helpful
advice
on
the
web
site.
What
more
could
you
ask
for?
Excellant
all
round
HostelBookers
was
easy
to
navigate,
had
all
the
hostels
we
were
looking
for
along
with
helpful
reviews
of
people
who
had
stayed
there
previously.
We
also
found
it
cheaper
than
all
the
other
sites
and
saved
quite
a
bit
of
money
Our
trades
association,
SJMCA,has
been
a
client
for
over
15
years
at
the
AEC
Marlton
location.

Many
things
in
life
have
changed
along
the
way
but
the
staff,
service
and
professionalism
have
been
consistent.
I
bought
two
posters,
which
arrived
a
day
after
they
said
it
would,
not
such
a
big
problem,
I
know,
but
I
would
have
liked
them
sooner.
My
biggest
problem
is
the
price,
£8.98
for
1
big
and
1
small
poster!
Personally,
I
think
this
is
unacceptable.
I
purchased
the
pearl
pink
classic
SE
II
for
my
wife
and
she
loved
it!
They
even
engraved
her
name
for
free.
Ordered
Monday
and
got
it
early
morning
Friday!
Extremely
happy
with
my
purchase.
Very
easy
site
to
navigate
and
order
from
with
much
better
prices
than
local
parts
houses.
Great
selection
to
choose
from.
Definitely

worth
the
wait
for
shipping
if
you
have
the
time
but
even
the
shipping
is
fast!

Couldn't
believe
how
easy
it
was
to
sell
our
car.

Wasn't
ready
to
buy
a
new

yet
but
ready
to
sell
one
of
our
cars.

Saw
the
commercial
on
TV
for
"webuyanycar",
got
online
to
see
the
value,
found
out
the
nearest
location
and
made
an
appointment
the
same
day.

Wasn't
sure
how
it
would
all
work
out
but
came
home
with
a
check.

It

The
company
I
work
for
needed
to
get
some
things
through
PayPal
and
I
attached
their
bank
account
and
credit
card
to
my
account
so
they
could
take

of
some

The
VERY
NEXT
DAY

They
immediately
associated
my
account
with

PayPal
account
I
had
2
years
ago
with
a
negative
balance.
Because
of
this,
the
business
is
now
UNABLE

I
really
liked
that
Bookbyte
carried
the
book
that
I
needed.
It
was
in
good
shape
and
got
to
me
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
I
was
a
little
surprised
that
I
had
to
pay
for
the
packaging
to
ship
it
back,
haven't
had
to
do
that
renting
before,
aside
from
that
no
worries
or
troubles
at
all.
I
ordered
my
part
from
PartsGeek
because
it
was
in
stock
and
it
seemed
as
though
I
would
receive
it
in
a
couple
of
days.
I
ordered
the
part
on
a
Saturday
and
I
know
that
it
wouldn't
ship
out
until
Monday.
I
did
not
receive
my
part
until
a
week
later
because
the
shipper
had
the
wrong
zip
code.
I
didn't
like
the
fact
that
I
couldn't
call
them
and
speak
with
an
agent
as
what
the
problem
was
and
how
it
could
get
resolved.
On
top
of
that
they
gave
me
a
UPS
tracking
code
on
a
FedEx
website.
Great

I
didn't

our

to
be

until
the

before
we

picked
them
up
within
an
hour
and
had
them
there
when
we
arrived
in

lost
my

so
I

I
would
buy
any
tyres
that
are
needed
from
Blackcircles,
every
time
I
need
them.
The
website
is
easy
to
use,
the
different
tyre
option
that
you
are
given
is
great
and
the
price
is
difficult
to
beat.
This
is
the
easiest
way
I
have
bought
tyres
in
years.
Looking
through
other
websites,
I
could
not
find
a
website
as
affective
as
this
one!
The
prices
were
much
higher
and
checkout
process'
were
a
lot
worse
than
this
one.
I
came
here
to
buy
a
Far

3
key,
and
I
had
it,
within
2
minutes
of

site.
I
would
recommend
this
site
to
anyone
that
wants
a
game
key
quick,
and
for
a
reasonable
price.
I
will
be
coming
back
again,
no
doubt.

rthan
I
expected
and
the
pens
are
great.
EVERYTHING
WAS
EXACTLY
LIKE
I
WANTED,
EVEN
BETTER.

THE
FOLLOW
UP
WAS
GREAT,
TIME
WAS
GOOD,
THE
LAY
OUT
VERY
PROFFSSIONAL.

I
WILL
DEFINITELY
USE
THE
SERVICE
AGAIN.
Made
appointment
to
get

Done
on
time.
Flying
Spares
is
a
fantastic
resource
for
the
many
difficult
to
obtain
parts
required
to
keep
these
fine
motor
cars
in
prime
running
condition.
Many
parts
are
no
longer
produced
by
Bentley
yet
Flying
Spares
in
most
cases
will
have
one
ready
to
ship.
The
staff
is
friendly,
knowledgable,
and
ever
ready
to
assist
one
with
any
question
and/or
need
for
their
automobile.
My
experience
with
Rush
Passport's
was
truly
excellent.
Friendly
staff,
who
efficiently
walked
me
through
the
paperwork
process,
took
my
passport
photo's
in
house,
and
had
me
out
the
door
in
20
minutes.
They
guaranteed
I
would
get
my
Passport
the
week
of
my
trip,
and
it
ended
up
coming
a
week
earlier!
Very
impressed
and
so
relieved
I'll
make
my
trip.
This
is
a
stand-out
product!
There
are
plenty
of
accessories
for
the
IPad,
but
a
protective
case
is
surely
the
most
important.
In
among
the
crowd
is
the
Snugg,
and
it
is
one
quality
piece
of
kit.
It
is
beautifully
made,
well
designed,
robust,
and
it
looks
and
feels
great.
Had
just
wanted
I
needed
No
matter
what
I
do,
my
Canon
printer
will
not
let
me
use
these
replacements.
If
I'm
looking
for
a
pen/pencil
or
a
refill
I
know
I
need
look
no
further
than
Cult
Pens.
Their
prices
are
competitive
and
their
service
is
brilliant.
I
have
been
doing
business
with
companies
for
computer
parts
for
many
years
and
was
very
pleased
with
the
way
this
company
does
business
I
am
really
satisfied
with
my
purchase
of
custom
vinyl
lettering.
I
had
no
problems
applying
the
lettering
to
my
boat.
I
am
pretty
handy
plus
the
instructions
are
very
thorough.
The
decals
themselves
were
exactly
the
size,
style
and
colors
that
I
ordered.
I
ordered
the
thicker
3M
vinyl,
but
it
was
thinner
than
I
expected.
I
thought
it
would
be
about
the
thickness
of
electricians
tape,
but
it
is
much
thinner.
Maybe
this
is
normal.
This
is
the
first
time
I've
worked
with
the
stuff
and
I
am
very,
very
pleased
with
the
results.
I
would
recommend
DIY
Vinyl
Lettering
to
others
and
will
probably
buy
from
them
again
myself.
Go
to
this
site
for
great
smelling
shaving
products
that
work.
They
choose
their
stuff
carefully
so
you
can
be
sure
it
is
worth
it.
The
reviews
by
the
passionate
buyers
are
genuinely
helpful.
This
was
an
incredibly
simple
process.
I
entered
the
phone
details,
submitted
them
to
the
site,
and
within
2
days
I
got
the
return
pack
for
the
phones,
posted
them
the
next
day,
and
in
less
than
a
week
received
my
payment
(Argos
voucher).
No
matter
where
I
go,
online
or
in
a
store,
I
always
find
myself
back
on
Supplementwarehouse.com
because
I
know
they
always
have
the
things
I
need
at
the
best
price
around.
Keep
it
up
Supplementwarehouse.com,
you're
still
the
best.
I
have
made
quite
a
few
purchases
through
STG
over
the
past
couple
years,
and
have
been
extremely
impressed
with
the
level
of
courtesy
I've
received
from
the
Company
and
all
shopping
experiences
with
them.
Seems
like
a
somewhat
young
Company,
but
also
a
very
smart
one.
Why
do
I
say
this?
Each
time
I
make
a
purchase
or
checkout
their
site,
something
is
better,
easier,
or
more
efficient.
They
stand
behind
everything
they
do
or
sell
&
follow
through.
I've
recommended
them
to
many
other
Sportbike
riders.
After
riding
Sportbikes
for
21
years
myself,
I'm
content
that
this
Company
will
keep
me
doing
what
I
love.
Lyft
is
everything
and
more.
Lyft
is
convenient.
Lyft
is
fun.
Lyft
is
revolutionary.
I
don't
ever
recall
having
a
more
experiential
and
enjoyable
ride
as
I
do
while
Lyft-ing.
I
am
so
happy
with
Lyft.
Thank
You
Logan
Green,
John
Zimmer,
and
the
entire
Lyft
team.

work.
Shipping
via
'Couriers
please'
was
much
less
convenient
than
Aust
Post
as
eventual
delivery
(i
collected)
took
two
days
longer.
Previous
compatible
Canon

were
good
as
was
Aust

Excellent
service
and
the
vehicle
was
comfortable
and
reliable.
I
have
used
Lightbulbs
Direct
for
a
couple
of
years
now.
We
built
a
new
house
and
with
that
came
the
new
rules
on
energy
efficient
lighting
,
the
problem
was
that
the
Government
insisted
on
Energy
saving
lighting
before
the
market
was
ready.
LightBulbs
Direct
have
always
been
at
the
forefront
of
Energy
efficiency
lighting.
No
problems
at
all.
Sim
works
perfectly
We
did

not
know
about
this
company
until
our
doctor's
office
suggested
it
and
their
products.

We
have
not
been
disappointed
with
either.

Their
products

have
been
good
and
delivered
very
quickly.

Can't
ask
for
anything
more.

I
would
definitely
recommend

this
company
to
anyone.

Have
used
them
on
several
occasions
and
haven't
been
disappointed
so
far.
I
have
used
laptopscreen.com
on
several
occasions
when
I
have
a
person
at
my
job
who
needs
a
laptop
screen
replacement.

The
site
is
designed
so
that
anyone
with
half
a
brain
can
navigate
it
to
find
what
they
need.

There's
no
question
that
I
will
purchase
from
this
site
again!
Just
started
with
a
unit
and
so
far
the
experience
was
seamless.
I
was
extremely
happy
to
come
away
with
a
great
looking
logo!
I
had
no
idea
of
what
to
expect,
but
came
away
with
something
that
everyone
in
our
club
liked.

The
staff
was
great
in
listening
to
the
details,
and
the
turn
around
times
for
revisions
were
as
advertised
and
sometimes
quicker!
I
was
a
little
hesitant
because
of
the
price,
but
in
the
end
the
process
and
end
product
was
well
worth
the
amount.
The
people
I
talked
with,
yes
people,
(not
the
automated
loop
b.s.
most
companies
have
before
you
talk
to
someone)
were
friendly,
knowledgable
and
very
accommodating.
If
this
hasn't
happened
for
you
give
them
a
go,
it
is
a
fantastic
experience.
Had
just
a
great
experience
with
ACityDiscount.
Ordered
Friday
night.
Delivered
by
Monday
morning.
Really
good
shirt,
especially
for
the
price!
Surprised
at
how
quick
i
received
the
shirt
I
read
a
lot
of
bad
review
on
this
company.

Reluctantly
I
went
ahead
and
order
a
2007
Tail
light
for
an
f
150.


The
dealer
wanted
almost
$200.00.

I
decided
to
to
take
the
chance
as
the
light
was
only
35.00
including
shipping
on
line.

The
product
came
as
promised
and
works
perfectly.

I
would
order
again
from
this
seller.
Went
to
the
web
site
easy
to
navigate
found
what
I
needed,
seen
the
price
and
how
long
it
would
take
to
reach
me.
After
ordering
the
part
I
receive
an
e-mail
me
letting
me
know
the
order
was
placed
properly
and
the
part
would
arrive
in
agreed
amount
of
days.
The
part
arrive
faster
then
it
was
suppose
to.
I
installed
the
part
and
I'm
along
with
the
wife
are
very
happy.
Super
service
as
promised.

Fabbulous!
I
have
ordered
4
products
from

and
have
not
been
disappointed
yet
in
how
easy
it
is
to
find
what
you
are
looking
for,
check
out,
and
even
create
reoccurring
orders
at

(huge
bonus).
Very
user
friendly.
To
add
on
that
they
honored
additional
discounts
I
was
to
received
just
as
they
said.
Usually
a
site
can't
get
everything
right,
but
they
did.
I
watched
my
shipment
arrive
and
was
responded
to
within
24
hours
of
emailing
them.
Beware
-
looks
like
these
guys
may
sell
defective
parts.
No
exchanges
in
such
cases
-
you
pay
for
return
shipping
minus
a
20%
restocking
fee,
and
then
have
to
reorder
and
again
pay
for
their
high
shipping.
Customer
service
is
limited
to
take
a
ticket
online,
and
wait
for
a
proper
response.
I'm
still
waiting...
This
is
the
second
time
that
I
have
purchased
glasses,
I
have
also
recommended
it
to
family
after
my
first
purchase.
However
my
second
order
took
much
longer,

after
using
the
online
contact
options
I
asked
for
updates
which
took
forever,
answering
:that
they
had
technical
problems.
I
waited
then
tried
using
the
telephone
numbers
listed
on
Yell.com
This
was
either
permanent
FAX
on
tel
line
or
sorry
mail
box
full
you
cannot
leave
a
message.
They
eventually
arrived.
I
ordered
an
exhaust
pipe
/
flex
pipe
for
my
daughters
Hyundai
Accent.

It
is
a
quality
replacement
part
that
was
priced
alot
less
that
I
expected.

The
on-line
order
process
was
simple
and
quick.
Also,
the
shipping
was
fast
and
on
time.
Got
a
great
deal
and
it
was
easy
to
book!
I
was
looking
for
a
particular
model
of
watch
that
I
still
own
and
love
its
reliability
and
found
a
new
one
here
at
the
best
price.Next
day
delivery
was
a
bonus

Prefer
to
use
other
internet
companies
that
dont
mislead
a

customer
on
purchases
NB
make
sure
if
you
get
a
promo
voucher
that
it
is
used
to
its
full
face
value
as
this
can
only
be
used
once
for
one
transaction
This
is
not
made
at
all
clear
and
many
bidders
fall
foul

would

It
was
very

i
would
not

to
use
the

again
I
have
been
a

of

before
and
they
have
an
app
you
can
download
on
your

where
stats
are
updated
immediately
(you
dont
have
to
wait
until
Sunday

to
see
where
you
stand).
You
can
also
make
changes
to
your

on

if
you
were
on

at

I
found
the

very
easy
to

and
to
place
my

I
ordered
on

and
my

No

I,CONNELLY
At
£20
a
ticket
online,
it
was
great
value
for
money.
The
staff
are
easy
to
find
and
friendly.
The
bus
maps
and
routes
are
very
clear
and
they
take
you
to
all
the
great
places
in
London.
The
guides
are
informative,
lively
and
do
their
best
to
help
the
passengers.
The
only
downside
being
London
traffic.
It
took
the
best
part
of
2
hours
to
get
from
London
Victoria
to
the

ACURATE
AND

We

We

have
used

a
couple
of
times
as
they
have
been
reliable,
courteous
and
offer
their

at
a
competitive
rate.
We
will
definitely
use
them
again,
and
wouldn't

to
recommend
them
to
others.
If

I
didn't
have
to
do
much
of
anything.
I
made
an
inquiry
on
Flashbay's
website
and
before
I
knew
it
David
went
to
our
website,
pulled
down
our
logo
and
sent
a
pdf
proof.

Couldn't
get
any
simpler!
The
price
was
right
also
but
it
was
the
customer
service
I
got
from
David
Chan
that
solidified
the
deal.
My
son
and
I
had
accidentally
ordered
a
game
twice,
and
I
was
worried
that
since
they
had
a
no
refund
policy
I
would
end
up
paying
for
both.
This
turned
out
to
be
false
when
I
got
on
live-chat
with
a
rep.
Since
I
had
not
claimed
either
key,
they
quickly
solved
the
issue
and
cancelled
one
of
my
orders!
We
then
quickly
received
the
key
and
my
son
was
downloading
in
no
time!
As
ordered
with
fast
delivery.

been
resolved.
Now
I
have
been
ordering
from
them
for
about
2
yrs
not
a
problem.
Won't
order
from
anywhere
else
again.
I
searched
many
websites
for
a
fridge
freezer
and
found
the
best
deal
was
for
the
zanussi
model
from
Appliancesonlin.
Best
price
offered
and
a
very
good
range
plus
quick
delivery
-
they
even
took
my
old
fridge
away
for
free
which
was
a
bonus.
I
was
kept
informed
all
of
the
way
and
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase.
I
would
recommend
the
company
to
anyone.
Nice
people--good
prices,
but,
my
most
recent
order
of
the
cat's
urinary
diet
food
still
hasn't
arrived.I
gave
3
stars
reluctantly
but
two
stars
seemed
a
little
harsh.
Our
business
doesn't
have
access
to
high
speed
internet
(all
we
can
get
is
slow
dsl),
so
when
we
started
distributing
software
to
our
clients
via
the
internet,
we
needed
a
secure
repository.

We
chose
ExVault
and
have
been
using
them
for
over
6
years
to
store
a
wide
variety
of
documents
and
files.

The
site
is
fast,
secure
and
available
wherever
and
whenever
we
need
it.

Their
upload
and
download
tools
are
superb
as
well
as
their
support
for
other
ftp
transfer
tools.

It
is
without
hesitation
that
I
would
recommend
ExVault
to
others.
Very
happy
with
BLT
and
their
very
helpful
staff!
I
was
very
impressed
at
how
quick
my
order
was
processed
and
was
ready
for
shipment.
Even
though
I
haven't
received
my
order
yet
when
its
supposed
to
be
in
my
possession
already,
they
courier
service
is
the
problem
in
my
opinion.
I
hope
my
item
shows
up
or
my
issue
is
resolved
or
rectified
just
as
quick,
but
again
praises
to
BLT
for
upholding
their
end
of
the
transaction.
Bought
three
bottles
of
Diamine
ink.

The
bottles
were
delivered
promptly
and
safely.

All
of
the
inks
excellent
and
in
use.

I
particularly
like
the
Midnight
Blue
and
Ancient
Copper.
Very
good
service.
Nice
easy
web
site,
great
to
be
able
to
obtain
what
you
want
without
having
to
wait
four
to
six
weeks.
This
company
provided
exactly
what
I
wanted,
when
I
wanted
and
at
a
very
fair
price.
The
part
that
I
bought
was
shipped
in
a
carton
that
you
could
have
shipped
50
off
the
same
part
in
it.
What
a
waist
of
money.
The
part
was
priced
right
and
was
a
good
deal.
I
would
deal
with
you
again
if
needed.
good.,,,,service

and

very

good
price
Created
a
couple
custom
Visa
cards
for
family
members
at
Christmas.
They
were
a
huge
hit,
and
super
simple
to
create.
Prompt
shipping,
too,
This
is
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
not
just
locate
Motels
but
also
the
best
for
comparison
shopping.
NICE!
I
wont
order
from
you
again.
I
bought
two
head
lights
for
a

over

and

I

followed
the

and
it
looks
as
if

was
the

up.
Not
good
for

Everything
was
perfectly
described!
These
guys
are
great
-
no

online
shopping.
Excellent
service
I
will
give
5
stars
I
have
ordered
from
other
companies
before,
but
they
are
nothing
in
comparison
to
this.
I
mean,
really,
BEAT
THE
COMPETITOR'S
PRICE?
You
will
never
see
any
supplement
company
allow
that,
and
will
force
their
price
on
you.
That,
and
you
can
get
free
stuff
just
for
ordering.
What
isn't
there
to
love?
The
shipping
is
fast
and
easy.
The
website
is
secure.
This

is
awesome.
This

I'd

I
went
staight
to
the
Shower
Doctor
website,
quickly
found
the
right
part
and
it
arrived
the
next
day.
I
watched
their
two
minute
"video

which
gave
a
great
tip
on
fixing
it
so
I
didn't

As
expected
&
quick
I
recently
purchased
a

and
was
initially
drawn
to
buy.com
from
a
google
search.
They
had
a
wide
selection
of
web
cameras
at
unbeatable
prices.
I
had
a
very
positive
experience
and
received
my
product
within
a
few
days.
Overall
wonderful
experience
and
I
have
since
purchased
many
items
from
buy.com.
Thank
you!
I
ordered
a
pair
of
extremely
hard
to
find
moccasins
from
Minnetonka
at
2am
and
received
confirmation
that
my
shoes
had
shipped
within
a
few
hours.
I
received
my
shoes
less
than
48
hours
from
my
purchasing
date
and
must
say
the
quality
is
incredible.
I
am
so
happy
with
my
shoes
and
want
to
thank
everyone
at
The
Shoe
Mart
for
updating
me
every
step
of

You
have
made

the

very
clear
about

and
when
items
have
had
to
be
ordered
in,
you
are
kept
updated
about
the
progress.
I
have
had
to
send
items
back
in
the
past
(a
stick
snapped
on
with

and
shoes
were
the
wrong
size)
both
times
I
was
either
refunded
without
any
problems
or
a
replacement
stick
was
dispatched
straight
away.
The

for

is
also
very
useful.
Overall
I
highly
recommend
the
site
and
prices
are
competitive.
Not
quite
100%
as
a
small
delay
with

The
trial
itself
perfect
for
getting
the

before
spending
lots
of
money
on
sunglasses
that
don't
fit.
After
that
service
was
exemplary,
from
giving
RxSport
my
prescription
at
the
beginning
of

my
new
Oakleys

to
my

Really
pleased
and
a

than

Would
definitely
use
again
for
my
next

and
highly
recommend
to
everyone

Requiring
a
pair
of
rock
shoes
after
recently
discovering
the
joys
of
bouldering
and
climbing,
I
looked
at
a
handful
of
different
sites
before
settling
on
Rock+Run.
Most
places
offered
a
pretty
slow
delivery
service
(3
-
5
working
days)
within
the
UK,
whereas
R+R
quoted
their
deliveries
at

1
-
4
working
days
and
indeed
the
package
arrived
after
2
days
with
no
fuss.
I
even
recommended
the
site
to
a
friend
when
they
asked
where
I
purchased
my
shoes
from.
Air
filters
fit
fine
and
price
hard
to
beat.

Factory

much!
Quick

I

to

I
had
very
good
luck
with
their

Well

Well

for
the
parts
as
the

can
not
be

I
was
amazed
how
quickly
and
efficiently
my

was

It
was
a

small

for

delivery
and
I
was
kept
well
informed
of
the
actual
time
of

during
the

I
am
well
pleased
with
the
experience
and
would

UPS

It

I
purchased
a
Littmann
Cardio
III
from
Medisave.
Not
only
was
their
price
competitive,
but
they
engraved
the
stethoscope
for
free.
I
will
purchase
from
them
in
the
future.
That
had
what
I
wanted
and
at
a
decent
price.

The
delivery
was
fast
too.
I
was
pleased
with
all
the
items
I
ordered.
I
like
their
online
shop
which
has
plenty
to
order,
especially
with
the
hard
to
find
alcoholic
beverages.
I
know
if
finding
difficulty
in
purchasing
spirits
&
liqueuers
for
my
bar,
I
only
have
to
check
The
Whiskey
Exchange
web
page.
I
have
ordered
ink
cartridges
from
Shima
Uma
before
and
they
always
have
a

The
only
criticism
is
(and
I
being
very
picky)
that
it
took
a
bit
longer
to
be
delivered.

Apart
from
that
I
am
a
happy
customer.
Good

I
recently
hit
a
deer
and
screwed
up
the
front
of
my
van.

My
first
need
was
a
headlight
assembly
before
it
rained.

The
light
still
worked,
but
the
face
was
cracked
into
pieces.

They
had
the
right
assembly.

I
had
it
overnighted,
and
received
it
in
2
days
total,
counting
from
order
to
receiving.

Fit
perfectly,
and
it
rained
later
that
afternoon.

Now
I
need
the
other
side,
as
this
looks
so
new,
and
the
other
is
as
old
as
the
van.
Merlin
have
some
of
the
cheapest
prices
on
shimano
components
on
the
net
and
a
fantastically
quick
delivery
service
to
boot.
I
would
recomend

them
to
anyone.
Jeg
bestilte

I've
bought
a
couple
of

from
CJS
CD

now,
and
for
the
most
part,
it
has
been
a
painless
procedure
of
me
ordering,
paying
and
redeeming
the

with
the
autokey
system.

I

The

and

is
excellent
and
if
you
are
thinking
of

I
recommended
that
you

I
love
PartsGeek.
I
have
been
shopping
with
Shopto.net
for
over
a
year
now
and
they
have
become
my
first
choice
for
online
shopping
in
the
gaming
market.
Once
I
always
went
to
GAME
without
looking
elsewhere
but
when
they
started
putting
their
prices
up
at
ridiculous
ammounts
and
there
delivery
service
was
gettig
appalling
I
started
looking
for
at
other
options,
I
was
pointed
to
Shopto
by
a
friend
and
was
amazed
at
the
differece
in
prices
of
the
games,
were
talking
£35.85
on
Shopto
for
a
game
where
GAME.co.uk
was
charging
£42.99
for
the
exact
same
thing.
Whats
more
Shopto
got
it
to
me
the
very
next
day
with
their
free
postage
method,
so
far
that
has
been
unmatched.
I
now
always
recieve
pre-orders
early
my
most
recent
being
Darksiders
2
which
I
got
3
days
before
launch
and
almost
all
the
time
Shopto
are
cheaper
than
everywhere
else.
The
last
game
I
bought
from
GAME
I
pre-ordered
and
didn't
recieve
it
until
a
week
after
launch,
that
is
just
unacceptable.
I
would
reccommend
Shopto
to
anyone
lookinbg
for
a
reliable
company
which
most
certainly
offers
the
best
prices
around
pretty
much
all
the
time.
great

Excellent

The
best
website
i
have
used
for
supplement
purchases.
Key
part
is
because
they
match
competitors
prices
if
their
cheaper
than
their
price
offered
on
their
website.
Not
only
do
they
match
the
price
they
also
give
you
a
5%
off
that
price.
This
shows
great
customer
service
and
makes
me
want
to
continue
to
use
supplementwarehouse.com
as
my
go
to
website
for
supplements.
Great

Great

Having
ordered
numerous
items
from
Merlin
Cycles
I
have
always
found
the
delivery
to
be
quick
and
the
pricing
extremely
competitive.

The
website
is
easy
to
use
and
the
stock
a
good

The

really
sucks.
It
is
super
powerful
and
the

and
attachments
work
very
well.
Super
easy
to

Would
highly
recommend

anyone
considering
it.
We
found
the

extremely

The
online

was
also
first

I
was

I
was
looking
for
a
website
to
buy
parts
for
my
Cherokee.
I've
used

in
the
past
for
a
Minivan
I
had,
and
not
only
did
they
have
the
parts
I
was
looking

they
were
cheaper
than
anyone
else,
apart
from
used
parts
on
auction
sites.

a

they
had

I

My
wife
and
I
booked
a
honeymoon
and
used
Viator
for
tickets
to
the
Uffizi
gallery.

The
listing
clearly
states
that
we
purchased
tickets,
and
not
a
tour
or
group.

Upon
arriving
at
the
designated
site
at
the
designated
time,
we
were
"greeted"
by
a
very
rude,
very
unhelpful
representative
who
looked
at
our
receipt
and
said
that
our
"tour"
had
left.

"We
didn't
purchase
a
tour."
I
explained,
"But
rather
tickets
to
skip
the
line."

She
quickly
stated
that
we
purchased
a
tour
and
turned
away
from
me
and
ignored
me
questions.

I
contacted
Viator's
customer
care,
and
although
the
representative
on
the
phone
admitted
the
mistake
by
Viator,
the
online
representative
DID
NOT
stand
by
their
product,
or
the
representative
and
refused
our
refund.

Viator
did
not
provide
us
with
services
or
merchandise
as
paid
for,
and
was
very
unhelpful.

DO
NOT
PURCHASE
ANYTHING
FROM
THIS
COMPANY.
I
was
having

some
days
before
I
booked
a
flight
from
Addis
Abeba
to
Jimma
in
Ethiopia.
Till
now
I
haven't
got
an
booking
confirmation,
but
no
ticket.
I
have
purchased
many
items
from
Baracuta,
and
on
the
odd
occasion
returned
them
with
no
problems.
However,
once
they
sent
my
order
to
another
customer
and
i
received
his.
They
phoned
me
to
let
me
know
of
the
mistake
but
never
offer
any
compensation,
even
though
it
took
2
weeks
for
my
order
to
finally
arrive!!!!
I
have
had
Avast

over
two
years
now
and
it
is
the

I'd
never
thought
of
using
the
fit
at
home
service,
but
as
Lee,
the
operator,
was
able
to
confirm
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
get
my
car
to
an
outlet.
However
the
service
was
terrific.
The
confirmation

on
the
day
after
my
order,
the
'I'll
be
with
you
in
10
minutes'
call
on
the
morning
of
the
fitting,
the
communication
was
faultless.
When
Lee
arrived
he
was
friendly
and
professional
and
didn't
seem
to
mind
that
I
watched
the
operation.
Not
to
check
up
on
him,
I'm
just
fascinated
by
the
mechanics
of
the

The

in
my

stopped
working
during

campout
(of
course).

American

had
the
replacement
part
I
needed,
at
a
fair
price
and
it
was
delivered
early.

I
also
eamiled
American
RV
a
question
about
the
exact
dimensions
of
the
part
and
American
RV
responded
within
a
few

I
would
use

again
for
any

that
I
might

in
the

Went

greeted
right
away.

They
got
to
me
in
a
timely
manner.

Problems
were
explained
to
me
and
a
solution
was
offered.
Why
do
people
still
insist
on
paying
full
price
for
their
games?!
This
site
saves
you
cash
and
reduces
piracy
by
making
gaming
much
more
affordable.
It
was
easy
to
order
online.
Delivery
was
on
time
as
promised.
Only
one
small
issue.
The
taillight
lens
assemblies
that
I
ordered
had
to
be
slightly
modified
to
fit
the
bulb
holders.
Not
a
big
deal
to
make
them
fit.
Otherwise
the
quality
was
great.
I
would
order
from
this
company
again.
Very

I

Also
Taunton
Leisure
were
one
of
only
a
few
on
the
Internet
selling
such
an
item
so
I
would
look
at
the
first
when
requiring
related
items
as
they
appear
to
have
an
extensive
range.
I
like
their
layout.
The
product
details
are
very
in
depth
unlike
other
companies
who
just
copy
the
description
on
the
bag
and
act
like
it's
their
summary.
I
needed
to
know
the
ingredients
in
the
dog
food
I
purchased
and
they
were
well
listed.
With
autoship,
the
prices
are
cheaper
then
my
local
stores.
The
free
shipping
is
definitely
a
plus.
No
longer

I
have
to
drive
all
over
the
place
to
find
my
holistic
pet
food.
Each
shipment
comes
in
right
before
I
finish
the
previous
bag
so
there
is
no
lapse
in
feeding
my
dog
which
has
happened
before
with
our
local
pet
supply
places.
The
dog
food
I

was

someone

I

guilty

(Oops)!
Security
is
top
notch,
which
means
it's
a
tedious
process
if
you
have
a

But,
your
stored

are
SAFE!
The

is
huge
so
make
sure
to
get
some
good

you

I've
ordered
several
bottles
from
The
Whisky
Exchange
over
the
past
few
years
and
without
exception
they
have
been
promptly
dispatched
and
safely
received.
They
keep
you
up
to
date
with
the
order
progress
via
email,
including
sending
tracking
numbers
from
their
couriers
so
that
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
when
someone
needs
to
be
in
to
receive

Highly

No

I

Met

No

Easy

Thank
You
The
prices
are
great
and
the
shipping
is
cheap
and
fast.
Also
the
parts
are
great
quality
I've
been
using
Printerinks
for
some
time
now
and
they've
never
failed
to
deliver
on
quality,
price
and
efficiency.
I'll
be
back
again
soon!
Items

They
had
the
best
price
for
a
steering
box
for
my
1967
pontiac
catalina.
i
ordered
it,
with
a
50.00
core
charge.
O.K

i
got
the
new
box
and
follow
there
directions
to
send
the
box
back
in
their
box
so

they
could
resale
the
box.
IT
COST
ME
27.00
dollars
TO
SEND
IT
BACK.
ok
.
i
put
the
new
box
on
and
LEAK
just
as
bad
as
my
original

did
the
support
ticket
to
send
the
bad
part
back,
and
want

me

PAY
THE
SHIPPING
to
return
the
bad
part
!
now
im
out
54.00
dollars
and
i
have
no
core
when
i
try
to
buy
it
somewhere

I'll
keep
there
bad

for
a

DON'T
DEAL
WITH
THIS
COMPANY.
I
live
in
Florida,
so
have
little
need
for
cool
weather
clothing
and
essentially
no
need
to
deal
with
cool
wet
weather.

In
recent
years,
fabrics
somewhat
like
Sub-Zero's
Cool
T
and
All
Active
have
gone
mass-market,
but
Sub-Zero
still
seems
more
comfortable
and
better
made.

I've
also
become
a
bit
of
a
fan
of
clothing
made
in
high-wage
countries.


My
latest
order
included
a
lightweight
smock,
made
in
EU,
which
turns
out
to
be
excellent
for
cool,
showery
days
at
the
beach.

It's
a
vastly
more
sophisticated
counterpart
to
a
simple
made-in-US
Katin
nylon
snap-closed
jacket.
Good
price
and
fast
delivery
...
but
what
is
the
point
of
giving
a
2
hour
delivery
time
slot
when
the
actual
delivery
was
1.25
hours
late?
Everything
I've
order
has
always
been
shipped
promptly,
and
is
packed
beautifully.
Will
do
business
again.

Great
price
and
fast
delivery

Bought
a
Swedish
firesteel
knife
for
canoe
camping,
the
knife
arrived
within
48
hours
of
ordering,
probably
would
have
been
faster
but
parcelfarce
did
the
whole
"attempted
delivery
thing"but
even
so,
much
quicker
than
i
expected.
the
price
was
cheaper
than
the
other
suppliers
i
found
through
google.
The
knife
itself
is
an
excellent
piece
of
kit.
A
collaboration
between
Morakniv
and
Light
my
fire,
the
long
awaited
Fireknife
is
a
must
for
outdoors
folk..
a
very
good
level
of
service
from
start
to
finish,
i
have
used
them
twice
now
and
would
again
in
the
future
There's
tons
of
parts
on
this
site
and
easy
to
find
and
all
on
one

page.
I
order
regularly
from
300RPM.
My
last
order
had
one
item
missing
when
it
arrived.
I
raised
a
support
ticket
and
received
an
email
from
Dale
apologising
and
assuring
me
it
would
be
dispatched
free
of
charge
straight
away.
I
was
very
happy
to
have
my
part
sent
to
me
quickly.
Even
though
I
received
the
wrong
part,
the
customer
service
agents
did
a
great
job
and
getting
me
the
refund
and
allowing
me
to
order
the
correct
part
and
get
it
within
one
week.
The
wind
screen
I
bought
has
made
windy
days
on
the
beach
a
thing
of
the
past.We
used
it
this
weekend
and
had
a
ball
on
the
beach.
Have
always
found
this
company's
service
to
be
excellent....such
a
pleasant
change
from
some
others
who
just
can't
be
bothered.
Screen
County
is
great.
If
I
can't
find
what
I'm
looking
for
I
just
ask
for
help
and
I
always
get
a
fast
reply.
The
quality
of
the
screens
is
excellent,
and
there
never
is
a
problem
if
a
return
needs
to
be
made,
due
to
the
wrong
part
being
ordered.
Which
very
seldom
happens
because
they
supply
a
lot
of
information
about
which
screen
or
screens
is
needed
for
the
model
number
of
the
laptop.
PetFlow
is
always
sensitive
to
the
customer's
individual
problems
and
needs,
and
their
order
fulfillment
and
delivery
system
is
very
efficient.

I
liked
the
mirrors
but
they
did
not
come
with
any
paperwork.
I
made
a
mistake
in
the
order
form,
but
it
still
got
to
me
several
days
before
I
expected,
which
I
was
very
pleased
about.
The
people
I
spoke
to
about
it
were
very
helpful,
and
there
were
no
further
problems.
The
product
is
also
very
good,
and
was
quite
cheap!
All
in
all,
I
would
definitely
buy
from
them
again.

The

the
online

was
simple

good

I
ordered
a
part
for
my
Saturn
Ion.


Their
website
helped
me
match
up
the
correct
part
I
needed
and
they
shipped
it
out
the
next
day
as
far
as
I
can
tell...
I
had
it
faster
than
I
thought
I
would.


Anyhow,
this
was
my
second
order
from
them
and
I
plan
on
continuing
to
use
them...
assuming
my
cars
will
always
need
maintenance.
Just
a
good,
reliable
company.
Item
delivered
as
promised,
in
good
condition
and
over
the
xmas

Simple,
reliable

and
usually
fast.
They
seem
to
always
have
everything
I
need.
I've
been
a
long

customer
and
would
highly
recommend
them.
Got

Able
to
take
my
design
and
turn
it
into
a
one
of
a

that
tuned

I
found
what
I
was
looking
for
in
my
area
when
searching
for
a
self
storage
unit
through
the
SpareFoot
website.
The
site
itself
was
very
clear
and
easy
to
navigate
and
even
though
I
didn't
think
I
was
ready
to
go
ahead
and
commit
to
a
space
I
felt
comfortable
enough
with
the
site
that
I
took
the
leap
and
reserved
one!
I
received
a
call
the
following
morning
from
their
agent
in
High
Point,
NC
and
she
apologized
and
said
they
really
didn't
have
the
space
I'd
reserved
even
though
the
website
indicated
there
was
at
least
one
left.
After
a
little
conversation
she
said
she
did
in
fact
have
one
she
thought
might
be
available.
We
discovered
her
hours
of
operation
were
not
as
posted
on
the
website
either.
I
went
into
the
office
and
signing
up
was
quick
and
painless
and
I'm
very
pleased
with
the
site,
the
unit
itself
and
I
think
I'd
even
consider
renting
a
larger
space.
I'd
say
I
was
overall
very
pleased
.
It
was
great
my
only
hitch
was
I
had
to
wait
a
few
hours
for
my
car
to
be
ready,
as
the
garage
was
quite
busy.
Exhaust
has
a
great
sound
Good
price,
good
delivery
time,
job
done!
Many
thanks.
It
is
early
days
yet
but,
so
far,
the
customer
sales
and
service
have
been
brilliant.
If
I
may
say
so,
I
find
that
a
large
majority
of
business
do
not
have
good
customer
service.
So,
well
done
Windsor
Telecom
on
having
great
customer
service.
I
believe
it
was
an
easy
way
to
get
a
loan
however,
they
are
certainly
robbing
you
when
it
comes
back
to
repaying
it
over
several
years
.
You
eand
up
paying
back
more
than
three
times
the
amount
you
loan.
If
I
were
in
the
position
to
loan
people
money
and
secure
it
through
the
vehicle
they
own,
I
would
only
want

about

20%

per
year.
Ie:
£2000
over
24
months
would
be
£400
for
year
1
and
£200

for
year
2.

So,
basically

you
tell
the
customer
up
front
that
they
are
not
being
robbed
and
the
should
be
able
to
afford
the
loan
repayments
of
£108.34

a
month.
All
the
aspects
of
the

but

came
in
every
day
from
prior
emails
after
close
of
that
day.
Still
great
selection
and
I
will
use
you
again!
Very
impressed
for
3
reasons:
I
couldn't
say
it
better:
B&H
provides
excellent
advice,
excellent

It's

sometimes

OK,
sometimes
not.
I
was
attracted
to
Direct2Play
by
their
low
prices
on
games.

After
doing
some
research
I
found
that
Direct2Play
has
favorable
reviews,
so
this
made
me
comfortable
with
making
a
purchase.

I
found
that
Direct2Play's
website
was
easy
to
navigate,
looked
professional
and
also
included
Live
Support.

Each
game
also
has
a
question
and
answers
section
so
you
can
ask
questions
if
you
are
unsure
about
something
and
it
was
helpful
to
see
what
others
have
asked
and
the
answers
they
had
received.

Feeling
comfortable,
I
moved
forward
and
made
a
pre-order.
Great
company,
valid
products,
no
fake
nonsense.
You
get
what
you
pay
for.
all
the
items
i
was
looking
for
were
in
stock
and
shipped
when
they
said
and
arrived
on
time
in
excellant
condition.
I
have
used
HRS
for
many
years
and
have
found
it
to
be
a
good
site.

Recently
when
I
bring
up
the
map
to
find
hotel
locations--it
is
cluttered
with
these
boxes
of
"tourist
sites.'

These
boxes
covered
the
map
making
it
very
difficult
to
find
hotels
and
streets
and
almost
impossible
to
use.
Crissy
was
wonderful...punctual
and
knowledgable!
The
flowers
we
ordered
could
not
have
been
better
if
we
had
viewed
them
in
a
shop
ourselves,
beautifully
presented,
and
delivered
as
requested.
Will
we
use
you
again,
to
true,
Nice
to
know
there
is
someone
you
can
trust.
WELL
DONE.
I
have
ordered
from
this
site
several
times
and
I
have
always
been
pleased
with
the
speed
of
delivery
and
accuracy
of
the
order.
Dear
friends,
Rented

boat
for
$635
only
to

the

there
is
no
refunds.

Will
not
use
them
again.

I
had
Bitdefender
in
the
past
and
made
the
mistake
of
switching
to
another
antivirus
software.
Not
until
I
used
the
other
for
a
while
did
I
realize
what
a
mistake
I
had
made.
The
version
I
chose
this
time
is
Total
Security
and
already
it
makes
me
feel
totally
secure,
as
do
the
Bitdefender
representatives
I
dealt
with
before
switching
back
to
Bitdefender.
You

you

other

you

Well

Excellent

Hands
down,
the
very
best
prices
I
could
find
for
my
parts,
although
they
did
not
have
quite
everything
I
needed.
I
had
to
wait
almost
two
weeks
to
get
my
parts
but
considering
the
price
of
shipping
and
handling,
I
am
not
about
to
complain.
The
parts
arrived
very
well
secured
and
with
absolutely
no
damage.
I
will
definitely
be
using
these
guys
again
so
long
as
I
am
not
in
a
rush
to
get
my
parts.

They
would
probably
be
called
Interparcel.
Its
an
easy
to
use
service
and
cheaper
than
booking
with
the
actual
courier
firm
who
collect
your
delivery.
All
down
to
economies
of
scale.
You
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
Interparcel
dont
have
their
own
national
network
of
drivers
so
they
"piggyback"
on
the
likes
of
City
Link
&
TNT.
Then
take
in
to
account
that
they
rely
on
the
contracted
firm
to
do
the
physical
job
so
they
are
never
in
100%
control
of
your
delivery.
That
said
I
am
on
my
4th
booking
with
them
and
so
far
so
good.

sales
tax.
I
came
over
to
B
and
H
and
not
only
do
they
not
charge
sales
tax,
but
they
informed
me
of
a
rebate.
I
was
also
able
to
add
on
all
my
accessories
all
in
one
place.
I
use
SquareTrade
on
a
personal
and
professional
level.

While
my
experience
personally
is
limited,
thankfully,
from
a
professional
matter
we
use
them
to
cover
all
electronics
in
the
office.

We
only
have
had
to
do
one
claim
as
of
yet,
but
with
just
a
minor
hiccup
they
resolved
it
on
their
end
for
the
shipping
label
to
be
sent
to
us.

The
repair
was
back
promptly
and
the
end
user
loves
that
his
iPad
is
operational
again.
Excellent
service
from
this
company,
looking
for
a
belt
for
my
technics
deck,
purchased
online
hassle
free,
and
you
cant
forget
the
company
because
when
you
make
a
cuppa
the
FREE
fridge
magnet
lets
you
know
where
you
purchased
from.
Just
ordered
the
MT3,
on
delivery
had
a
slight
problem??
Part
on
website
said
new
but
when
arrived
it
was
a
reconditioned
part
It
can
be
aggravating
to
shop
for
professional
video
and
audio
equipment
online,
especially
when
you
are
looking
for
performance
specifications
that
will
make
or
break
a
purchase.
B&H
largely
takes
the
guesswork
out
of
choosing
equipment
by
providing
accurate
product
specs,
plenty
of
helpful
customer
reviews,
and
easy
comparison
tools.
And
having
such
a
vast
selection
helps
me
find
the
right
tool
for
what
I
need
to
accomplish.
To
put
it
simply,
B&H
"gets
it"
when
it
comes
to
professionals
in
the
media.
Dont
think
I
will
be
using
this
company
again
Best
prices
on
the
net.
Easy
shipping.
Fast
and
reliable.
I've
also
sent
an

with
no

Paid
on

Order:

If
there
is
a

a
response
to

request
would
be
appreciated.
If
you
are
unable
to
fulfill
order
a
refund
would
be
due.
The
material
I
ordered
was
of
great
quality.
Shipping
was
amazing,
I
had
my
order
two
days
after
I
placed
it.
Having
made
a
survey
among
different
currency
exchange
providers
I
sincerely
think
this
is
the
best
exchange
service.
I
have
done
two
transfers,
both
have
been
fast
and
their
exchange
rate
and
comission
seems
unrivalled
at
the
moment.
Fine
experience
Glad
to
know
that
there
is
an
excellent
source
of
One
Time.
Reliable
and
effective
-
vey
happy
with
my
order.
I
was
able
to
navigate
the
website
very
easily
to
find
the
storage
information
I
needed.
I
also
liked
the
variety
of
storage
locations
and
how
each
location
provided
a
description
of
all
the
services
offered.
I
also
appreciated
how
easy
it
was
to
register
online,
and
that
I
was
not
required
to
give
any
monies
or
credit
card
information
upfront
until
I
actually
saw
the
storage
unit
and
met
the
management.
Last
but
not
least,
I
received
a
call
from
the
storage
location
I
selected
the
very
next
day,
thanking
me
for
registering,
and
asking
me
if
I
had
any
questions.
I
was
thrilled
beyond
words.
It
was
easy
to
find
and
order
the
part
I
needed.

I
had
visited
several
other
parts
sites
Ordered
usual
delivery,
came
next
day
so
great
service.
I
bought
a
great
little
head
torch
-
which
was
cheap
(£11)
and
is
great,
if
a
little
temperamental
-
but
works
most
of
the
time!
Very
competitive
price,
no
problems
at
all
with
transaction.
My
7
year
old
Samsung
DLP's
Color
Wheel
failed.

I
called
a
local
Samsung
repair
place,
and
they
said
it
would
take
at
least
a
week
and
cost
$400-$800.

I
did
a
search
for
the
part
online
and
came
across
MCM
Electronics
which
had
the
part
for
$137
including
S&H.

On
YouTube
I
found
several
videos
on
how
to
replace
it.

It
took
an
hour
to
get
the
old
part
out
(working
carefully)
and
45
minutes
to
install
the
new
part
and
put
it
back
together.

It
worked(!)
the
first
time.

I
would
highly
recommend
MCM.
Ordered

their
product
(1970
mustang
302
motor
mounts)
and
received
it
quickly.
Haven't
installed
it
yet
and
they
do
look
a
little
different.
Great
way
to
buy
my
dogs
food
since
I
live
a
long
way
from
any
business
that
sells
the
type
she
eats.

Free
shipping
and
now
it
will
be
here
right
on
time
whenever
she
needs
it.

Thanks
for
a
great
experience.
I
have
to
say
the
best
part
of
Pcgamesupply
for
me
is
they
have
no
additional
charge
for
the
service
provided.
It
was
fast
and
I
was
back
to
gaming
in
a
couple
of
minutes.
I
was
without
concern
of
being
frauded
and
had
that
feeling
of
security.
I
highly
recommend
this
sight
for
any
gamer!
Placed
an
order
for
several
sets
of
lights.

One
didn’t
work
and
one
was
missing
from
the
order.

The
company
refused
to
respond
so
I
am
left
out
of
pocket.
Smooth
transaction
in
every
way:
Great
product
selection,
fine
quality,
convenient
packaging,
fair
prices,
reasonable
"shipping
and
handling"
(often
a
ripoff
with
other
suppliers),
speedy
delivery.
Couldn't
ask
for
better
service.
Bolt
Depot
is
now
my
vendor
of
choice.
My
wife's
Mother
passed
away
and
we
ordered
a
black
12"
x
24"
x
4"
Granite
site
marker
for
her.
The
stone
was
delivered
in
only
3
days!

The
cemetery
said
it
would
have
taken
them
60
days
or
more
to
have
a
marker
made
and
it
wouldn't
equal
this
one!
So
far
the
best
site
for
all
my
shaving
necessities,
the
products
are
top
notch
and
the
shipping
is
very
fast.
Highly
recommended
this
for
gentlemen
trying
to
take
their
grooming
and
shaving
to
the
next
level.
same
as
above!

Having
experienced
and
knowledgeable
staff,good
service,
good
prices
and
quick
delievey
is
hard
to
beat,
That's
what
I
think,
aside
from
the
CS
that
maybe
is
defficient
and
slow,
the
service
itself
does
it
right,
if
you
have
a
problem,
mostly
is
client-side
(your
PC
fault
or
Your
fault...)
I've
already
purchased
like
4
or
5
times
in
PCGameSupply
PSN
Cards,
always
