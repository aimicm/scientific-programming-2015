    "## Manipulating files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make directories `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`.\n",
    "* Delete directories `c` and `d`.\n",
    "* Create the nested directory structure `Adam/Cain/Enoch/Arad/Mehujael/Methushael/Lamech/Jabal`. \n",
    "* Make an empty file called `nothing_here` and verify that its size is 0 bytes.\n",
    "* Write your name in a file called `my_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download and extracting data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download [inaugural.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1423772/sciprog/inaugural.zip) to your home directory and unzip it.\n",
    "* Download [reviews.tar.gz](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1423772/sciprog/reviews.tar.gz) and untar it.\n",
    "* Recursively copy the directory `/home/johannsen/movie_reviews` to your home directory, if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting lines from files\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grep for the famous Kennedy quote from his inaugural address. The one about not asking what can be done for you but what you can do.\n",
    "* Display the last line of the 1861 Lincoln inaugural address.\n",
    "* Combine `head` and `tail` to show lines 50-70 of the `reviews.tsv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting columns and rows from files\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `cut`, `tr`, `sort` and `uniq` to find the ten most common words in the text column of the `reviews.tsv` file. \n",
    "* As above but lowercasing the words using `tr`.\n",
    "* Advanced: Find the ten most common words in the file *excluding* stopwords. You may find a list of stopwords at `/home/anders/english_stopwords.txt`. Use `grep -v` to filter out the stopwords. You will need to use several other options for this to work. \n",
    "* Count the number of reviews written by males (M) and females (F) in the `reviews.tsv` file.\n",
    "* Create two new files `reviews.male.txt` and `reviews.female.txt` collecting reviews by males and females from the `reviews.tsv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python and pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Place the script below in a file called `describe.py`. One option is to open the file in the `nano` editor and paste the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = []\n",
    "for line in sys.stdin:\n",
    "\tnumbers.append(float(line.strip()))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pd.Series(numbers).describe())\n",
    "````\n",
    "* Using the script above, calculate the mean of the numbers `5 2 9 5 2 1 5 7`.\n",
    "* Use `wc -w` to find the mean number of tokens in positive and negative movie review (in the `movie_reviews` directory)?\n",
    "* How long are the longest and the shortest of Roosevelt's inaugural addresses?"
