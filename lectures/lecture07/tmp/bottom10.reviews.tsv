21	M	I've already purchased like 4 or 5 times in PCGameSupply PSN Cards, always they're almost Instant Issued to my account - orders before I notice...
NONE	M	Got my labels quickly, and they look fantastic. Thanks!
NONE	M	I have just sold my I-phone to envirophone and I am glad to say got a good price and excellent service. I will certainly use them again and recommend  them to you if you have a spare phone to dispose of if you have just upgraded. Give them a try what have you got to lose?
NONE	F	Well structured website, helpful with good reviews and videos.
NONE	F	I have 5 dogs and I like to order toys for them.  None of the 5 were interested in your Gumby Toy.  How have other dogs reacted to Gumby?
NONE	F	I have used easytobook for the last 8 years and couldnt be happier with the website and service: the prices are lower than most other hotel websites and the page is easy to navigate. The page layout is extremely important if someone wants to such a large number of hotels and doesnt have too much time on their hands.
NONE	F	i ordered for the first time a month or so ago. i ordered two dresses and three tops. i returned both the dresses and one of the tops. these three items had a total of 55 pounds but i was only refunded 48. I do not know why 7 pounds was deducted and this is unacceptable.
NONE	M	Did not receive my items from a seller, pay pal would not refund the money. They said the seller provided a shipping/tracking # only half the order was in this box. Pay Pal Sucks
NONE	M	Fast and convenient.
NONE	M	I buy some toners to printer and I buy it again in hunt office.
