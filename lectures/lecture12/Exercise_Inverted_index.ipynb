    "## Exercise: The inverted index\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverted index is the data structure that drives unstructured ad-hoc text retrieval, and it has no real competitors. The inverted index makes searching at web scale (billions of documents) possible and efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you are going to implement an inverted index and use it to retrieve songs by lyrics from the *One Million Song* data set. Because we use a high-level interpreted language and do not pay painstaking attention to code efficiency, the code you develop in this exercise may not be completely ready to take on the whole web. But you will know the basic principles.\n",

    "Download [the lyrics in TSV format](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1423772/sciprog/mxm_dataset_preprocessed.tsv)  and place the file in the current directory. The data has a line for each of about 779,000 songs. The first column is a song id, followed by artist name and song title. The last column of the line contains the lyrics of the song. It's in a bag-of-words format, meaning that the original linear sequence of the words is not preserved. Each word is associated with a count - the number of times it occured in the original lyrics. Below is an example of a line from the file:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the exercise above you might have noticed that a lot of unnecessary work is done when intersecting a small postings list like that for *pan* and huge ones for common words like *and*. In a nutshell the problem is that the large list has an entry for almost every document, while there may be thousands of documents between entries in the smaller list. And yet we dutifully check every entry in the larger list against the smaller list. Is it possible to skip ahead?\n",

    "3. perhaps got lucky and landed exactly at the correct element in the larger list. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of 1) or 2), we make another jump to get closer to the correct element. In case the jump overshot, we know that the value we are searching for must be between the initial value and the place we landed. This gives us a search space. If every jump halves the search space, this approach is called binary search. It may happen that the larger list does not contain the current entry of the smaller list. We can detect this situation when the search space spans nothing. \n",

    "Binary search may be one of the simplest algorithm out there, but despite its conceptual simplicity it needs careful implementation.\n",
