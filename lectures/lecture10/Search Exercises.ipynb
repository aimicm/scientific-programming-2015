    "Search\n",
    "====\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common (and most useful) operations on graphs is search. We said earlier that graphs are so powerful because they can naturally depict a lot of objects, and search made that even clearer. However, in order to do search, we translate the ***state*** **graph** to a ***search*** **tree**. This is a very important distinction!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the state graph and adjacency matrix we will use:\n",
    "<img src=state_graph.png width=450px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***state graph*** is a representation of the problem, or the world in which the problem occurs. The ***search tree*** is a snapshot of our progress towards the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence was the realization that we can use search in order to find the best next steps in a game. When Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov in chess, much of its success was based on clever search implementations (see also http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/ for an interesting analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "A game can be modelled as a succession of states, and a goal is any state in which we win.\n",
    "In order to find the best strategy, we depict each game state as a tree node, with the current state as root, and try to find the best path to a goal node. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important decisions we need to make is how to represent each state, i.e., what kind of information it contains (position of the pieces, whose turn it is, etc.). \n",
    "The children of each node are the states that correspond to the result of some action. So if we are at a point in the game where we have the choice between taking a magic sword or not, the child nodes of the current state are the one where we have the sword, and the one where we don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "We traverse a search-tree by going down the tree to find the best outcome node (with whatever \"best\" is in our case).\n",
    "We can then either return the best node we found, or the path (i.e., the other nodes and potentially the actions that were involved in reaching them) that were visited along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to search would be of course to simply look at each node in the tree until we have found our goal. While this is guaranteed to find the goal, it is impossible for most real-life applications. It would either take waaaay too long, or it would simply never finish: some search trees can be gigantic, or infinite (the number of states for a chess game is allegedly something like $10^{10^{50}}$).\n",
    "One way around this is to limit the depth to which you search, and to keep track of the nodes you already visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, tree-search works as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "def search(tree, goal, strategy):\n",
    "    <b>visited</b> = set()\n",
    "    get start node\n",
    "    add start node to <b>strategy</b> and <b>visited</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "    while <b>strategy</b> is not empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "        <b>current</b> = choose next node from <b>strategy</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "        if <b>current</b> == <b>goal</b>:\n",
    "            return <b>current</b>\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            for child in <b>current</b>.children:\n",
    "            if child is not in <b>visited</b>:\n",
    "                <b>visited</b>.add(<b>current</b>)\n",
    "                expand <b>strategy</b> with child\n",
    "\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks almost like Python, but not quite. The reason is that there are different search algorithms, and they mainly differ in the strategy they use, i.e., what kind of data structure they use in order to decide on the next node to visit (this is a popular job-interview question). We will look at some of the most well-known search algorithms. They apply to different problems, but they all use this basic structure, and only differ in the type of data structure they use for choosing the next state (this is a popular programming interview question).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encode the adjacency matrix in a `numpy` matrix."
