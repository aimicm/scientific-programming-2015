## Course plan

### Computational thinking

*If your tool is a computer, everything begins to look like a list of numbers.*.

- Recap of the syntax of Python. 
- How to start solving a problem using an algorithm.
- Thinking about algorithms in terms of how many operations they require and how much memory they use.
- Pancakes!

### Descriptive statistics

*Data is the new bacon.*

- How to organize a dataset. 
- Thinking about instances and variables.
- Grouping data.
- Intuition about significance testing

### Visualing data

*The eye is by far our most powerful tool of analysis.*

- What are the different types of plots, and what can you use them for? 
- Matplotlib essentials (= one hour of headaches).
- Tufte's information density theory of plotting.
- Plotting and cognition.

### Linear algebra and numerical computing

*You find yourself enrolled in a program to become a master of matrices.*

- How computers represent numbers. 
- Basic operations on vectors and matrices.


### Supervised learning I

- How is learning possible? 
- Smoke detectors and the linear model.
- Implement the perceptron, a simple learning classification algorithm.

### Supervised learning II

- Probabalistic models: Logistic regression.
- Energy-based learning, a general model. 

### The environment

*Ninjas dress in black to hide in the background of your terminal window.*

- Files and the file system. 
- The philosophy of Unix.
- 

### Images I

- Painting with numbers.
- Morphological operations.

### Images II

- Identifying and labeling parts of images.
- Going from continous coordinate spaces to pixel spaces.

### Graphs I

- Two strategies of unguided graph search: depth-first, breadth-first. 
- Using heuristics to cut corners: A\*-search.
- Graph search and finding your way on a map.

### Graphs II

- Graphs as markov chains. 
- Random walks. 
- Analysis of social graph data sets: data from social networks.

### Information Retrieval

*How can Google find anything in no time?*

- The inverted index data structure. 
- Auto-completion using the Trie data structure.
